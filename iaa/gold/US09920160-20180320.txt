CROSS REFERENCE OF RELATED APPLICATION
This is a U.S. National Stage under 35 U.S.C 371 of the International Application PCT/CN2015/077818, filed Apr. 29, 2015, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(a-d) to CN 201410444760.1, filed Sep. 3, 2014.
BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION
Field of Invention
The present invention relates to a method for a synthesis of a polymer containing multiple functional groups, and more particularly to a method for a synthesis of a polymer containing multiple epoxy groups. The polymer containing the multiple epoxy groups contains thioether bonds and has an average molecular weight larger than 300 g/mol.
Description of Related Arts
The polymer containing multiple epoxy groups is a type of multifunctional polymer containing multiple highly-active epoxy groups. The epichlorohydrin which is catalyzed by the alkali reacts with the phenolic compound, and the prepared epoxy resin generally has a relatively high viscosity. During synthesis, the generated sodium chloride is required to be removed through water washing several times. In the epoxy resin, a small number of organic chlorines and inorganic chlorine ions still exist, causing a decreased electrical performance of the epoxy resin part. It is feasible to prepare the epoxy resin through hydrogenating the unsaturated olefin. The type of the polymer containing the multiple epoxy groups does not contain chlorine elements and has a good electrical performance. The type of the cycloaliphatic epoxy compound has a low reactivity, the acid anhydride compound is generally adopted to serve as a curing agent, and a relatively high curing temperature is required to initiate a cross-linking reaction. The polyglycidyl methacrylate is an epoxy resin containing multiple epoxy groups. The epoxy groups are connected with the ester groups which are easily hydrolysable, leading to a poor chemical stability. Moreover, the polyglycidyl methacrylate is solid at a room temperature, and, during using, it is required to add the organic solvent into the polyglycidyl methacrylate, so as to improve the workability. Thus, compared with the conventional epoxy resins, the polymer containing the multiple epoxy groups, prepared by the present invention, has a relatively low intrinsic viscosity, flexible polythioether main chains and a great number of the highly-active epoxy groups. The polymer is able to be widely applied as the matrix of advance coating, adhesive, composite materials and so on. Until now, how to prepare the polymer containing the multiple epoxy groups with fast speed, simpleness, convenience, and high yield is still a challenging problem.
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for a synthesis of a polymer containing multiple epoxy groups, so as to solve problems in conventional epoxy resin synthesis methods. The polymer containing the multiple epoxy groups contains thioether bonds and has an average molecular weight larger than 300 g/mol.
Technical solutions of the present invention are described as follows.
A method for a synthesis a polymer containing multiple epoxy groups comprises steps of:
under protection of nitrogen or argon, successively adding 1 mole of substance A, 0.5-10 moles of solvent, 0.9-1.1 moles of substance B, and 0.005-0.05 moles of photosensitive free radical initiator into a reactor; irradiating with an ultraviolet light for 0.5-4.0 hours; and, after precipitating, separating, and drying, obtaining the polymer containing the multiple epoxy groups; wherein:

When the substance B is a mixture of a fluorescent compound containing alkynyl and the substance C, it is feasible to mix the fluorescent compound containing the alkynyl and the substance C in any proportion.
The photosensitive free radical initiator is obtained through mixing at least one member selected from a group consisting of benzoin dimethyl ether, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone, benzophenone, 4-chlorobenzophenone, 4-methylbenzophenone, 4-phenylbenzophenone, isopropylthioxanthone, 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone, 2-methyl-4-(methylthio)-2-morpholinopropiophenone, methyl phenylglyoxylate, methyl 2-benzoylbenzoate, 2-ethylhexyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoate, ethyl 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzoate, phenylbis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide, diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide, ethyl phenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphinate, a mixture of the benzophenone and the 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone with a mass ratio of 1:1, and a mixture of the 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone and the 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone with a mass ratio of 1:4 in any proportion.

The present invention has following beneficial effects.
The present invention adopts a strategy of thiol-yne polymerization. Under an initiation effect of free radicals, the thiol successively proceeds an addition reaction with the alkynyl for two times, so as to obtain the polymer containing the multiple epoxy groups and the thioether bonds. A molecular weight, a molecular structure, and a content of epoxy groups of a product are able to be flexible adjusted and controlled. Compared with prior arts, the preparation method provided by the present invention has obvious advantages of: utilizing characteristics of high efficiency and fast speed of the thiol-yne polymerization, simple and convenient process, wide application scope, easy processing after producing, simple operation, strong controllability, and high yield.
