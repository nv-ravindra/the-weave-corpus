RELATED APPLICATION INFORMATION
This application is a 371 of International Application No. PCT/EP2015/073119, filed Oct. 7, 2015, which claims priority to EP Application No.; 14188743.0 filed Oct. 14, 2014, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.
The present invention relates to the preparation of halo-substituted 1-aryl-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanones (compounds Ia, Ib and Ic): and to intermediates useful for this process. Said compounds are important intermediates for the preparation of pesticidally active isoxazoline-substituted benzamides as for example 1-(3,5-dichloro-4-fluoro-phenyl)-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanone (Ic) disclosed in EP 1932836A1.
Typically said compounds of formula Ia, Ib and Ic are synthesized by reaction of corresponding organometallic reagents derived from halo-substituted 5-bromo benzenes of formuae IIa, IIb and IIc with the derivatives of trifluoroacetic acid (for example ethyl trifluoroacetate). For example, the preparation of 2,2,2-trifluoro-1-(3,4,5-trichlorophenyl)ethanone (I b) is described in WO 2012/120135.
The corresponding bromo derivatives of the formulae IIa, IIb and IIc are not easily available and prepared via multistep procedures. For example, 5-bromo-1,2,3-trichloro-benzene (II b) can be prepared as described in Narander, N.; Srinivasu, P.; Kulkarni, S. J.; Raghavan, K. V. Synth. Comm. 2000, 30, 3669 and Sott, R.; Hawner, C.; Johansen, J. E. Tetrahedron 2008, 64, 4135.
5-bromo-1,3-dichloro-2-fluoro-benzene (II c) is especially difficult to prepare in particular on a large scale with the only described synthesis being an inefficient multistep approach described in Miller, M. W.; Mylari, B. L.; Howes, H. L.; Figdor, S. K.; Lynch, M. J.; Lynch, J. E.; Koch, R. C. J. Med. Chem. 1980, 23, 1083, CN 101177379, CN 101337862 and CN 103664511 (Scheme 1).
A significant disadvantage of these known processes is the low overall yields caused by the large number of reaction steps (4-6) and consequently high production cost. Moreover the synthesis generates large quantities of waste and has low atom economy.

It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of halo-substituted 1-aryl-2,2,2-trifluoro-elhanones with a reduced number of reaction steps, high yield and substantially lower production costs.
Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen, fluoro or chloro; which process comprises
a) reacting a compound of formula II wherein R1 is hydrogen, fluoro or chloro; with a nitration agent to the compound of formula wherein R1 is hydrogen, fluoro or chloro; and
b) reacting the compound of formula Ill with chlorine gas at temperature from 180° C. to 250° C. to the compound of formula I.
Reaction step a):
Compounds of formula II are commercially available and several methods are reported in the literature for their preparation. For example, compounds of formula II, wherein R1 is hydrogen or chloro, can be easily synthesized in high yields via Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene and chlorobenzene respectively with trifluoroacetyl chloride or trifluoroacetic anhydride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (aluminium chloride). However, the preparation of a compound of formula II, wherein R1 is fluoro, via Friedel-Crafts method is only reported in a single publication using expensive 1-(trifluoroacetyl)-4-(dimethylamino)pyridinium trifluoroacetate as an acylating agent. The compound of formula II wherein R1 is fluoro, can be synthesized in analogy to the synthesis of compound of formula II wherein R1 is chloro, using trifluoroacetyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride in good yield.
The compound of formula III, wherein R1 is hydrogen, is known (CAS 1960-27-6) and can be prepared via nitration according to Canadian Journal of Chemistry,1964 ,vol. 42, p. 439446; and Journal of the American Chemical Society,1981, vol.103, # 8 p. 2041-2045.
The compound of formula Ill, wherein R1 is fluoro, is novel and was developed specifically for the preparation of the compounds of formula I. Accordingly, said compound also form part of the subject matter of the present invention.
The nitration of the compounds of formula II can be performed using nitration agents like a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid (10-15 equiv. (concentrated or fuming)), and concentrated or fuming nitric acid (2.2-2.5 equiv.) without solvent at temperatures of 100° C.-160° C., preferably 120° C.-140° C. Instead of nitric acid its sodium or potassium salts (sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate) can be also used. Also to minimize the sulfuric acid waste and to improve conversion of starting material and shorten the reaction times, a combination of fuming sulfuric acid (20, 30 or 66% dissolved SO3) and fuming nitric acid (90-100%) is advantageously used. For example, fuming sulfuric acid with 30% SO3 content in combination with 99% fuming nitric acid allows reducing the use rate of sulfuric acid by 50% (5-7 equiv.).
Typically a mixture of di-nitro substituted compounds of formula Ill (major product) and mono-nitro substituted compounds of formula IV wherein R1 is hydrogen, fluoro or chloro, is produced. This mixture is easily separable by distillation and the recovered mono-nitro compounds can be subjected to nitration together with compounds of formula II.
This makes the whole process very efficient and high yielding.
Reaction step b):
Substitution of an aromatic nitro group on chlorine atom using chlorine gas at high temperatures (200° C.) is a well-known transformation. However, this transformation is only applicable to a special class of substrates witch can tolerate such drastic conditions. There are no prior art examples known of a substitution on substrates having trifluoroacetyl group in the aromatic ring.
The reaction is performed by passing chlorine gas through a neat compound of formula IV (no solvent) at temperatures ranging preferably from 180° C. to 250° C., more preferably from 200° C. to 220° C. The product can be advantageously removed by distillation during the reaction. This also accelerates conversion of the remaining starting material. A slight vacuum can be applied to facilitate the distillation. If the product cannot be efficiently removed by distillation during the course of the reaction (small scale reactions, not enough material to be continuously distilled), the unreacted starting material of formular III (if there is any left) and the reaction intermediate of formula V (if there is any left) wherein
R1 is hydrogen, fluoro or chloro,
can be separated from product by fractional distillation afterwards and re-used in the next run.

Preparation of the Compound of Formula IIc: 2,2,2-trifluoro-1-(4-fluorophenyl)ethanone
In a 2 L glass reactor equipped with a cooling circulator, a mechanical stirrer and a glass pipe for gas introduction, was placed fluorobenzene (865 g, 9.00 mol). The reactor's content was cooled to −5° C. and finely-powered anhydrous aluminum chloride (444 g, 3.30 mol) was added in one portion. A stream of trifluoroacetyl chloride gas (400 g, 3.02 mol) was introduced under the liquid surface over a period of 3 h at −5° C. (2.2 g /min). Reaction off-gas was scrubbed in a 10% sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for additional 3 h at 0° C. and then it was slowly added to ice-cold water (1200 g) while keeping the temperature below 30° C. (intensive cooling required). The aqueous lower layer was separated and the organic layer was washed with water (300 mL). The product was isolated by fractional distillation using 50 cm Vigreux column as follows: Most of fluorobenzene was distilled at normal pressure while increasing the bad temperature from 100 to 140° C. Then the bad temperature was reduced to 80° C. and the apparatus was evacuated to 200 mbar. After distilling remaining fluorobenzene the product was collected at the head temperature of 100-101° C. (200 mbar). Yield 437 g. According to the quantitative 1H NMR analysis (1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane as an internal standard) the material had purity of 99%. The recovered fluorobenzene (546 g) was used in the next run.
Als spectroscopic data were in agreement to those of commercially available material.
