FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing 5-fluoro-1-methyl-3-difluoromethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde (I), a useful intermediate in the manufacture of fungicides.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Processes for exchanging chlorine for fluorine (halex processes) are known particularly for 5-chloro-1,3-dialkyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonyl chlorides (cf. for example WO 2007/031212 and EP-A 0 776 889). It is also known from WO 2011/061205 that 5-fluoro-1-alkyl-3-fluoroalkyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonyl chlorides can be prepared by reacting in a first step 5-chloro-1-alkyl-3-fluoroalkyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde with metal fluorides like KF as fluorinating reagent to obtain 5-fluoro-1-alkyl-3-fluoroalkyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde, followed by a second reaction with a chlorinating agent to obtain the acyl chloride derivatives.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It has now been found that the fluorination occurring in the preparation of 5-fluoro-1-methyl-3-difluoromethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde from 5-chloro-1-methyl-3-difluoromethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde can be significantly and surprisingly accelerated and improved by the utilization of a phase transfer catalysts selected among tetrabutylammonium chloride, bromide or hydrogen sulphate in dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide as solvent. Under such conditions, it is possible to reduce both the reaction time and the amount of potassium fluoride used for the fluorination, leading to a cheaper and more sustainable process.
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 5-fluoro-1-methyl-3-difluoromethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde of formula (I) characterized in that 5-chloro-3-(difluoromethyl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde of formula (II) is reacted with potassium fluoride of formula (III)

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The process according to the invention can be illustrated by the following formula scheme: where the fluorination is performed with potassium fluoride in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst selected among tetrabutylammonium chloride, bromide or hydrogen sulphate, preferably tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate, in dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide as solvent.
5-Chloro-1-alkyl-3-fluoroalkyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehydes are known or obtainable by known methods (cf. J. Het. Chem. 1990, 27, 243, WO 2006/018725).
5-Chloro-1-alkyl-3-difluoroalkyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde of formula (II) can be prepared according to WO 2011/061205.
Potassium fluoride is a known synthesis chemical.
Reaction temperature in the process according to the invention is from 130° C. to 160° C., preferably from 145° C. to 155° C.
Reaction time is from 2 to 4 hours, preferably 3 hours.
The process according to the invention is carried out by using generally from 1 to 1.5 mol, preferably from 1.1 to 1.5 mol, of potassium fluoride per mole of 5-chloro-1-methyl-3-difluoromethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde of formula (II).
The process according to the invention is carried out by using generally from 1 to 5 mol % of the phase transfer catalyst per mole of 5-chloro-1-methyl-3-difluoromethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde of formula (II).
The process is preferably performed in equipment which is not a glass equipment, because KF can react under the reaction conditions with the glass equipment to produce side products (H2O). Teflon or stainless steel equipment is preferable.
The process can be performed under normal atmosphere or under pressure (in closed vessel).
The potassium fluoride is generally used as a spray-dried.
