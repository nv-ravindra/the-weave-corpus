BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its derivative compounds are known as essential coenzymes in cellular redox reactions in all living organisms. Several lines of evidence have also shown that NAD participates in a number of important signaling pathways in mammalian cells, including poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in DNA repair (Menissier de Murcia et al., EMBO J., (2003) 22, 2255-2263), mono-ADP-ribosylation in the immune response and G protein-coupled signaling (Corda and Di Girolamo, EMBO J., (2003) 22, 1953-8), and the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinate adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) in intracellular calcium signaling (Lee, Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., (2001) 41, 317-345). Recently, it has also been shown that NAD and its derivatives play an important role in transcriptional regulation (Lin and Guarente, Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol., (2003) 15, 241-246). In particular, the discovery of Sir2 NAD-dependent deacetylase activity (e.g., Imai et al., Nature, (2000) 403, 795-800; Landry et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., (2000) 278, 685-690; Smith et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, (2000) 97, 6658-6663) drew attention to this new role of NAD.
The Sir2 family of proteins consumes NAD for its deacetylase activity and regulates transcription by deacetylating histones and a number of other transcription regulators. Because of this absolute requirement for NAD, it has been proposed that Sir2 proteins function as energy sensors that convert the energy status of cells to the transcriptional regulatory status of genes (Imai et al., Nature, (2000) 403, 795-800; Imai et al., Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol., (2000) 65, 297-302). Sir2 proteins produce nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose in addition to the deacetylated protein substrates in their deacetylation reaction (Moazed, Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol., (2001)13, 232-238; Denu, Trends Biochem. Sci., (2003) 28, 41-48; see also FIG. 1), and nicotinamide is eventually recycled into NAD biosynthesis. Unlike other NAD-dependent biochemical reactions, the NAD-dependent deacetylase activity of the Sir2 family of proteins is generally highly conserved from bacteria to mammals (Frye, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., (2000) 273, 793-798), suggesting that the connection between NAD and Sir2 proteins is ancient and fundamental. In mammals, the Sir2 ortholog, Sirt1/Sir2α, has been shown to regulate metabolism in response to nutrient availability (Bordone and Guarente, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol., (2005) 6, 298-305). In adipocytes, Sirt1 triggers lipolysis and promotes free fatty acid mobilization by repressing PPAR-gamma, a nuclear receptor that promotes adipogenesis (Picard et al., Nature, (2004) 429, 771-776). In hepatocytes, Sirt1 regulates the gluconeogenic and glycolytic pathways in response to fasting by interacting with and deacetylating PGC-1α, a key transcriptional regulator of glucose production in the liver (Rodgers et al., Nature, (2005) 434, 113-118). Additionally, Sirt1 promotes insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells in response to high glucose partly by repressing Ucp2 expression and increasing cellular ATP levels (Moynihan et al., Cell Metab., (2005) 2, 105-117). While little is known about the regulation of NAD biosynthesis in mammals, NAD biosynthesis may play a role in the regulation of metabolic responses by altering the activity of certain NAD-dependent enzymes such as Sirt1 in a variety of organs and/or tissues.
The NAD biosynthesis pathways have been characterized in prokaryotes by using Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (Penfound and Foster, Biosynthesis and recycling of NAD, in Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology, p. 721-730, ed. Neidhardt, F. C., 1996, ASM Press: Washington, D.C.) and recently in yeast (Lin and Guarente, Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol., (2003) 15, 241-246; Denu, Trends Biochem. Sci., (2003) 28, 41-48). In prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, NAD is synthesized by the de novo pathway via quinolinic acid and by the salvage pathway via nicotinic acid (Penfound and Foster, id.) In yeast, the de novo pathway begins with tryptophan, which is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) through six enzymatic steps and one non-enzymatic reaction (Lin and Guarente, Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol., (2003) 15, 241-246). Two genes, BNA1 and QPT1, have been characterized in this pathway in yeast. At the step of NaMN synthesis, the de novo pathway converges with the salvage pathway. The salvage pathway begins with the breakdown of NAD into nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, which is mainly catalyzed by the Sir2 proteins in yeast. Nicotinamide is then deamidated to nicotinic acid by a nicotinamidase encoded by the PNC1 gene. Nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (Npt), encoded by the NPT1 gene, converts nicotinic acid to NaMN, which is eventually converted to NAD through the sequential reactions of nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (encoded by NMA1 and/or NMA2) and NAD synthetase (encoded by QNS1).
Many aspects of mammalian behavior and physiology are coordinated through interconnected networks of 24-hour central and peripheral oscillators that synchronize cycles of fuel storage and utilization to maintain organismal homeostasis. In mice, circadian disruption has been tied to metabolic disturbance (F. W. Turek et al., Science 308, 1043 (2005); R. D. Rudic et al., PLoS Biol. 2, e377 (2004)), while conversely, high-fat diet alters both behavioral and molecular rhythms (A. Kohsaka et al., Cell Metab. 6, 414 (2007); M. Barnea, Z. Madar, O. Froy, Endocrinology 150, 161 (2009)). The underlying mechanism of the mammalian clock consists of a transcription-translation feedback loop in which CLOCK and BMAL1 activate transcription of Cryptochrome (Cry 1 and 2) and Period (Per1, 2, and 3), leading to subsequent repression of CLOCK:BMAL1 by CRY and PER proteins (J. S. Takahashi, H. K. Hong, C. H. Ko, E. L. McDearmon, Nat. Rev. Genet. 9, 764 (2008)). An additional feedback loop involves the transcriptional regulation of Bmal1 by ROR□ and REV-ERB□ (N. Preitner et al., Cell 110, 251 (2002); T. K. Sato et al., Neuron 43, 527 (2004)). Previous studies have also implicated a role for cellular NAD+ in the regulation of CLOCK and NPAS2 activity (J. Rutter, M. Reick, L. C. Wu, S. L. McKnight, Science 293, 510 (2001)), an observation consistent with the recent finding that the NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 modulates activity of the clock complex (Y. Nakahata et al., Cell 134, 329 (2008); G. Asher et al., Cell 134, 317 (2008)).

U.S. application Ser. No. 11/053,185 describes methods and compositions for modulating the life span of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and for protecting cells against certain stresses, including modulating the flux of the NAD+ salvage pathway in the cell.

The term “blocking group” refers to a chemical group which exhibits the following characteristics. The “group” is derived from a “protecting compound.” Groups that are selective for primary hydroxyls over secondary hydroxyls that can be put on under conditions consistent with the stability of the phosphoramidate (pH 2-8) and impart on the resulting product substantially different physical properties allowing for an easier separation of the 3′-phosphoramidate-5′-new group product from the unreacted desired compound. The group must react selectively in good yield to give a protected substrate that is stable to the projected reactions (see Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed. T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., 1999). Examples of groups include, but are not limited to: benzoyl, acetyl, phenyl-substituted benzoyl, tetrahydropyranyl, trityl, DMT (4,4′-dimethoxytrityl), MMT (4-monomethoxytrityl), trimethoxytrityl, pixyl (9-phenylxanthen-9-yl), thiopixyl (9-phenylthioxanthen-9-yl) or 9-(p-methoxyphenyl)xanthine-9-yl (MOX), etc.; C(O)-alkyl, C(O)Ph, C(O)aryl, CH2O-alkyl, CH2O-aryl, SO2-alkyl, SO2-aryl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl.

Thus, for some illustrative non-restricting examples, the term pyridinyl includes pyridin-2-yl, pyridin-3-yl and pyridin-4-yl; or the term thienyl includes thien-2-yl and thien-3-yl.
The term “optionally substituted” means that the number of substituents can be equal to or different from zero. Unless otherwise indicated, it is possible that optionally substituted groups are substituted with as many optional substituents as can be accommodated by replacing a hydrogen atom with a non-hydrogen substituent on any available carbon or nitrogen atom. Commonly, it is possible for the number of optional substituents, when present, to be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, in particular 1, 2 or 3.
When groups in the compounds according to the invention are substituted, it is possible for said groups to be mono-substituted or poly-substituted with substituent(s), unless otherwise specified. Within the scope of the present invention, the meanings of all groups which occur repeatedly are independent from one another. It is possible that groups in the compounds according to the invention are substituted with one, two, three, four or five identical or different substituents, particularly with one, two or three substituents.
The compounds of the present invention furthermore optionally contain one or more asymmetric centrers, depending upon the location and nature of the various substituents desired. It is possible that one or more asymmetric carbon atoms are present in the (R) or (S) configuration, which can result in racemic mixtures in the case of a single asymmetric center, and in diastereomeric mixtures in the case of multiple asymmetric centers.
Preferred compounds are those which produce the more desirable biological activity. Separated, pure or partially purified isomers and stereoisomers or racemic or diastereomeric mixtures of the compounds of the present invention are also included within the scope of the present invention. The purification and the separation of such materials can be accomplished by standard techniques known in the art.
If only one diastereomer displays the desired biological activity, and a second disastereomer is inactive, the preferred isomer is the one which produces the more desirable biological activity. These separated, pure or partially purified isomers or racemic mixtures of the compounds of this invention are also included within the scope of the present invention. The purification and the separation of such materials can be accomplished by standard techniques known in the art.
The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes, for example, by the formation of diastereoisomeric salts using an optically active acid or base or formation of covalent diastereomers. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric, diacetyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid. Mixtures of diastereoisomers can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical and/or chemical differences by methods known in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The optically active bases or acids are then liberated from the separated diastereomeric salts. A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of chiral chromatography (e.g., HPLC columns using a chiral phase), with or without conventional derivatisation, optimally chosen to maximise the separation of the enantiomers. Suitable HPLC columns using a chiral phase are commercially available, such as those manufactured by Daicel, e.g., Chiracel OD and Chiracel OJ, for example, among many others, which are all routinely selectable. Enzymatic separations, with or without derivatisation, are also useful. The optically active compounds of the present invention can likewise be obtained by chiral syntheses utilizing optically active starting materials, enantioselective catalytic reactions, and other suitable methods.
In order to distinguish different types of isomers from each other reference is made to IUPAC Rules Section E (Pure Appl Chem 45, 11-30, 1976).
The present invention includes all possible stereoisomers of the compounds of the present invention as single stereoisomers, or as any mixture of said stereoisomers, in any ratio. Isolation of a single stereoisomer, e.g., a single enantiomer or a single diastereomer, of a compound of the present invention may be achieved by any suitable method, such as chromatography, especially chiral chromatography, for example.
Further, it is possible for the compounds of the present invention to exist as tautomers. For example, any compound of the present invention which contains an pyrazol moiety as a heteroaryl group for example can exist as a 1H tautomer, or a 2H tautomer, or even a mixture in any amount of the two tautomers, namely: The present invention includes all possible tautomers of the compounds of the present invention as single tautomers, or as any mixture of said tautomers, in any ratio.

Neurodegenerative Diseases
Axon degeneration occurs frequently in neurodegenerative diseases and peripheral neuropathies. The degeneration of transected axons is delayed in Wallerian degeneration slow (Wlds) mice with the overexpression of a fusion protein with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthetic enzyme, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat1). Both Wld(s) and Nmnat1 themselves are functional in preventing axon degeneration in neuronal cultures.
NAD+ levels decrease in injured, diseased, or degenerating neural cells and preventing this NAD+ decline efficiently protects neural cells from cell death. See, Araki & Milbrandt “Increased nuclear NAD+ biosynthesis and SIRT1 activation prevent axonal degeneration” Science. 2004 Aug. 13; 305(5686):1010-3 and Wang et al., “A local mechanism mediates NAD-dependent protection of axon degeneration” J Cell Biol. 170(3):349-55 (2005) hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. As the nicotinamide mononucleotide based compounds disclosed herein are capable of increasing intracellular levels of NAD+, these compounds are useful as a therapeutic or nutritional supplement in managing injuries, diseases, and disorders affecting the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, including, but not limited to, trauma or injury to neural cells, diseases or conditions that harm neural cells, and neurodegenerative diseases or syndromes. The correlation of increased NAD+ synthesis with beneficial outcomes in neural injuries and diseases or conditions has been discussed in, e.g., Stein et al., “Expression of Nampt in Hippocampal and Cortical Excitatory Neurons Is Critical for Cognitive Function” The Journal of Neuroscience 2014 34(17):5800-5815; and Stein et al., “Specific ablation of Nampt in adult neural stem cells recapitulates their functional defects during aging” EMBO J. 2014 33:1321-1340.
Some neurodegenerative diseases, neurodegenerative syndromes, diseases and conditions that harm neural cells, and injury to neural cells are described below.
Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder. It is a syndrome characterized by a slowly progressive postural and/or kinetic tremor, usually affecting both upper extremities.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with a loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain, strongly associated with advanced age. Over time, people with the disease lose their ability to think and reason clearly, judge situations, solve problems, concentrate, remember useful information, take care of themselves, and even speak. A number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease execute their biological impact in the brain. It is preferred that nicotinamide mononucleotide based compounds disclosed herein are capable of passing the blood-brain-barrier (BBB).
Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable, adult-onset, autosomal dominant inherited disorder associated with cell loss within a specific subset of neurons in the basal ganglia and cortex.
Ataxia is defined as an inability to maintain normal posture and smoothness of movement. Neurologic symptoms and signs such as seizures and movement disorders (e.g., dystonia, chorea) may accompany ataxia.
Catatonia is a state of apparent unresponsiveness to external stimuli in a person who is apparently awake.
Epilepsy is defined as a chronic condition characterized by spontaneous, recurrent seizures; seizure is defined as a clinical event associated with a transient, hypersynchronous neuronal discharge.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) refers to the combination of hyperthermia, rigidity, and autonomic dysregulation that can occur as a serious complication of the use of antipsychotic drugs.
Chorea is an involuntary abnormal movement, characterized by abrupt, brief, nonrhythmic, nonrepetitive movement of any limb, often associated with nonpatterned facial grimaces. Chorea gravidarum (CG) is the term given to chorea occurring during pregnancy.
Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration (CBGD) clinical characteristics include progressive dementia, parkinsonism, and limb apraxia. Dysfunction of the central or peripheral nervous system pathways may cause autonomic dysfunction.
Dystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions, usually producing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Writer's cramp is a form of task-specific focal dystonia.
Mental retardation (MR) is a condition in which intellectual capacity is limited significantly. Developmental disability describes a condition that limits an individual's ability to perform activities and roles as expected in a certain social environment. Frequently, MR and developmental disabilities are present simultaneously as a consequence of brain damage.
Neuroacanthocytosis is a progressive neurologic disease characterized by movement disorders, personality changes, cognitive deterioration, axonal neuropathy, and seizures. Most patients have acanthocytosis on peripheral blood smear at some point during the course of the disease.
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and X-linked spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2) are at opposite ends of a clinical spectrum of X-linked diseases caused by mutations of the same gene, the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene, and resulting in defective central nervous system (CNS) myelination. Clinical signs usually include some combination of nystagmus, stridor, spastic quadriparesis, hypotonia, cognitive impairment, ataxia, tremor, and diffuse leukoencephalopathy on MRI scans.
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), also known as Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, is a neurodegenerative disease that affects cognition, eye movements, and posture.
Striatonigral degeneration (SND) is a neurodegenerative disease that represents a manifestation of multiple system atrophy (MSA). The other manifestations are Shy-Drager syndrome (e.g., autonomic failure predominates) and sporadic olivopontocerebellar degeneration (sOPCA, cerebellum predominates).
Ischemic stroke occurs due to a loss of blood supply to part of the brain, initiating the ischemic cascade. Brain tissue ceases to function if deprived of oxygen for more than 60 to 90 seconds and after a few hours will suffer irreversible injury possibly leading to death of the tissue, i.e., infarction. Atherosclerosis may disrupt the blood supply by narrowing the lumen of blood vessels leading to a reduction of blood flow, by causing the formation of blood clots within the vessel, or by releasing showers of small emboli through the disintegration of atherosclerotic plaques. Embolic infarction occurs when emboli formed elsewhere in the circulatory system, typically in the heart as a consequence of atria fibrillation, or in the carotid arteries. These break off, enter the cerebral circulation, then lodge in and occlude brain blood vessels.
Due to collateral circulation within the region of brain tissue affected by ischemia, there is a spectrum of severity. Thus, part of the tissue may immediately die while other parts may only be injured and could potentially recover. The ischemia area where tissue might recover is referred to as the ischemic penumbra.
As oxygen or glucose becomes depleted in ischemic brain tissue, the production of high energy phosphate compounds such as adenine triphosphate (ATP) fails, leading to failure of energy dependent processes necessary for tissue cell survival. This sets off a series of interrelated events that result in cellular injury and death. These include the failure of mitochondria, which can lead further toward energy depletion and may trigger cell death due to apoptosis. Other processes include the loss of membrane ion pump function leading to electrolyte imbalances in brain cells. There is also the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, which have toxic effects in excessive concentrations.
Spinal cord injury, or myelopathy, is a disturbance of the spinal cord that results in loss of sensation and mobility. The two common types of spinal cord injury are: trauma: automobile accidents, falls, gunshots, diving accidents, etc. and disease: polio, spina bifida, tumors, Friedreich's ataxia, etc. It is important to note that the spinal cord does not have to be completely severed for there to be a loss of function. In fact, the spinal cord remains intact in most cases of spinal cord injury.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI), also called intracranial injury, or simply head injury, occurs when a sudden trauma causes brain damage. TBI can result from a closed head injury or a penetrating head injury and is one of two subsets of acquired brain injury (ABI). The other subset is non-traumatic brain injury (e.g., stroke, meningitis, anoxia). Parts of the brain that can be damaged include the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brain stem. Symptoms of a TBI can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the extent of the damage to the brain. Outcome can be anything from complete recovery to permanent disability or death. A coma can also affect a child's brain. The damage from TBI can be focal, confined to one area of the brain, or diffuse, involving more than one area of the brain. Diffuse trauma to the brain is frequently associated with concussion (a shaking of the brain in response to sudden motion of the head), diffuse axonal injury, or coma. Localized injuries may be associated with neurobehavioral manifestations, hemiparesis or other focal neurologic deficits.
Another insult to the brain that can cause injury is anoxia. Anoxia is a condition in which there is an absence of oxygen supply to an organ's tissues, even if there is adequate blood flow to the tissue. Hypoxia refers to a decrease in oxygen supply rather than a complete absence of oxygen, and ischemia is inadequate blood supply, as is seen in cases in which the brain swells. In any of these cases, without adequate oxygen, a biochemical cascade called the ischemic cascade is unleashed, and the cells of the brain can die within several minutes. This type of injury is often seen in near-drowning victims, in heart attack patients (particularly those who have suffered a cardiac arrest), or in people who suffer significant blood loss from other injuries that then causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain due to circulatory (hypovolemic) shock.
Regulating Blood Glucose Concentration
Provided herein is a process for regulating the concentration of blood glucose in a mammal. As utilized herein, regulating the concentration of blood glucose refers to any increase, decrease, and/or maintenance in or of the concentration of blood glucose as compared to a previously determined level.
Compounds of the present invention may be administered to a mammal in need of such treatment. For example, the mammal may require an increase in blood glucose concentration. Alternatively, the mammal may require a decrease in blood glucose concentration. Or, the mammal may require maintenance of blood glucose concentration above, at, or below a particular level or within a particular range (e.g., through a series of increases and/or decreases, or through no increases or decreases). The blood glucose concentration-regulating compounds may also be administered to a mammal as a prophylactic measure; that is, the mammal is in need of treatment to prevent or delay the occurrence or onset of a medical condition such as, for example, type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
The ability to regulate the concentration of blood glucose in a mammal according to the processes described herein (e.g., by administering to a mammal a blood glucose regulating amount of a compound of the present invention may be advantageous in the treatment and/or prevention of a variety of complications, diseases, and/or illnesses. The role of increased NAD+ levels on metabolic diseases and conditions has been described in, for example, Yoshino et al., “Nicotinamide mononucleotide, a key NAD+ intermediate, treats the pathophysiology of diet- and age-induced diabetes” Cell Metab. 2011 14:528-536; and Garten, et al., “Nampt: Linking NAD biology, metabolism, and cancer” Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2009 20(3):130-138. In general, the present invention may be utilized to treat a variety of acute, intermediate stage, and chronic conditions that may be affected by systemic NAD biosynthesis either directly or indirectly.
For example, the regulation of blood glucose concentration may be effective in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of such medical conditions as brain ischemia-induced hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic brain injury caused by, e.g., congenital hyperinsulinism in children, and/or other conditions that severely reduce blood glucose levels. Alternatively, the regulation of blood glucose concentration may be effective in counteracting the effects of the injection of an excessive amount of insulin, or an insufficient dietary or vitamin intake (e.g., deficiencies in vitamin B3 (niacin, which is derived from nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) can result in pellagra, the classic niacin deficiency disease, characterized by bilateral dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia).
Further, regulation of blood glucose concentration may be effective in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
The regulation of blood glucose concentration according to the methods described herein may also be advantageous in counteracting the effects of blood glucose concentration-decreasing drugs such as acetaminophen, alcohol, anabolic steroids, clofibrate, disopyramide, gemfibrozil, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), pentamidine, or sulfonylurea medications (such as glipizide, glyburide, and glimepiride).
Other conditions having a plausible connection to NAD biosynthesis, such as dementia, may also be beneficially treated and/or prevented by blood glucose regulation. See, e.g., Guest, et al., “Changes in Oxidative Damage, Inflammation and [NAD(H)] with Age in Cerebrospinal Fluid” PLOS One. January 2014 9(1): e85335.
The increase, decrease, and/or maintenance of blood glucose concentration can be quantified, for example, by percentage above, below, or in between one or more previously determined levels, or can be quantified by a particular blood glucose concentration or a range thereof.
For example, the blood glucose concentration may be increased to at least about 5% above a previously determined level; to at least about 10% above a previously determined level; to at least about 25% above a previously determined level; to at least about 50% above a previously determined level; to at least about 75% above a previously determined level; to at least about 100% above a previously determined level; to at least about 150% above a previously determined level; or to at least about 200% above a previously determined level. By way of another example, the blood glucose concentration may be decreased to at least about 5% below a previously determined level; to at least about 10% below a previously determined level; to at least about 25% below a previously determined level; to at least about 50% below a previously determined level; to at least about 75% below a previously determined level; to at least about 100% below a previously determined level; to at least about 150% below a previously determined level; or to at least about 200% below a previously determined level. By way of yet another example, the blood glucose concentration may be maintained (e.g., by a series of increases and/or decreases, or by no increases and/or decreases) at a concentration that is no more than about 50% greater or about 50% less than a previously determined level; e.g., no more than about 40% greater or about 40% less; no more than about 30% greater or about 30% less; no more than about 20% greater or about 20% less; no more than about 10% greater or about 10% less; or no more than about 5% greater or about 5% less.
Alternatively, the blood glucose concentration may be maintained (e.g., by a series of increases and/or decreases, or by no increases and/or decreases) at, above, or below a particular blood glucose concentration or within a desired range of blood glucose concentrations. For example, the blood glucose concentration may be maintained at a concentration of greater than about 60 mg/dL; greater than about 70 mg/dL; greater than about 100 mg/dL; greater than about 110 mg/dL; or greater than about 125 mg/dL. Alternatively, the blood glucose concentration may be maintained at a concentration of less than about 200 mg/dL; less than about 175 mg/dL; less than about 150 mg/dL; less than about 125 mg/dL; less than about 110 mg/dL; or less than about 100 mg/dL. By way of another example, the blood glucose concentration may be maintained at a concentration of from about 60 mg/dL to about 140 mg/dL; from about 90 mg/dL to about 130 mg/dL; from about 100 mg/dL to about 125 mg/dL; or from about 110 mg/dL to about 125 mg/dL.
Drug Toxicity
In some embodiments, the invention relates to the use of a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative to prevent adverse effects and protect cells from toxicity. Toxicity may be an adverse effect of radiation or external chemicals on the cells of the body. Examples of toxins are pharmaceuticals, drugs of abuse, and radiation, such as UV or X-ray light. Both radiative and chemical toxins have the potential to damage biological molecules such as DNA. This damage typically occurs by chemical reaction of the exogenous agent or its metabolites with biological molecules, or indirectly through stimulated production of reactive oxygen species (e.g., superoxide, peroxides, hydroxyl radicals). Repair systems in the cell excise and repair damage caused by toxins.
Enzymes that use NAD+ play a part in the DNA repair process. Specifically, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), particularly PARP-1, are activated by DNA strand breaks and affect DNA repair. The PARPs consume NAD+ as an adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) donor and synthesize poly(ADP-ribose) onto nuclear proteins such as histones and PARP itself. Although PARP activities facilitate DNA repair, overactivation of PARP can cause significant depletion of cellular NAD+, leading to cellular necrosis. The apparent sensitivity of NAD+ metabolism to genotoxicity has led to pharmacological investigations into the inhibition of PARP as a means to improve cell survival. Numerous reports have shown that PARP inhibition increases NAD+ concentrations in cells subject to genotoxicity, with a resulting decrease in cellular necrosis.
See, e.g., Fang, et al., Defective Mitophagy in XPA via PARP-1 Hyperactivation and NAD+/SIRT1 Reduction. Cell 2014 157:882-896. Nevertheless, cell death from toxicity still occurs, presumably because cells are able to complete apoptotic pathways that are activated by genotoxicity. Thus, significant cell death is still a consequence of DNA/macromolecule damage, even with inhibition of PARP. This consequence suggests that improvement of NAD+ metabolism in genotoxicity can be partially effective in improving cell survival but that other proteins that modulate apoptotic sensitivity, such as sirtuins, may also play important roles in cell responses to genotoxins.
Physiological and biochemical mechanisms that determine the effects of chemical and radiation toxicity in tissues are complex, and evidence indicates that NAD+ metabolism is an important aspect of cell stress response pathways. For example, upregulation of NAD+ metabolism, via nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NMNAT) overexpression, has been shown to protect against neuron axonal degeneration, and nicotinamide used pharmacologically has been recently shown to provide neuron protection in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal ischemia. Such protective effects could be attributable to upregulated NAD+ biosynthesis, which increases the available NAD+ pool subject to depletion during genotoxic stress. This depletion of NAD+ is mediated by PARP enzymes, which are activated by DNA damage and can deplete cellular NAD+, leading to necrotic death. Another mechanism of enhanced cell protection that could act in concert with upregulated NAD+ biosynthesis is the activation of cell protection transcriptional programs regulated by sirtuin enzymes.
Aging/Stress
In certain embodiments, the invention provides a method extending the lifespan of a cell, extending the proliferative capacity of a cell, slowing aging of a cell, promoting the survival of a cell, delaying cellular senescence in a cell, mimicking the effects of calorie restriction, increasing the resistance of a cell to stress, or preventing apoptosis of a cell, by contacting the cell with a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound. Recent studies have demonstrated the role NAD+ plays in the aging process and in age-related diseases and conditions. See, e.g., Imai, et al., “NAD+ and sirtuins in aging and disease” Trends in Cell Biol. 2014 24(8): 464-471; and Gomes, et al. “Declining NAD+ Induces a Pseudohypoxic State Disrupting Nuclear-Mitochondrial Communication during Aging” Cell 2013 155:1624-1638.
The methods described herein may be used to increase the amount of time that cells, particularly primary cells (e.g., cells obtained from an organism, e.g., a human), may be kept alive in an ex vivo cell culture. Embryonic stem (ES) cells and pluripotent cells, and cells differentiated therefrom, may also be treated with a nicotinamide mononucleotide based or derivative compound to keep the cells, or progeny thereof, in culture for longer periods of time. Such cells can also be used for transplantation into a subject, e.g., after ex vivo modification.
In certain embodiments, cells that are intended to be preserved for long periods of time may be treated with a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound. The cells may be in suspension (e.g., blood cells, serum, biological growth media, etc.) or in tissues or organs in a subject. For example, blood collected from an individual for purposes of transfusion may be treated with a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound to preserve the blood cells for longer periods of time. Additionally, blood to be used for forensic purposes may also be preserved using a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound. Other cells that may be treated to extend their lifespan or protect against apoptosis include cells for consumption, e.g., cells from non-human mammals (such as meat) or plant cells (such as vegetables).
Nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compounds may also be applied during developmental and growth phases in mammals, plants, insects or microorganisms, in order to, e.g., alter, retard or accelerate the developmental and/or growth process.
In certain embodiments, nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compounds may be used to treat cells useful for transplantation or cell therapy, including, for example, solid tissue grafts, organ transplants, cell suspensions, stem cells, bone marrow cells, etc. The cells or tissue may be an autograft, an allograft, a syngraft or a xenograft. The cells or tissue may be treated with the nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound prior to administration/implantation, concurrently with administration/implantation, and/or post administration/implantation into a subject. The cells or tissue may be treated prior to removal of the cells from the donor individual, ex vivo after removal of the cells or tissue from the donor individual, or post implantation into the recipient. For example, the donor or recipient individual may be treated systemically with a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound or may have a subset of cells/tissue treated locally with a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound. In certain embodiments, the cells or tissue (or donor/recipient individuals) may additionally be treated with another therapeutic agent useful for prolonging graft survival, such as, for example, an immunosuppressive agent, a cytokine, an angiogenic factor, etc.
In certain embodiments, cells may be treated with a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of NAD+ in vivo, e.g., to increase their lifespan or prevent apoptosis. For example, skin can be protected from aging (e.g., developing wrinkles, loss of elasticity, etc.) by treating skin or epithelial cells with a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of intracellular NAD+. In exemplary embodiments, skin is contacted with a pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition comprising a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of intracellular NAD+. Exemplary skin afflictions or skin conditions that may be treated in accordance with the methods described herein include disorders or diseases associated with or caused by inflammation, sun damage or natural aging. For example, the compositions find utility in the prevention or treatment of contact dermatitis (including irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis), atopic dermatitis (also known as allergic eczema), actinic keratosis, keratinization disorders (including eczema), epidermolysis bullosa diseases (including penfigus), exfoliative dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, erythemas (including erythema multiforme and erythema nodosum), damage caused by the sun or other light sources, discoid lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, psoriasis, skin cancer and the effects of natural aging. In other embodiments, a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of intracellular NAD+ may be used for the treatment of wounds and/or burns to promote healing, including, for example, first-, second- or third-degree burns and/or thermal, chemical or electrical burns. The formulations may be administered topically, to the skin or mucosal tissue, as an ointment, lotion, cream, microemulsion, gel, solution or the like, as further described herein, within the context of a dosing regimen effective to bring about the desired result.
Topical formulations comprising one or more nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compounds that increase the level of intracellular NAD+ may also be used as preventive, e.g., chemopreventive, compositions. When used in a chemopreventive method, susceptible skin is treated prior to any visible condition in a particular individual.
In certain embodiments, a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of intracellular NAD+ may be used for treating or preventing a disease or condition induced or exacerbated by cellular senescence in a subject; methods for decreasing the rate of senescence of a subject, e.g., after onset of senescence; methods for extending the lifespan of a subject; methods for treating or preventing a disease or condition relating to lifespan; methods for treating or preventing a disease or condition relating to the proliferative capacity of cells; and methods for treating or preventing a disease or condition resulting from cell damage or death. In certain embodiments, the method does not act by decreasing the rate of occurrence of diseases that shorten the lifespan of a subject. In certain embodiments, a method does not act by reducing the lethality caused by a disease, such as cancer.
In certain embodiments, a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of intracellular NAD+ may be administered to a subject in order to generally increase the lifespan of its cells and to protect its cells against stress and/or against apoptosis. Treating a subject with a compound described herein may be similar to subjecting the subject to hormesis, i.e., mild stress that is beneficial to organisms and may extend their lifespan.
A nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of intracellular NAD+ can also be administered to subjects for treatment of diseases, e.g., chronic diseases, associated with cell death, in order to protect the cells from cell death.

Cell death can also be caused by surgery, drug therapy, chemical exposure or radiation exposure.
A nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of intracellular NAD+ can also be administered to a subject suffering from an acute disease, e.g., damage to an organ or tissue, e.g., a subject suffering from stroke or myocardial infarction or a subject suffering from a spinal cord injury. A nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of intracellular NAD+ may also be used to repair an alcoholic's liver.
Cardiovascular Disease
In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods for treating and/or preventing a cardiovascular disease by administering to a subject in need thereof a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of intracellular NAD+. The benefits of NAD+ in treating cardiovascular diseases has been described in several studies, such as Borradaile, et al., “NAD+, Sirtuins, and Cardiovascular Disease” Current Pharmaceutical Design 2016 15(1):110-117.
Cardiovascular diseases that can be treated or prevented by a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of intracellular NAD+ include cardiomyopathy or myocarditis; such as idiopathic cardiomyopathy, metabolic cardiomyopathy, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, drug-induced cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hypertensive cardiomyopathy. Also treatable or preventable using compounds and methods described herein are atheromatous disorders of the major blood vessels (macrovascular disease) such as the aorta, the coronary arteries, the carotid arteries, the cerebrovascular arteries, the renal arteries, the iliac arteries, the femoral arteries, and the popliteal arteries. Other vascular diseases that can be treated or prevented include those related to platelet aggregation, the retinal arterioles, the glomerular arterioles, the vasa nervorum, cardiac arterioles, and associated capillary beds of the eye, the kidney, the heart, and the central and peripheral nervous systems.
Yet other disorders that may be treated with a nicotinamide mononucleotide based derivative compound that increases the level of intracellular NAD+ include restenosis, e.g., following coronary intervention, and disorders relating to an abnormal level of high density and low density cholesterol.
Circadian Rhythm
The circadian clock is encoded by a transcription-translation feedback loop that synchronizes behavior and metabolism with the light-dark cycle. It has been unexpectedly discovered that both the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), and levels of NAD+, display circadian oscillations which are regulated by the core clock machinery in mice. Inhibition of NAMPT promotes oscillation of the clock gene Per2 by releasing CLOCK:BMAL1 from suppression by SIRT1. In turn, the circadian transcription factor CLOCK binds to and up-regulates Nampt, thus completing a feedback loop involving NAMPT/NAD+ and SIRT1/CLOCK:BMAL1. See, e.g., Ramsey et al., “Circadian clock feedback cycle through NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis” Science 2009 324:651-654.
Thus, the periodic variation in NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis suggests that it impacts physiologic cycles and possibly the sleep-wake and fasting-feeding cycle. Without being bound by a single theory, it is believed that NAD+ serves as a critical “metabolic oscillator” for the rhythmic regulation of response to environmental cues through control of SIRT1 activity. Compounds disclosed herein may be used to affect a circadian feedback loop through NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis and/or a pathway underlying the temporal coupling of metabolic, physiologic, and circadian cycles in mammals.
The recognition of a regulatory pathway involving NAMPT/NAD+-SIRT1/CLOCK:BMAL1 has broad implications for understanding how physiologic and behavioral cycles are coordinated with the environmental light-dark cycle. For instance, during sleep, when animals are normally quiescent and fasting, the levels of NAMPT steadily increase, peaking at the beginning of the wakefulness period and coinciding with feeding. As a result of the increase in NAMPT, NAD+ rises to stimulate SIRT1, which orchestrates an appropriate metabolic response in liver involving a switch from catabolic to anabolic pathways.
In certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods for regulation of the core clock machinery (sometimes also referred to as the circadian clock) of a mammal, thereby affecting behaviors, activities, and/or biological functions that occur in or are affected by a diurnal or circadian cycle and that are regulated, at least in part, by the circadian clock. Generally, the methods involve the administration of a therapeutic or prophylactic amount of a circadian clock-regulating compound to a patient or mammal in need of regulation of the circadian clock.
The methods of treatment disclosed herein are generally directed to methods of regulating the circadian clock, thereby regulating or affecting biological functions that are regulated by (sometimes also said to be affected by, affiliated with, or mediated by) the activity of the circadian clock. Typically, these biological functions display a pattern of activity and inactivity that is generally repeated approximately every 24 hours, oscillating between “active” and “inactive” states during the 24 hour period.
Thus, the present invention provides methods of regulating the activity of the circadian clock by administering to a mammal in need thereof a circadian-clock regulating compound. Generally, the regulation of the activity of the circadian clock is the result of the regulation of CLOCK:BMAL1, which is achieved according to the present methods by regulating the activity of SIRT1. The activity of SIRT1 is generally regulated according to the present methods by administration of a circadian clock-regulating compound, and in certain embodiments, by administration of a compound that affects the NAD+ pathway. The regulation of the circadian clock thereby permits regulation of activities mediated by the circadian clock.
According to the present invention, the activity of the circadian clock may be increased, decreased, or maintained by the administration of a circadian clock-regulating compound. Accordingly, biological functions (sometimes also referred to as biological activities) that are regulated by the activity of the circadian clock may also be increased, decreased, or maintained. In addition, these biological functions may also be time shifted; that is to say, an activity that typically occurs during a particular period, such as for example, during daytime or daylight hours (sometimes also referred to as the light cycle) or during the night or nighttime hours (sometimes also referred to as the dark cycle) may be shifted such that the activity occurs during the dark or light cycle, respectively, instead.
Any of a number of biological functions that are typically affected by the activity of the circadian clock may be regulated by the methods of the present invention. Thus, the present methods may be used to treat disorders or disease states that are the result of, for example, the irregular, inadequate, or pathological function of the circadian clock. Similarly, the present methods may be used to treat disorders or symptomatology caused by exogenous factors that affect the proper function or activity of the circadian clock or that require a “resetting” of the clock. For example, administration of circadian clock-regulating compound to a patient experiencing a metabolic disorder provides therapeutic benefit not only when the patient's serum NMN or NAD level is increased, but also when an improvement is observed in the patient with respect to other disorders that accompany the metabolic disorder, like weight loss or gain. In some treatment regimens, the circadian clock-regulating compound of the invention may be administered to a patient at risk of developing a disorder as described herein or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of such a disorder, even though a diagnosis of a metabolic disorder may not have been made.
Examples of disorders, disease states, or symptomatology that may be treated according to the methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, travel to or across one or more time zones, a change in work shifts, night shift work, or a change in the physical status of a mammal caused by, for example, pregnancy or administration of medications of any kind. Accordingly, the methods of the present invention may be used to treat or prevent disorders, symptoms of disorders, or symptoms caused by exogenous factors. Such disorders and symptoms may include, for example, metabolic disorders, such as improper cycling or timing of feeding and fasting cycles, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or diabetes; sleep disorders, such as insomnia, advanced sleep phase syndrome, delayed sleep phase syndrome, inconsistent sleep/wake cycles, or narcolepsy or to improve wakefulness in individuals suffering from excessive sleepiness; and symptoms caused by exogenous factors, such as, travel to or across one or more time zones (jet lag), shifting into or out of daylight savings time, a change in work shifts or night shift work, pregnancy, or medications being taken for unrelated diseases or disorders.
Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to a method of regulating a biological function in a mammal, the function being affected by the circadian clock. The method comprises administering a therapeutic or prophylactic (sometimes also referred to as a circadian clock-regulating) amount of a circadian clock-regulating compound to the mammal. The biological function can be, for example, any one of the biological functions described herein. In certain embodiments, the invention comprises a method of treating a metabolic disorder in a mammal and comprises administering a therapeutic or prophylactic amount of a circadian clock-regulating compound to the mammal. In other embodiments, the invention comprises a method of treating a disorder in a mammal mediated by the function of the circadian clock and comprises administering a therapeutic or prophylactic amount of a circadian clock-regulating compound to the mammal. According to any one of these embodiments, the circadian clock-regulating compound may be, for example, nicotinamide, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD); salts and prodrugs thereof; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT); and combinations thereof, as described in greater detail below. In other embodiments, the circadian clock-regulating compound may be an antagonist of any one of the compounds listed above, thereby exacting an effect opposite that of nicotinamide, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD); salts and prodrugs thereof; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT); and combinations thereof.
In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to a method of regulating metabolic activity of a mammal comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutic amount of a circadian clock-regulating compound. In certain embodiments, the metabolic activity of the mammal is increased. In other embodiments, the metabolic activity is decreased. In yet other embodiments, the metabolic activity of the mammal is maintained at a desired level, thereby preventing fluctuations in activity/inactivity. In still other embodiments, the metabolic activity is caused to occur in the light cycle (as opposed to its typical occurrence in the dark cycle). In other embodiments, the metabolic activity is caused to occur in the dark cycle (as opposed to its typical occurrence in the light cycle). In certain embodiments, the circadian clock-regulating compound is administered to the mammal in order to increase the anabolic activity of the liver (e.g., increase the activity of the metabolic pathways of the liver or shift or switch liver activity from catabolism to anabolism). In other embodiments, the circadian clock-regulating compound is administered to the mammal in order to increase the catabolic activity of the liver (e.g., decrease the activity of the metabolic process).
Mitochondrial Diseases and Metabolic Effects
In addition to regulating circadian rhythms and protect neural cells from cell death, sirtuins such as SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 are found in mitochondria. SIRT3 is expressed at high levels in metabolically active tissue. Modulation of SIRT3 has a variety of physiological applications for muscle cells including mimicking calorie restriction or exercise, increasing mitochodrial biogenesis or metabolism, sensitizing a cell to glucose uptake, increasing fatty acid oxidation, and decreasing reactive oxygen species. In addition, SIRT3 is demonstrated herein to be involved in promoting cell survival during genotoxic stress. Thus modulation of SIRT3 levels also has applications in mediating cell survival.
Increasing the protein or activity level of SIRT3 in a muscle cell can mimic the benefits of calorie restriction or exercise. In some embodiments, the invention relates to methods for increasing mitochondrial biogenesis or metabolism or for boosting mitochondrial activity/endurance in a muscle cell by contacting a muscle cell with an agent IS that increases the protein or activity level of SIRT3 in the cell. In some embodiments, the invention relates to methods for sensitizing a muscle cell to glucose uptake by contacting a muscle cell with an agent that increases the protein or activity level of SIRT3 in the cell. Further embodiments of the invention relate to methods for increasing fatty acid oxidation in a muscle cell by contacting a muscle cell with an agent that increases the protein or activity level of SIRT3 in the cell. Some embodiments of the invention relate to methods for decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a muscle cell by contacting the muscle cell with an agent that increases the protein or activity level of SIRT3 in the cell.
Increasing levels of SIRT3 benefits many diseases and disorders affected by metabolism within mitochondria. Increasing SIRT3 may be useful in any subjects in need of metabolic activation of one or more of their muscles, e.g., smooth muscles or cardiac muscles or muscle cells thereof. A subject may be a subject having cachexia or muscle wasting.
Increasing SIRT3 may also be used to increase or maintain body temperature, e.g., in hypothermic subjects. Alternatively, inhibiting SIRT3 may be used to reduce body temperature, e.g., in subjects having fever or hyperthermia.
Generally, activation of SIRT3 may be used to stimulate the metabolism of any type of muscle, e.g., muscles of the gut or digestive system, or the urinary tract, and thereby may be used to control gut motility, e.g., constipation, and incontinence.
Other embodiments in which it would be useful to increase SIRT3 include repair of muscle, such as after a surgery or an accident, increase of muscle mass; and increase of athletic performance.
Thus the invention provides methods in which beneficial effects are produced by contacting one or more muscle cells with an agent that increases the protein or activity level of SIRT3 in the cell. These methods effectively facilitate, increase or stimulate one or more of the following: mimic the benefits of calorie restriction or exercise in the muscle cell, increase mitochondrial biogenesis or metabolism, increase mitochondrial activity and/or endurance in the muscle cell, sensitize the muscle cell to glucose uptake, increase fatty acid oxidation in the muscle cell, decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the muscle cell, increase PGC-1a and/or ucp3 and/or GLUT4 expression in the muscle cell, and activate AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the muscle cell.
Various types of muscle cells can be contacted in accordance with the invention. In some embodiments, the muscle cell is a skeletal muscle cell. In certain embodiments, the muscle cell is a cell of a slow-twitch muscle, such as a soleus muscle cell. The methods of the invention include, in some embodiments, administering, to a subject in need of such treatment, an agent that increases the protein or activity level of SIRT3 in cells of the subject.
The cell that is contacted or the subject that is treated in the aforementioned methods preferably is a cell in need of SIRT3 increase in protein or activity level. In certain embodiments, the cell is a diseased cell of a subject.
Also provided are methods for regulating skeletal muscle metabolism or skeletal muscle energy homeostasis in a subject. In such methods, an agent that modulates the protein or activity level of SIRT3 in the subject, i.e., the SIRT3 modulators described herein, is administered to a subject in need thereof.
Also provided are methods for increasing the protein level of SIRT3 in a muscle cell or in muscles of a subject. Such methods include subjecting a cell or a subject to caloric restriction or fasting, or administering to a subject in need thereof an agent that increases the protein or activity level of SIRT3 in a muscle cell. Diseases, disorders and conditions in which such methods are useful include mitochondrial diseases, metabolic disorders, neurologic disorders, muscular disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and excessive weight or obesity. Specific metabolic disorders, diseases or conditions include insulin resistance, diabetes, diabetes related conditions or disorders, endothelial dysfunction, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis (NASH), or metabolic syndrome. Other metabolic disorders will be known to the skilled person.
Mitochondrial diseases that can be treated include diseases that show a variety of symptoms caused by dysfunction of mitochondria in cells. The mitochondrial diseases may be classified in various ways by biochemical abnormalities, clinical symptoms or types of DNA abnormalities. Types named as KSS (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia), MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibers; Fukuhara syndrome), MELAS, Leber's disease, Leigh encephalopathia and Pearson's disease are widely known. Among them, MELAS is a type mainly showing stroke-like episodes, occupies 30% or more of the whole and is believed to be the most frequent type in the mitochondrial disease.
Retinal Diseases and Disorders
Photoreceptor neuronal cell death and vision can be rescued by NMN administration. In certain embodiments, nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT)-mediated NAD biosynthesis can play a role in for rod and/or cone PR neuron survival. In certain embodiments, decreased NAD levels can cause impaired mitochondrial function in PR neurons, alterations in TCA cycle metabolites, and can lead to cell death and blindness.
Deleting NAMPT can lead to photoreceptor death, loss of normal retinal structure and function, and vision loss. In some cases, damage to photoreceptor neurons and their function can be reversed with supplementation of NMN, an NAMPT enzymatic reaction product. Disclosed herein are methods of administering NMN to restore NAD levels in the retina. In some embodiments, NMN supplementation can be an effective therapeutic intervention for many retinal degenerative diseases.

Pharmaceutical Formulations
The compounds of this invention are formulated with conventional carriers and excipients, which can be selected in accord with ordinary practice. Tablets can contain excipients, glidants, fillers, binders and the like. Aqueous formulations are prepared in sterile form, and when intended for delivery by other than oral administration generally will be isotonic. All formulations will optionally contain excipients such as those set forth in the “Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients” (1986). Excipients include ascorbic acid and other antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA, carbohydrates such as dextran, hydroxyalkylcellulose, hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose, stearic acid and the like. The pH of the formulations can range from about 3 to about 11, but is ordinarily about 7 to about 10.
While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone, it may be preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use, of the invention comprise at least one active ingredient, as above defined, together with one or more acceptable carriers therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and physiologically innocuous to the recipient thereof.
The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.
A tablet is made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom.
For infections of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, about 0.075 to about 20% w/w (including active ingredient(s) in a range between about 0.1% and about 20% in increments of about 0.1% w/w such as about 0.6% w/w, about 0.7% w/w, etc.), preferably about 0.2 to about 15% w/w and most preferably about 0.5 to about 10% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.
If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least about 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulphoxide and related analogs.
The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.
Emulgents and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include Tween™ 60, Span™ 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.
The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties. The cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils are used.
Pharmaceutical formulations according to the present invention comprise a compound according to the invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients and optionally other therapeutic agents. Pharmaceutical formulations containing the active ingredient may be in any form suitable for the intended method of administration. When intended for oral use for example, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions, and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation.

These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques, including microencapsulation, to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.
Formulations for oral use may be also presented as hard gelatin capsules where the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.

Oil suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oral suspensions may contain a thickening agent, such as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents, such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid.
Dispersible powders and granules of the invention suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent, and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those disclosed above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil, a mineral oil, such as liquid paraffin, or a mixture of these. Suitable emulsifying agents include naturally-occurring gums, such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth; naturally-occurring phosphatides, such as soybean lecithin; esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids; hexitol anhydrides, such as sorbitan monooleate; and condensation products of these partial esters with ethylene oxide, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the subject treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain approximately 1 to approximately 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5% to about 95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to about 500 μg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL/hr can occur.
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of about 0.5 to about 20%, advantageously about 0.5 to about 10%, and particularly about 1.5% w/w.
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.
Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for example in the range of about 0.1 to about 500 microns, such as about 0.5, about 1, about 30, or about 35 microns etc., which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents.
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.
The formulations are presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.
The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefor.
Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired route.
Compounds of the invention are used to provide controlled release pharmaceutical formulations containing as active ingredient one or more compounds of the invention (“controlled release formulations”) in which the release of the active ingredient are controlled and regulated to allow less frequent dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile of a given active ingredient.
An effective dose of an active ingredient depends at least on the nature of the condition being treated, toxicity, whether the compound is being used prophylactically (lower doses) or against an active disease or disorder, the method of delivery, and the pharmaceutical formulation, and will be determined by the clinician using conventional dose escalation studies. It can be expected to be from about 0.0001 to about 100 mg/kg body weight per day; typically, from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day; more typically, from about 0.01 to about 5 mg/kg body weight per day; most typically, from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day. For example, the daily candidate dose for an adult human of approximately 70 kg body weight will range from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, preferably between about 5 mg and about 500 mg, and may take the form of single or multiple doses.
Routes of Administration
One or more compounds of the invention (herein referred to as the active ingredients) are administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), and the like. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with, for example, the condition of the recipient. An advantage of the compounds of this invention is that they are orally bioavailable and can be dosed orally.

Example 1A: (3-carbamoyl-1-(6-(hydroxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyltetrahydrofuro[3,4-d][1,3]dioxol-4-yl)pyridin-1-ium triflate salt)
A 500 mL 3-necked flask, under nitrogen, was charged with 110 mL ACN. The solvent was cooled on ice to 0-5° C. and treated with 1.2 mL sulfuric acid. After 5 minutes, the solution was treated with 28 gm (269 mmol) 2,2-dimethoxypropane. Next, the solution was treated with 13.65 gm (33.7 mmol) nicotinamide riboside triflate salt (Sauve et al., WO 2007/061798) and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and monitored by LC. After 20 minutes, the dark solution was cooled on an ice-water bath and treated with 2.73 gm (25.7 mmol) sodium carbonate and 5 mL water. After stirring for 20 minutes, the mixture was filtered to remove any remaining solid carbonate, and the filtrate evaporated to afford 19 gm as a dark red foam. The bulk sample was dissolved in 200 mL MeOH and treated, while stirred, with 50 mL water. At this concentration, the completely dissolved material became a bit turbid. The mixture was treated with 45 gm charcoal and allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours. The mixture was filtered through Celite, which was washed with MeOH and the filtrate evaporated to produce a turbid liquid. The liquid was diluted with ˜30 mL ACN until a clear solution was obtained, which was frozen and lyophilized to afford 11.4 gm 3-carbamoyl-1-(6-(hydroxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyltetrahydrofuro[3,4-d][1,3]dioxol-4-yl)pyridin-1-ium triflate salt, as a pale yellow solid (76%).

Example 19: 3-Carbamoyl-1-(5-(((diethoxyphosphoryl)oxy)methyl)-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydro furan-2-yl)pyridin-1-ium Chloride (Compound 19)
Nicotinamide Riboside Triflate salt (1.3 g, 3.22 mmoles) was placed into a 10 ml single necked round bottomed flask under N2. Freshly distilled trimethyl phosphate (2.6 ml) was added via syringe and this was stirred until a solution formed (15 min). This solution was placed under vacuum for 15 minutes to remove volatiles then placed under N2. The solution was cooled in an ice-water bath for 10 minutes then phosphorous oxychloride (1.30 ml, 2.14 g, 13.8 mmols, 4.3 equivalents) was added dropwise over 10 minutes. The reaction was stirred at 0° C. for 1 hour, placed into a 4° C. refrigerator and allowed to react overnight. The reaction was checked by HPLC for completeness and then placed into an ice-water bath and ethanol (5.0 ml, 3.95 gm, 85.6 mmoles, 26.6 equivalents) was added dropwise over 6 minutes. The reaction was removed from the cold bath and it was allowed to warm to room temperature for 4 hours. At this time, the reaction was added dropwise to a well stirred solution of diethyl ether (100 ml). The stirring was stopped and the upper layer decanted off. The heavy oil was dissolved in a minimum of ethanol and added dropwise to well-stirred diethyl ether. The stirring was stopped and the ether layer decanted. The resulting heavy oil was placed under vacuum and the resulting foam was purified using a silica gel preparative chromatography plate using 7:3:0.5 DCM:MeOH:formic acid. This gave 0.760 g of a clear oil, which still contained a small amount of trimethyl phosphate, but which was identified as diethyl NMN by HPLC/MS, 1H and 31P NMR.

Example 23: Biological Assays for Determining Levels of NAD+
As the compounds disclosed herein can act as prodrugs for NMN, their biological activity was assessed in vivo by measuring the ability to elevate NAD+ levels in liver and skeletal muscle. These tissues were selected for pharmacodynamics studies due to their relevance for the treatment of metabolic diseases. In general, C57/BL6 mice were fasted from 16 hours, then administered a 500 mg/ml oral dose of a disclosed compound in PBS buffer by oral gavage. In some cases, the dose was 250 mg/kg or in an alternate vehicle: ethanol/PBS/PEG400 (10/30/60). After dosing, the mice were sacrificed at pre-set time points after dosing (generally 4, 8 and 24 hours). The liver and skeletal tissues were removed and flash frozen. After some period of frozen storage, tissue homogenates were prepared. The level of NAD+ was quantified using LC/MS methods.
For bioanalysis, a method of standard addition was used to quantify the NAD. Each homogenate was divided and certain aliquots had known concentrations of exogenous NAD added. The NAD present in the original sample was then calculated by linear regression. Data are presented as a ratio of mean NAD concentration in treated mouse tissues to mean NAD concentration in the vehicle control group tissues at the paired time points.
Example 23A: Study Design for Assaying Levels of NAD+ in Mice
Mixtures of compound and PBS, pH 7 were formulated ˜1 hour before dosing and remained stirring until dose completion. Residual formulated test materials were stored at −20±5° C. until discarded. Naïve male C57/BL6 mice at ˜25 g at dose initiation, age as appropriate for weight were assigned to dose groups of six animals per dose. Dosing treatments were administered via a single oral gavage dose (PO) The dose volume for each animal (5 mL/kg) was based on the most recent body measurements taken the morning of dosing. Animals were fasted at least 16 hrs prior to dose, with food returned at least 4 hours post dose.
Liver and skeletal muscle were collected and analyzed for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) at 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-dose. For each mouse, the entire liver was removed, rinsed with saline, blotted dry and frozen at −70° C. to store for NAD concentration analysis. Also, the soleus skeletal muscle was removed from the gastrocnemius, rinsed with saline, blotted dry and frozen at −70° C. to store for NAD concentration analysis.
After thawing samples for analysis, the tissues were homogenized and extracted as follows:
Tissue Homogenization Procedure
1. Add 5× (tissue wt.*5) mL 0.1M ZnSO4 into all tubes.
2. Add 5× (tissue wt*5) mL Methanol into all tubes.
3. Homogenize each sample until completely liquid.
4. Vortex each sample.  Tissue Extraction Procedure
1. On ice, aliquot 20 μL of standards, control blanks, and matrix blanks into a 96-well plate.
2. Aliquot 20 μL of sample into sample wells.
3. Add 100 μL of IS in 80:20 Methanol:water into each well, except blanks add 100 μL of blank 80:20 Methanol:Water.
4. Cover plate and vortex samples. Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3300 rpm.
5. Transfer 80 μL of supernatant into a clean 96-well plate.
6. Add 80 μL of LC-MS water to all wells.
7. Cover and vortex.  The concentration of NAD+ in the tissues was determined by LC/MS. The conditions are as follows:  LC Conditions:  LC: Shimadzu UPLC  Autosampler: Shimadzu SIL-30AC  Analytical Column: Chromolith C18 RP-e 3.0×100 mm  Flow Rate: Variable flow 0.8 mL/min and 1.4 mL/min  Mobile Phases: A: dH2O B: 1.0% Formic Acid in 50:50 MeOH:ACN  Needle Rinse: dH2O  Injection Volume: 2.0 μL  LC Gradient Program: A 1.0 min gradient was utilized going from 0% to 98% of Mobile Phase B with a total run time of 3.00 minutes.
