CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
This application is a National Phase Application of PCT International Application No. PCT/CZ2015/000071, International Filing Date Jul. 8, 2015, entitled “METHOD OF PREPARING VORTIOXETINE” claiming priority of Czech Patent Application No. PV 014-471, filed Jul. 8, 2014, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
The invention relates to a new method of preparing 1-[2-(2,4-dimethylphenylsulphanyl)phenyl]piperazine of formula I known under the name vortioxetine. Vortioxetine is a modern atypical antidepressant, used in the form of hydrobromide under the trademark Brintellix.
BACKGROUND ART
Basic patent WO 2003029232 describes preparation of vortioxetine of formula I using a reaction in solid phase, wherein piperazine bound to the solid phase reacts with eta(6)-1,2-dichlorobenzene-eta(5)-cyclopentadienyl iron hexafluorophosphate in the presence of potash (K2CO3) in THF with formation of N,N′-disubstituted piperazine of formula II. This substance is then condensed with the sodium salt of 2,4-dimethylthiophenol of formula III, prepared in situ from the respective thiophenol and NaH. This condensation is carried out photochemically; subsequent cleaving from the solid phase by means of trifluoroacetic acid releases vortioxetine. Total yield of the described reaction is 17% (Scheme 1), purity (UV, ELSD) 95%, 100%.
Patent WO 2007/144005 describes a strategy starting from 2-bromoiodobenzene of formula IV and 2,4-dimethylthiophenol of formula III, which, in the presence of suitable catalysts, provide 1-(2-bromophenylsulphanyl)-2,4-dimethylbenzene of formula V. This can also be prepared by coupling of 1-iodo-2,4-dimethylbenzene of formula Via or 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene of formula VIb with 2-bromobenzenethiol of formula VII. Arylbromide of formula V is then converted to the vortioxetine base of formula I by the reaction with piperazine in the presence of a suitable catalytic system, typically in the presence of Pd(dba)2, BINAP, and t-BuONa. Piperazine can also be replaced by N-Boc-piperazine, providing the intermediate of formula VII, deprotection of which affords vortioxetine of formula I (Scheme 2).
Patent WO 2007/144005 also describes the synthesis of the intermediate of formula VII shown in Scheme 3, consisting in the reaction of 2-bromoiodobenzene of formula IV with N-Boc-piperazine in the presence of a suitable catalytic system, providing an intermediate of formula VIII, further coupling of which with the thiol of formula III provides the intermediate of formula VII.
The present invention, relating to a new procedure of preparing vortioxetine of formula I, in comparison with the known state of the art, provides an advantage of preparing vortioxetine of high purity (99.8%) using, in addition, cheap starting substances. Therefore, the proposed procedure is also beneficial from the economical point of view for industrial use and can be simply reproduced.
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION
The invention provides an improved method of preparing vortioxetine of formula I, comprising the reaction of the thiol of formula III with a suitable 2-nitrohalobenzene of formula IX, preferably with cheap 2-nitrochlorobenzene of formula IXb, in the presence of a base, preferably of sodium hydroxide, with formation of the nitro derivative of formula X. In the next step, the intermediate of formula X is reduced to the amino derivative of formula XL In the subsequent step, a piperazine ring is built by the reaction with a suitable precursor of formula XII possessing two easily leaving groups (LG), in a suitable solvent, preferably without presence of any base in a neutral or acidic environment. The nitrogen atom in such precursor can be protected with a suitable protective group (PG); in this case, the intermediate of formula XIII, formed by the reaction, is subsequently deprotected and provides vortioxetine of formula I. Precursors of formula XIIb with their nitrogen atom protected with a suitable protective group PG can preferably be compounds having halogenides or sulphonates as LG and COOR′ as protective groups, wherein R′ is a (un)branched C1-C5 alkyl, preferably ethoxycarbonyl or butyloxycarbonyl (Boc). Suitable precursors with unprotected N atom of formula Ma can preferably be used, where the reaction directly provides vortioxetine of formula I. Compounds having, as the LG, atoms of Cl, Br, I and groups OMs, OTs have proved preferable, the most preferable being bis-(2-chloroethyl)amine or its salts (Scheme 4).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION
The invention provides an improved method of preparing vortioxetine of formula I, comprising the reaction of the thiol of formula III with a suitable 2-nitrohalobenzene of formula IX, preferably with cheap 2-nitrochlorobenzene of formula IXb, in the presence of a base with formation of the nitro derivative of formula X. Suitable bases include alkali metal alcoholates (for instance, sodium methanolate, potassium methanolate, sodium ethanolate, potassium ethanolate, or potassium tert-butanolate), or alkali hydroxides (for instance, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, barium hydroxide). Using these bases, it is possible to first prepare the respective salt from the respective thiolate by any of commonly known procedures; the salt can then be used for reaction with the nitro derivative of formula IX, or the salt can be generated in situ using the mentioned bases. Preferably, carbonates or hydrogen carbonates (sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate) can be used as the bases and the respective salt can be generated in situ in the reaction mixture. The reaction can be carried out without presence of phase transfer catalysts, preferably, however, also in the presence of such compounds, for instance, quaternary ammonium salts (for instance, tetrabutylammonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate), crown ethers (for instance 18-crown-6, 15-crown-5).
The reduction of the nitro derivative (X) to the amino derivative of formula XI can be carried out under conditions known for this classical reaction. Reduction with metals (Fe, Zn, Sn) in an acidic environment using various acids (HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4), reduction with metal salts (SnCl2, FeSO4), but also other reducing agents commonly known for this reaction have proved useful for this reaction. Another possibility of carrying out the reduction of the nitro group is catalytic hydrogenation or transfer-hydrogenation on a suitable catalyst (for instance, hydrazine+activated charcoal+FeCl3). Due to the presence of the sulphur atom in the molecule of the intermediate (X), the choice of suitable catalysts is somewhat narrowed. Screening of catalytic hydrogenation and transfer-hydrogenation with using various catalysts based on Pt, Pd, Ni, Fe, or Co on various carriers in a series of solvents has been carried out. The best results have been reached with several batches of commercial catalysts based on Ni in solvents including alcohols, preferably C1-C5 (preferably methanol, ethanol) and C1-C5 esters (preferably ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, ethyl propionate).
The subsequent reaction of the amino derivative (XI) with precursors of formation of the piperazine nucleus of formula XII has been tested with several possible compounds of formula XII, including N-unsubstituted derivatives of formula XIIa and the respective N-protected compounds of formula XIIb. The reaction can be carried out in numerous solvents, preferably in aromatic solvents, such as chlorobenzene, xylene, toluene, α,α,α-trifluorotoluene at temperatures ranging between 100 and 140° C., preferably at 103-111° C., using 1-1.2 equivalents of the precursor of formula XII for 1 equivalent of the amino derivative of formula XI. Using 1 to 1.1 equivalents of the precursor of formula XII and carrying out the reaction in the presence of an alkali iodide (LiI, NaI, KI) or Bu4NI is especially preferable, more preferred in the presence of NaI or KI. The reaction is suitably carried out in a neutral or acidic environment, which leads to reduced content of impurities.
Vortioxetine of formula I can be preferably isolated in the form of suitable salts, for instance, in the form of well crystalline 4-chlorobenzoate or 3,5-dinitrobenzoate, which show good crystallizing and purifying properties, as well as high stability.
The invention is explained in more details in the following working examples. These examples, which elucidate the improvement of the procedure according to the invention, are of an exclusively illustrative character and do not limit the scope of the invention in any respect.
The term room temperature is intended to describe a temperature between 15° C. and 30° C., preferably between 20 and 25° C.
The term brine is intended to describe a saturated solution of sodium chloride.
