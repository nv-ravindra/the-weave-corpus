TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure belongs to the technical field of organic synthesis and particularly relates to a preparation method for 2-((4R,6S)-6-bromomethyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetate.
BACKGROUND
As an organic synthetic intermediate, 2-((4R,6S)-bromomethyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetate can be used for synthesis of statin antilipemic agents. Its chemical formula is shown in (I):
wherein R is alkyl or cycloalkyl having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or mono- or poly-substituted aryl or aralkyl.
Chinese Patent CN104356109 disclosed a method for preparing 2-((4R,6S)-6-bromomethyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetate (I) by bromination and cyclization of 3-((substituted oxycarbonyl)oxy)-5-hexanoate as raw material with brominating agent and alkali.
By this method, about 20% of the by-products resulted from the addition reaction of alkene and dibromo will be generated in addition to about 80% of the target product (I).
In Chinese Patent CN106588865, 2-((4R,6S)-6-bromomethyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetate (I) is prepared by bromination and cyclization of 3-((substituted oxycarbonyl)oxy)-5-hexenoate as also the same raw material with bromide and oxidant.
This method avoids the generation of dibromo by-products and thus has the certain technical advantages. However, this method has the detects of using the protective group, i.e., substituted oxycarbonyl, which resulted in the complicated starting material with a high molecular weight for the synthesis and is removed as waste after the reaction. Therefore, this method is high in cost and low in atomic economy.
Accordingly, it is necessary to develop an industrial production process for preparing 2-((4R,6S)-6-bromomethyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetate (I) with high efficiency, low cost and excellent atomic economy.
SUMMARY
An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a novel method for preparing 2-((4,6S)-6-bromomethyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetate (I) with simple process, low cost and reduced pollution, in order to make up the shortage of the prior art.
In the preparation method for 2-((4R,6S)-6-bromomethyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetate (I) provided by the present disclosure, 2-((4R,6S)-6-bromomethyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetate (I) is obtained by bromination and cyclization of 3-((substituted oxycarbonyl)oxy)-5-hexenoate (II) as raw material with hypochlorite and bromide in an organic solvent in the presence of CO2. The synthetic route is as follows:
wherein R and R′ are the same or different alkyl or cycloalkyl having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or mono- or poly-substituted aryl or aralkyl; and M is alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium cation.
Compared with the traditional processes, the method of the present disclosure omits the protection step by substituted oxycarbonyl. The involved oxidant i.e., hypochlorite, has the advantages of low molecular weight, easy preparation and low cost. This method can greatly reduce the production cost and reduce pollution. It has the excellent atomic economy and is applicable to industrial production for large scale process.
The starting material in the present disclosure, i.e., the compound (R)-3-hydroxy-5-hexenoate (II), can be prepared with reference to the International Patent WO2003053950 or Chinese Patent CN101735272. The hypochlorite used in preparation of the compound (I) from the compound (II) is ethyl hypochlorite, isopropyl hypochlorite, tert-butyl hypochlorite or the like. The hypochlorite can be prepared with reference to U.S. Pat. No. 2,694,722. The used inorganic bromide is selected from potassium bromide, sodium bromide, ammonium bromide and the like. The used organic solvent is selected from ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, tedrahydrofuran, methanol, acetic acid, N,N-dimethyl formamide, acetone and acetonitrile, or is a mixed solvent of more of the above solvents. Those solvents are inexpensive and readily available, and have been widely used in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.
In the present disclosure, a mole ratio of the compound (II) to hypochlorite to inorganic bromide is 1:(1-5):(1-5), and the reaction temperature is −60° C. to 50° C. CO2 may be under a normal pressure or an increased pressure. The reaction may be operated conveniently under a pressure of 0.1 MPa to 2 MPa. The reaction time ranges from 10 mins to 180 mins.
In the present disclosure, preferably:
during preparation of the compound (I) from the compound (II), the used hypochlorite is tert-butyl hypochlorite, the used bromide is potassium bromide, and the used organic solvent is dichloromethane.
A mole ratio of the compound (II) to hypochlorite to bromide is 1:(1.5-2.5):(1.5-2.5), the reaction temperature is −40° C. to 25° C., CO2 is under a pressure of 0.1 MPa to 1 MPa, and the reaction time is 30 mins to 60 mins.
The present disclosure has the advantages of the readily available and inexpensive raw material, mild reaction conditions, easy operation, simple process, efficient synthesis method and environmental protection, which is quite applicable to industrial production of this important intermediate.
