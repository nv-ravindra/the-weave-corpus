TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a dehydrogenation reaction catalyst containing an organometallic complex having a nitrogen-containing ligand. The present invention also relates to a dehydrogenation method employing the organometallic complex as a catalyst, a method for producing a carbonyl compound by a dehydrogenation reaction of an alcohol, and a method for producing hydrogen by a dehydrogenation reaction of an alcohol, formic acid, or a formate. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a novel organometallic complex having a nitrogen-containing ligand.
BACKGROUND ART
A dehydrogenation reaction of a hydrogen-containing organic compound is one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis, and is a reaction that has high utility value in industry. For example, a conversion reaction involving a dehydrogenation reaction (oxidation reaction) of an alcohol into a carbonyl compound such as an aldehyde, a ketone, or a carboxylic acid plays an important role in the production of organic compounds used in many fields such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, food, fragrances, and materials, or starting materials therefor. Furthermore, a method for producing hydrogen by a dehydrogenation reaction of an alcohol, formic acid, or a formate is a technique that has been attracting attention as a technique for supplying and storing hydrogen for a fuel cell.
Synthesis of a carbonyl compound by an oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of an alcohol is one of the most important functional group conversions in organic syntheses for obtaining intermediates for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, fragrances, etc., and in the past a large number of excellent oxidizing agents and oxidation reactions have been developed. For example, as a stoichiometric oxidizing reagent, an oxidation method using a heavy metal oxidizing agent (potassium permanganate, bichromic acid or a salt thereof, chromium trioxide, etc.), a DMSO oxidation method (Swern oxidation, etc.), etc. are known. It is difficult to use these oxidizing agents and oxidation methods industrially in terms of safety and environmental friendliness due to the production of large amounts of highly toxic waste material by-products and the occurrence of bad odors.
On the other hand, from the viewpoint of environmentally friendly green chemistry, catalytic oxidation reactions of alcohols using a co-oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide, acetone, or molecular oxygen have been developed. However, a reaction using a co-oxidizing agent has the problems that depending on the type of co-oxidizing agent, the reaction becomes complicated, and the substrates to which it can be applied are limited, and there is still room for improvement from the viewpoint of design of a catalytic reaction based on atom efficiency.
Thus, from a process chemistry viewpoint it is very important to develop a catalytic oxidation reaction of an alcohol without using a co-oxidizing agent, that is, a catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. In recent years, such reactions have been reported one after another and, for example, oxidative dehydrogenation reactions using ruthenium catalysts (Non-Patent Documents 1 to 5) or iridium catalysts (Non-Patent Documents 6 and 7) have been reported. However, there are problems in terms of industrial application, in that these reactions are carried out at a relatively high temperature, a reaction requiring basic conditions cannot be applied to a substrate that is unstable toward a base, and the amount of catalyst is relatively large.
Furthermore, Non-Patent Document 8 reports a dehydrogenative oxidation reaction of an alcohol using a cationic iridium complex; the reaction is carried out in aqueous solvent under reflux conditions, but while taking into consideration safety and economy it is desirable for it to be carried out at a lower temperature. Moreover, in this reaction, since the cationic iridium complex itself exhibits acidity, it is not suitable for a reaction of a substrate that is susceptible to decomposition in an acidic state. Furthermore, Non-Patent Document 9 reports a catalytic dehydrogenation reaction of a cyclic amine (2,6-dimethyldecahydro-1,5-naphthyridine) using a neutral iridium complex, but the use of an alcohol in a catalytic dehydrogenation reaction has not been tried.
From the above, there has been a desire for the development of a catalytic dehydrogenation reaction of an alcohol that can be carried out with a small amount of catalyst at a relatively low temperature.
Furthermore, an aldehyde is prepared by an oxidation reaction of a primary alcohol, and the aldehyde is further oxidized to give the corresponding carboxylic acid; being able to make this proceed as a one pot reaction is very important from the viewpoint of process chemistry. As a stoichiometric oxidizing agent that can be used for this purpose, potassium permanganate (KMnO4), Jones reagent, and pyridinium dichromate (PDC) are known, but it is difficult to carry out these methods industrially in terms of economy and safety such as a large amount of heavy metal being used and a highly toxic compound being produced as a by-product.
As catalytic methods, oxidation methods using ruthenium tetroxide, and TEMPO (Non-Patent Document 10) are known, but due to the conditions being relatively severe it is difficult to apply them to compounds having a large number of functional groups, and due to the use of a co-oxidizing agent there is still room for improvement from the viewpoint of design of a catalytic reaction based on atom efficiency. A method using sodium tungstate (Non-Patent Document 11) as a catalyst is a reaction that is accompanied by danger due to the use of a high concentration of aqueous hydrogen peroxide. 1-Me-AZADO oxidation (Patent Document 1), which has improved the defect of TEMPO oxidation, has also been developed, but since this method also requires a large amount of co-oxidizing agent, there has been a desire for the development of a catalyst that can reduce the environmental burden.
As described above, there has been a desire for the development of an oxidative dehydrogenation reaction that will take a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid via an aldehyde and that will progress with a small amount of catalyst without using a co-oxidizing agent.
On the other hand, hydrogen (H2) has conventionally been utilized in various industrial fields, such as for petroleum purification or as a chemical starting material, and in recent years it has received attention as fuel for a fuel cell. However, since hydrogen is gaseous at room temperature, highly reactive, and susceptible to ignition in air, the stable supply and storage of hydrogen is an important issue in the development of fuel cells. For example, as methods for storing hydrogen there are known a method in which it is stored as a compressed gas, a method in which hydrogen gas is liquefied and stored in the form of liquid hydrogen, and a method in which hydrogen is taken into a hydrogen absorbing alloy and stored. However, these methods have the problem that the amount of hydrogen stored per unit weight of storage medium is small and, in addition, there are problems with cost, safety, and handling.
In order to solve these problems, a method for storing hydrogen in the form of a substance other than H2 could be considered. For example, formic acid (HCO2H) is known to generate hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) when strongly heated. It is possible by utilizing this to store hydrogen in the form of formic acid, which is a stable substance, and to stably supply hydrogen by appropriately heating formic acid and generating hydrogen. However, since it is necessary to carry out a thermal decomposition reaction of formic acid at a high temperature, there has been a desire for the development of a catalyst that can generate hydrogen from formic acid with high efficiency under mild conditions.
As catalysts for the decomposition of formic acid, examples using a metal complex have already been reported. For example, a polynuclear metal complex containing iridium and ruthenium has been reported in Patent Document 2, but due to the use of two types of transition metals the production cost is high. Furthermore, a decomposition reaction of formic acid using a rhodium complex has been reported in Patent Document 3, but the rhodium complexes in the examples are limited to cationic aquo complexes having a bipyridyl-based ligand, and the amount of catalyst used is about 1 mol %, which cannot necessarily be said to be efficient.
From the above, there has been a desire for the development of a catalyst for a decomposition reaction of formic acid or a formate that has high reactivity with a small amount of catalyst under mild conditions.

From the viewpoint of catalytic efficiency and reaction yield, in particular, an organometallic complex of Formula (1), wherein Ar is an optionally substituted cyclopentadienyl group, M is iridium, and L is an aquo ligand, that is, an aquo complex, is preferable. Although the reason why this aquo complex exhibits very high catalytic efficiency and reaction yield is not necessarily clear, it is surmised that an aquo ligand easily dissociates and a coordinatively-unsaturated active species is easily generated.

One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for producing from the alcohol the corresponding carbonyl compound by means of the dehydrogenation method of the present invention.

When it is a secondary alcohol, a ketone is obtained, as shown by for example the following reaction formula.
R8 and R9 are as described above.
One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for producing a carboxylic acid from a primary alcohol via an aldehyde using the dehydrogenation method of the present invention. It is thought that this conversion from an alcohol to a carboxylic acid progresses via three steps, that is, 1) formation of an aldehyde by dehydrogenation of the alcohol, 2) formation of a hemiacetal by hydration of the aldehyde, and 3) formation of a carboxylic acid by dehydrogenation of the hemiacetal. Therefore, when producing a carboxylic acid, it is preferable to use a solvent containing water in order to hydrate the aldehyde to form the hemiacetal. Specific examples of the production include, but are not limited to, production of acetic acid from ethanol.
One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for producing hydrogen from an alcohol, preferably a primary alcohol, using the dehydrogenation method of the present invention. The alcohol is not particularly limited, but is preferably a primary alcohol from the viewpoint of hydrogen generation efficiency, and is preferably produced by dehydrogenation of a solution in which it is mixed with water. For example, when the primary alcohol is methanol, 3 moles of molecular hydrogen are formed by dehydrogenation of a mixed solution of 1 mole of methanol:water=1:1, and formally all the hydrogen atoms in a methanol molecule and all of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule are converted into hydrogen molecules, which is very efficient as a hydrogen production method.
In the production of hydrogen, a dehydrogenation reaction can progress at a pH of 1 to 14. From the viewpoint of hydrogen generation efficiency, the pH is preferably 5 to 14, and particularly preferably 10 to 14. Since carbon dioxide is generated accompanying progress of the reaction, and the reaction system gradually becomes acidic, efficient hydrogenation can be continued for a long period of time by setting the pH at the start of reaction at 13 or greater.
In accordance with the present invention, a carboxylic acid and hydrogen can be obtained from a primary alcohol at the same time. This enables a carboxylic acid, which is important in organic industrial chemistry, and hydrogen, which is useful as clean energy, to be obtained at the same time using as a starting material an alcohol obtained by fermentation from a biomass resource.
One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for producing hydrogen by a decomposition reaction of formic acid or a formate using the dehydrogenation method of the present invention. In accordance with the present invention, since it can be carried out at a reaction temperature of on the order of 60° C. to 90° C., it is excellent in terms of safety and economy and is very advantageous for industrial use.
In the dehydrogenation method of the present invention, the amount of catalyst used can be expressed as S/C (S is the number of moles of alcohol, formic acid, or formate, and C is the number of moles of catalyst), which is the molar ratio of alcohol, formic acid, or formate relative to ruthenium, rhodium, or iridium complex. In this case, the degree to which S/C can be increased greatly depends on the structure of the substrate, the type of catalyst, the concentration, the reaction temperature, the type of reaction solvent, etc, but in practice it is desirable to set S/C equal to on the order of 50 to 500000.
The dehydrogenation reaction of the present invention is carried out in the presence or absence of solvent. When a solvent is used, the reaction solvent may be selected as appropriate while taking into consideration the physical properties and the chemical properties of catalyst, substrate, and product. A protic solvent, an aprotic solvent, an ionic liquid, water, or a buffer may be used on their own or in a combination of a plurality thereof.
Specific examples of the solvent include, but are not limited to, pentane, hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, xylene, tetrahydrofuran, diisopropyl ether, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide, t-butanol, and water.
The reaction temperature may preferably be on the order of −20° C. to 200° C., and more preferably 20° C. to 150° C., while taking into consideration solubility, reactivity, and economic efficiency of catalyst, substrate, and product.
With regard to the reaction time, although it varies depending on reaction conditions such as substrate concentration and reaction temperature, the reaction is completed in a few minutes to 100 hours.
Purification of a carbonyl compound prepared by the dehydrogenation reaction may be carried out by a known method such as acid-base extraction, column chromatography, distillation, or recrystallization, or by a combination thereof as appropriate.
In accordance with the dehydrogenation method of the present invention, a reaction is possible over a wide range of pH. In the dehydrogenation reaction of an alcohol, the pH may be 1 to 14, and preferably 4 to 10, and from a synthetic chemistry viewpoint the pH is preferably 6 to 8.
In the production of a carboxylic acid, the pH can change toward the acidic side accompanying formation of the carboxylic acid, but the reaction progresses in a pH region of to 14. From a synthetic chemistry viewpoint it is preferable to start at a pH of 6 to 8, which is the neutral region, and from the viewpoint of efficiency of formation of a carboxylic acid it is preferable for the pH of the reaction system to be in the range of 1 to 10 throughout the reaction; it is particularly preferable for the pH to be in the range of 1 to 8.

One aspect of the present invention relates to an organometallic compound of Formula (2) below
wherein

Z is Na, Li, K, or Cs.
A compound of Formula (2) may be produced by a reaction between an alkaline compound and an organometallic compound of Formula (1) where L is an aquo ligand. Examples of the alkaline compound include, but are not limited to, sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and cesium hydroxide. Therefore, a compound of Formula (2) may be prepared in the reaction system by adding an alkaline compound in a dehydrogenation reaction using as a catalyst an organometallic compound of Formula (1) where L is an aquo ligand.
A compound of Formula (2) may be used in the same way as for a compound of Formula (1) in the dehydrogenation method, the method for producing a carbonyl compound, the method for producing hydrogen, etc. described above for a compound of Formula (1). Therefore, the present invention relates to a dehydrogenation catalyst containing a compound of Formula (2).
The method for producing hydrogen according to the present invention involves producing hydrogen continuously from a mixture of an alcohol and water. From the viewpoint of efficiency in particular, it is preferable to use a compound of Formula (2).
As methods for continuously producing hydrogen there can be cited, for example, a consecutive addition method and a continuous addition method. The consecutive addition method involves adding to a mixture of an alcohol and water a compound of Formula (1) and/or Formula (2) and an alkaline compound, carrying out a reaction under reflux by heating to thus generate hydrogen, then adding amounts of alcohol and water corresponding to those consumed, and further adding an alkaline compound. It is preferable for the pH after each addition to be identical to the pH at the time of starting the reaction. In this way, by consecutively adding the amounts consumed, hydrogen can be produced continuously.
The continuous addition method involves adding a compound of Formula (1) and/or Formula (2) and an alkaline compound to a mixture of an alcohol and water, starting the reaction system under reflux by heating, and continuing to add a premixed mixture of alcohol, water, and alkaline compound using for example a syringe pump, a micro-feeder, etc. in a state in which reflux is continued. In this way, hydrogen gas can be produced at a substantially constant rate for a long period of time by continuously carrying out a reaction while replenishing the amounts, corresponding to the rate at which they are consumed, of the starting materials (alcohol and water) and sodium hydroxide that are consumed continuously at a constant rate.
In accordance with the method for producing hydrogen, in which hydrogen is produced continuously, according to the present invention, it is possible to achieve a catalytic turnover number of at least 2, at least 100, preferably at least 1000, and more preferably at least 3500, and it is possible to construct a new system having very high efficiency and high practicality.
Examples of a system for continuously producing hydrogen include, but are not limited to, a system containing a reaction vessel, a supply section, and a recovery section. The reaction vessel is not particularly limited as long as it can subject a starting material to a dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of a catalyst, but is preferably one in which the reaction can be made continuous, and is typically equipped with devices that can carry out heating and refluxing. The supply section typically contains storage vessels for storing starting materials and alkaline compound for replenishment addition, and supply means such as a syringe pump or a micro-feeder. The recovery section is not particularly limited as long as it recovers the hydrogen generated, and examples include a gas burette, a gas bag, and a gas tank.
One aspect of the present invention relates not only to the dehydrogenation reaction but also to hydrogenation and interconversion by reversible dehydrogenation-hydrogenation. For example, in a catalytic reaction of reaction formula (II) wherein  R8 and R9 are as described above,  (i) is a dehydrogenation reaction and (ii) is hydrogenation,
the catalyst of the present invention can repeatedly carry out quantitative interconversion, that is, catalytic reactions in both directions (i) and (ii), accompanied by release and absorption of hydrogen.
By reversibly and continuously carrying out a dehydrogenation reaction and hydrogenation using the same catalyst, it can be expected that the system will be developed as a hydrogen storage system.

Example 34
<Reaction Involving Generation of Hydrogen from Mixture of Methanol and Water>
Dehydrogenation reactions from a mixture of methanol and water were carried out using complexes A, 1, and 3 described above as catalysts. The reactions were carried out using methanol and water as starting materials in the presence of catalyst while heating and refluxing, and the gas that was generated was collected in a gas burette and quantitatively measured. Of the volume of gas, 75% was considered to be hydrogen, and the volume and yield of hydrogen were calculated and are listed in the table. First, equal parts of methanol (20 mmol) and water (20 mmol) were used as starting materials, they were heated and refluxed in the presence of catalyst A, 1, and 3 (0.5 mol %) for 20 hours, and the activities of the catalysts were compared (entries 1-3). The reaction hardly progressed when catalyst A, which is dicationic, or catalyst 1, which is neutral, was used, and it was observed that only a very small amount of hydrogen was generated (entries 1 and 2), but the reaction progressed with the use of catalyst 3, which is anionic, and 120 mL (yield 8%) of hydrogen could be obtained (entry 3). Second, the number of equivalents of water relative to methanol was changed (entries 3-5), and when four equivalents of water were used a maximum amount of hydrogen was generated (150 mL, yield 10%, entry 4). Subsequently, since in this catalyst system carbon dioxide is generated accompanying the progress of the reaction, the system gradually becomes acidic, it can be expected that the catalyst molecule will be converted from anionic complex 3 to neutral complex 1 and further to dicationic complex A, and in order to prevent this the addition of a base (sodium hydroxide) as an additive was investigated (entries 6-9). This greatly improved the yield of hydrogen; the optimum conditions were obtained when 0.5 mol % of sodium hydroxide was added, and 1223 mL (yield 84%) of hydrogen was obtained (entry 7).  TABLE 6

First, catalyst 3 (0.1 mol %) and sodium hydroxide (0.5 mol %) were added to a mixture of methanol (20 mmol) and water (80 mmol). At this point, the pH of the system was 11.2. When a reaction of this mixture was carried out under reflux conditions for 20 hours, 607.5 mL (yield 41%) of hydrogen was generated. Here, amounts of methanol (8.2 mmol) and water (8.2 mmol) corresponding to those consumed were added to the reaction system, sodium hydroxide (0.5 mol %) was again added to thus adjust the pH of the system to 11.3, and a reaction was then carried out under reflux conditions for 20 hours, and 611.3 mL (yield 41%) of hydrogen was generated. By repeating the same procedure, 562.5 mL (yield 38%) of hydrogen could be obtained.
By such a continuous method for generating hydrogen, a total of 1781.3 mL (71.5 mmol) of hydrogen could be obtained, and a catalytic turnover number of 1191 was achieved. In accordance with a procedure of continuously adding starting materials (mixture of methanol and water) that are safe and easy to handle and sodium hydroxide to the catalyst and heating, a new system that can continuously generate hydrogen gas can be developed.

<Method for Generating Hydrogen from Methanol and Water (Continuous Addition Method No. 1)>
In order to replenish the amounts of methanol and water that had been consumed accompanying catalytic generation of hydrogen, an experiment involving addition at a constant rate using a syringe pump was carried out.
First, catalyst 3 (0.1 mol %) and sodium hydroxide (0.5 mol %) were added to a mixture of methanol (20 mmol) and water (80 mmol). At this point, the pH of the system was 11.2. Refluxing of the reaction system was started by heating, and a premixed solution [methanol (0.6 mmol/h), water (0.6 mmol/h), sodium hydroxide (0.001 mmol/h)] was added using a syringe pump. The generation of gas at a substantially constant rate was observed by continuing refluxing; after 50 hours 2385 mL of hydrogen (99.61 mmol) could be obtained, and a catalytic turnover number of 1660 was achieved.
In accordance with such a continuous reaction by replenishing consumed starting materials (methanol and water) and sodium hydroxide at amounts corresponding to the consumption rates, hydrogen gas can be generated continuously at a substantially constant rate over a long period of time (50 hours).

The generation of gas at a substantially constant rate was observed by continuing refluxing; after 150 hours 4946 mL of hydrogen (210.2 mmol) could be obtained, and a catalytic turnover number of 3502 was achieved.
In accordance with such a continuous reaction by replenishing the consumed starting materials (methanol and water) and sodium hydroxide at amounts corresponding to the consumption rates, hydrogen gas can be generated continuously at a substantially constant rate over a long period of time (150 hours).

A catalytic reaction for obtaining hydrogen at the same time as obtaining, using a mixture of a lower alcohol (ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol) and water as starting materials, a carboxylic acid having the corresponding number of carbons was examined.
