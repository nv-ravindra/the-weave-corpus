FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to organic compounds useful for therapy and/or prophylaxis in a human, and in particular to Hepatitis B virus (HBV) inhibitors by targeting on HBV capsid useful for treating HBV infection.
HBV is a species of the hepadnaviridae family of viruses. HBV is a serious public health problem worldwide, with more than 400 million people especially in Asia-pacific regions chronically infected by this small enveloped DNA virus. Although most individuals seem to resolve the infection following acute symptoms, 15-40% of HBV patients will finally develop clinical diseases during their lifespan, most notably, hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Every year 500,000 to 1 million people die from the end stage of liver diseases caused by HBV infection.
HBV lifecycle begins with the binding of the “Dane” particle with an unidentified receptor on the surface of hepatocyte. Following entry, viral genome is delivered into nucleus where a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is formed through DNA repair of viral relaxed circular DNA. Unlike the mechanisms of most other DNA viruses, HBV cccDNA replicates through the retrotranscription of a 1.1-genome unit-length RNA copy (pregenomic RNA). Viral pregenomic RNA interacts with other two viral components, capsid protein and polymerase, as well as some host factors, to form capsid particles where viral DNA replication occurs. Most copies of the encapsidated genome then efficiently associate with the envelope proteins for virion assembly and secretion; a minority of these genomes are shunted to the nucleus, where they are converted to cccDNA.
Currently, there are two types of anti-HBV agents on the market, nucleoside (tide) analogs targeting viral polymerase (lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, telbivudine and entecavir) and interferon modulating host immune functions. Mutations in the primary sequence of the polymerase that confer resistance to lamivudine and adefovir have been identified clinically and underlie a rebound of serum virus titers that 70% of treated patients experience within 3 years of the start of lamivudine therapy. Although resistance to telbivudine, adefovir, and entecavir occurs more rarely, it has been recorded. Interferon alpha is the other major therapy available for hepatitis B, but it is limited by a poor long-term response and debilitating side effects. Some viral genotypes do not show good responses to interferon therapy. Now, the standard of clinic cure of HBV infection is the loss and/or seroconversion of HBsAg. The majority (around or more than 90%) of treated patients fail to achieve this goal. This drawback is mainly due to the presence of a stable pool of viral cccDNA in nucleus that doesn't replicate itself, therefore, shows no accessibility to nucleoside (tide) analogs.
Hence, there is certainly a medical need for treatments with improved characteristics, and for a diversity of approaches in the development of therapies for HBV infection.
HBV capsid protein plays essential roles in HBV replication. HBV has an icosahedral core comprising of 240 copies of the capsid (or core) protein. The predominant biological function of capsid protein is to act as a structural protein to encapsidate pre-genomic RNA and form immature capsid particles in the cytoplasm. This step is prerequisite for viral DNA replication. The HBV capsid spontaneously self-assembles from many copies of core dimers present in the cytoplasm. It has been shown that the formation of a trimeric nucleus and the subsequent elongation reactions occur by adding one dimeric subunit at a time until it is complete. Besides this function, capsid protein regulates viral DNA synthesis through different phosphorylation status of its C-terminal phosphorylation sites. When a near full-length relaxed circular DNA is formed through reverse-transcription of viral pregenomic RNA, an immature capsid becomes a mature capsid. On one hand, capsid protein might facilitate the nuclear translocation of viral relaxed circular genome by means of the nuclear localization signals located in the Arginine-rich domain of the C-terminal region of capsid protein. In nucleus, as a component of viral cccDNA minichromosome, capsid protein could play a structural and regulatory role in the functionality of cccDNA minichromosomes. Capsid protein also interacts with viral large envelope protein in endoplasmic reticulum and triggers the release of intact viral particles from hepatocytes.
There have been a couple of capsid related anti-HBV inhibitors reported. For example, phenylpropenamide derivatives, including compounds named AT-61 and AT-130 (Feld J. et al. Antiviral Research 2007, 168-177), and a class of thiazolidin-4-ones from Valeant R&D (WO2006/033995), have been shown to inhibit pgRNA packaging. A recent study suggested that phenylpropenamides are, in fact, accelerators of HBV capsid assembly, and their actions result in the formation of empty capsids. These very interesting results illustrate the importance of the kinetic pathway in successful virus assembly.
Heteroaryldihydropyrimidines or HAP, including compounds named Bay 41-4109, Bay 38-7690 and Bay 39-5493, were discovered in a tissue culture-based screening (Deres K. et al. Science 2003, 893). These HAP analogs act as synthetic allosteric activators and are able to induce aberrant capsid formation that leads to degradation of the core protein. HAP analogs also reorganized core protein from preassembled capsids into noncapsid polymers, presumably by interaction of HAP with dimers freed during capsid ‘breathing’, the transitory breaking of individual intersubunit bonds. Bay 41-4109 was administered to HBV infected transgenic mouse or humanized mouse models and demonstrated in vivo efficacy with HBV DNA reduction (Deres K. et al. Science 2003, 893; Brezillon N. et al. PLoS ONE 2011, e25096.). It was also shown that bis-ANS, a small molecule that acts as a molecular ‘wedge’ and interferes with normal capsid-protein geometry and capsid formation (Zlotnick A. et al. J. Virol. 2002, 4848-4854).

It is very important for a drug to have a moderate or low clearance, as this often lead to a good oral bioavailability and high exposure in target organ. Reducing the clearance of a compound or drug could then potentially reduce drastically the daily dose required for efficacy and therefore give a much better safety profile as well. From the examples below, it has been found a marked increase of metabolic stability and liver exposure of 4-methyldihydropyrimidines of current invention.
4-Hydrogen-dihydropyrimidines such as Bay 41-4109 can be oxidized to pyrimidine product XLVI when treated with human, rat or mouse liver microsomes. In this experiment, pooled liver microsomes (20 mg/ml) from human, male Wister rat and male CD-1 mouse were obtained from BD Bioscience (Franklin Lakes, N.J. USA). Incubation reaction mixtures contained a final concentration of 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.5 mg/ml microsomal protein, 5 μM of the tested compounds and 1 mM NADPH in a total volume of 400 μl. The incubations were done for 60 minutes and 300 μl of the mixtures was transferred to 150 μl of ice cold methanol to terminate reactions. After vortexes for 3 minutes and centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4° C. for 10 minutes, the clear supernatant was used directly for analysis. The samples were analyzed by Applied Biosystems API 3200 Q TRAP LC/MS/MS system using electrospray ionization mode.
Pyrimidine product XLVI was the major metabolite in the in vitro clearance tests ( FIG. 1 ), and it was inactive to HBV DNA reduction in HepDE19 cell based assays with EC50 value above 100 μM. On the other hand, the 4-methyl-dihydropyrimidines series in this invention do not have the aromatization issues of the core structure.
HBV viruses infect hepatocyte cells and replicate in the liver. To have effective viral suppression, it is important for an anti-HBV drug to have sufficient exposure in the target organ. The following findings highlight increased metabolic stability and high liver exposure of 4-methyldihydropyrimidine analogs in this invention.
In this experiment, fresh mouse liver sample was homogenized by adding saline (1 g liver tissue: 5 mL saline) immediately after collection. After centrifuging for 10 minutes at 14000 rpm, the pooled supernatant was used to prepare liver homogenate solutions. The effective compounds concentrations in liver homogenate were 100, 300, and 1000 ng/mL. Then, they were incubated at rt. After incubation time of 0, 15 and 30 minutes, 180 μl aliquots of MeOH was added into 20 μl of homogenate, respectively. All these samples were vortex mixed for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14000 rpm. The supernatants were transferred into a 96-well plate for LC-MS/MS analysis. The results were summarized and showed in Table 3.  TABLE 3

By comparing the peak area of individual samples at 15 and 30 min to the one at 0 min from same concentration level, the stability of Bay41-4109 and Example 13 in CD-1 mouse liver homogenate was evaluated.
It can be obviously concluded that Bay41-4109 is not stable in liver homogenate treated with saline. About 2% of compound was detected after 15 minutes room temperature incubation, at three different concentration levels. In samples incubated for 30 minutes, only 0.16% can be found (at 1000 ng/mL. Not detected in 100 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL samples due to instrument sensitivity).
It can be concluded that Example 13 is stable in in liver homogenate treated with saline.
The in vivo DMPK of selected compounds were evaluated in male ICR mice following intravenous (or i.v.) or oral (or p.o.) administration. In single dose pharmacokinetics (SDPK) studies, compounds were dissolved in 6% Solutol solution (Solutol:Ethanol, 1:1, v/v), and 94% 0.9% saline for i.v. dose. For p.o. administration, compounds were mixed with 0.89% microcrystalline cellulose and 0.11% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium water solution, or 1% RC591 as suspensions. The single dose exposure levels of Bay 41-4109, Example 6, Example 11, Example 13 and Example 19 in mouse plasma and/or liver are shown as FIG. 2-6 .

HBV Inhibition Assays (Biochemical Assay)
Cells and culture conditions: HepDE19 (Haitao Guo et al, Journal of Virology, 81, November 2007, 12472-12484; Richeng Mao et al, Journal of Virology, 85, January 2011, 1048-1057) cells were derived from HepG2 (ATCC, American Type Culture Collection) cells through transfection with pTet-off plasmid (Clontech) that expresses the Tet-responsive transcriptional activator and pTREHBVDE plasmid in which HBV pgRNA expression is controlled by a CMV early promoter with a tetracycline-responsive element. The transfected cells were selected with G418 (also known as Genticin, purchased from Invitrogen). In tetracycline-free medium, cells support high levels of HBV DNA replication and HBV virus secretion. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 mg/ml of G418 and 1 μg/ml tetracycline.
Anti-HBV activity and cytotoxicity: HepDE19 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (3×104 cells/well) with tetracycline-free medium and incubated overnight at 37° C. The test or control compounds were serially half-log diluted with medium and added into the plates (the final concentration of DMSO kept at 0.5% in each well). Five days after compound treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 50 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA-0.2% CA-630 (pH 8.0) at 37° C. for 20 min. After centrifugation to remove nuclei and other debris, the supernatant was transferred into a new plate and incubated with 2M NaOH/20×SSC (3M NaCl, 0.3M Sodium citrate, pH7.0) at rt for 30 min. Then the samples were transferred to nylon membrane and neutralized with 1M Tris (pH7.4)/2M NaCl. The presence of HBV DNA was detected by dot-blot with DIG-labeled HBV specific DNA probe and quantified by dot density. The compound concentrations that inhibited HBV DNA by 50% (EC50) were determined (See Table 1).
To determine if the anti-HBV effect of compound is due to cytotoxicity, HepDE 19 cells (5×103 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates and compounds were treated as described above. Five days after treatment, cell viability was measured by addition of 20 μl of CCK-8 reagent. Four hours after incubation at 37° C., the absorbance at wavelengths of 450 nm and 630 nm (OD450 and OD630) was recorded by a plate reader. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of each compounds were determined accordingly.
The compounds of the present invention were tested for their capacity to inhibit a HBV activity and activation as described herein. The Examples were tested in the above assay and found to have EC50 of about 0.01 μM to about 50 μM. Particular compounds of formula I were found to have EC50 of about 0.41 μM to about 30 μM.
Results of HepDe19 EC50 (μM) and CC50 (μM) are given in Table 1.
