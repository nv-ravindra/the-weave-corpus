TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to new 1,10-dihydro[1,4]oxazino[3,2-h][2,3]benzodiazepin-2(3H)-one compounds having a selective dual action on the central GABAergic system, to a process for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.
BACKGROUND ART
γ-Aminobutyric acid (or GABA) is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. In the prosencephalon, GABA is mainly synthesised by interneurons which co-ordinate complex neuronal circuits via GABAA and GABAB receptors. The GABAA receptors are ligand-activated chloride channels largely localised to the plasma membrane. Typically, GABAA receptors are made up of five analogous membrane spanning protein subunits that assemble from a reportory of protein subunits α (6 genes): β (3 genes): γ (3 genes) in a ratio of 2:2:1, respectively. It is generally assumed that two identical isoforms of each subunit are incorporated into a particular receptor [Atack J R (2011) Curr Top Med Chem 11: 1203-1214].
Classical benzodiazepine compounds such as diazepam allosterically modulate GABAA receptors by binding to the benzodiazepine (BDZ) site that spans the interface of one of the alpha and the gamma subunit of the receptor. Diazepam as a non-selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of GABA action brings about sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anti-convulsant, amnesic, anti-nociceptive and myorelaxant effects.
Knock-in genetic experiments have shown that the α1 subunit is responsible for the sedative actions whilst the α2 and possibly α3 subunits are responsible for the anxiolytic potency of BDZ-site PAMs [Möhler H (2012) Neuropharmacol 62: 42-53]. Compounds behaving as negative allosteric modulators (NAM) at the BDZ-site are also referred to as “inverse agonists”. BDZ-site NAM compounds that have no GABAA isoform selectivity show nootropic properties in preclinical tests. However, major pro-convulsive and anxiogenic effects have prevented further clinical studies from being carried out on these compounds
The biological functions of GABAA receptors containing the α5 subunit have been assessed in genetically altered animals as well as with the aid of BDZ-site modulators that appear to be selective in vitro. Electrophysiological studies show that a tonic inhibitory potential exists in most neocortical pyramidal neurons, and that this potential sets the intrinsic excitability threshold of the cells. Moreover, in prefrontal cortex pyramidal cells but not in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, there is a complementarity between Ih mediated by HCN channels and the GABAA α5 mediated tonic current in regulating neuronal firing. This suggests that GABAA α5 inhibitors will have a much greater impact on pyramidal cell activity in the frontal cortex than in the hippocampus. Behaviourally, gene-deletion or reduction of the number of GABAA α5 receptors is associated with an improvement in cognitive functions. Moreover, treatment with various α5 selective NAMs enhanced cognitive performance in intact rodents as well as in a mouse model of Down's syndrome. In humans, the amnestic effect of acute alcohol consumption was attenuated by an α5 selective BDZ-site NAM.
GABAergic neurotransmission is also fundamentally important for the normal function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It has been proposed that deficits in working memory in schizophrenic patients might be a consequence of reduced GABAergic control of neural circuits in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [Lewis D A et al. (2008) Am. J. Psychiatry. 165: 1585-1593]. At the cellular level, GABAergic chandelier cells regulate the activity of pyramidal neurons via GABAA α2 receptors located at the axon initial segment. This mechanism appears important for the maintenance the optimal synchronization of pyramidal neuron activity at gamma band frequency in the prefrontal cortex. However, a recent report indicated that enhancement of GABAA α2/α3 function may not be sufficient for the improvement of cognitive function [Buchanan R W et al. (2011) Biol. Psych. 69: 442-449]. Indeed, prevailing theories stress the need for hippocampal-prefrontal synchronisation and connectivity for optimal cognitive function [Akbarian S (2008) Am. J. of Psychiatry 165: 1507-1509; Uhlhaas P J et al (2008) Schizophr Bull 34: 927-943].
On the basis of the mechanisms outlined above, simultaneous augmention of GABAergic neurotransmission at GABAA α2 subunits on the axon initial segments of pyramidal cells and attenuation of tonic inhibition by blockade of GABAA α5 receptors in the hippocampus may be predicted to improve the cognitive dysfunction in different disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, and dementias of different origin.
There exists a large, unsatisfied need in the treatment of cognitive deficits associated with various age-related disorders, neurodegenerative or vascular disorders as well as schizophrenia. Current treatments for Alzheimer's disease, the pathology with the greatest prevalence, are based either on inhibition of cholinesterase (e.g. donepezil) or on NMDA antagonism (memantine). However, cholinesterase inhibitors have a large number of undesirable effects relating to their mechanism of action, whilst the true efficacy of memantine is limited. Consequently, having new therapies of greater efficacy and better tolerability would be especially valuable.

Pharmacological Studies
Effect on GABAA α1, α2 and α5 subunits.
Method
The compounds are tested on HEK-293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) cells stably expressing the α2 α2 or the α5 subunit of the human GABAA receptor in association with the beta2 (short) and gamma2 (long) subunits, thus forming heteropentameric GABAA receptors. The cells are maintained in the presence of a selection of three antibiotics—neomycin, zeocin and puromycin—in a Dulbecco medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum The membrane potential is monitored using the fluorescent blue FMP dye (Molecular Devices), following the instructions of the manufacturer. On the day before the experiment, the cells are transferred to 96-well plates (in a density of 50,000 cells/well). 18-24 h later the cells are washed and incubated with the compounds under test plus the FMP dye. Recording of the fluorescence signal in a FlexStation3 plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA) is started 40 min later. After 30 sec of monitoring baseline fluorescence GABA is added to evoke a fluorescent signal reporting depolarisation of the membrane potential across the plasma membrane. The GABA induced responses are recorded for 90 seconds. Data are calculated by subtracting the average baseline value and computing the area under the curve of the fluorescence signal induced by GABA. The IC50 values for α5 and the EC50 values for α2 of the tested compounds are determined from log concentration versus response curves obtained by non-linear regression using SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices, USA).

α1 and α5 expressed as % of GABA EC50,
α2 expressed as % of the maximal effect of 100 nmol/L TPA-023 ran as internal standard at GABA EC20
On the basis of results shown in Table 1 the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention markedly enhance the GABA response in cells expressing GABAA α2 subunits, whilst inhibiting the effect of GABA in cells expressing α5 subunits, and having a weak or negligible effect on α1 containing GABAA receptors. The effect is considered weak if the EC50/IC50 value is >10 μmol/L.
Pharmacological Activity
Procognitive Efficacy
Methods
Novel Object Recognition Test in Mice
The novel object recognition test evaluates the ability of mice to detect novelty in an otherwise familiar environment. Subsequent a short exploratory period, mice are unable to discriminate between the familiar and the new object 24 hours later. Administration of pro-cognitive agents—before the short exploratory session—can significantly increase the time spent exploring the novel object on the following (retention) day. Enhancement of the discrimination index is considered as a procognitive effect. The results are illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 .
Radial Maze Test in Rats
The 8-arm maze working memory test evaluates short-term memory in rats. After about 15 days of learning trials the animals can acquire the ability to visit each arm only once. NMDA antagonist agents (for example ketamine, phencyclidine) disrupt this ability—the animals make more errors i.e. visit arms more than once. Administration of pro-cognitive agents before the trial significantly improves diminished performance in this test. The results are illustrated in FIG. 3 . The results show that the compounds of the invention bring about a significant improvement of memory function in laboratory animals.
Antipsychotic Activity
Method
Prepulse Inhibition Test in Mice
The startle reaction of a healthy rodents and humans to a strong acoustic stimulus is reduced by the prior presentation of a weak stimulus. The effect of the weak stimulus on the startle response has been termed prepulse inhibition (PPI). Reduced prepulse inhibition is a hallmark feature of attention-processing (sensorimotor gating) deficits in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Acute administration of phencyclidine (PCP), an antagonist of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors, disrupts PPI in rodents and this effect can be prevented by clinically effective antipsychotics. The results are illustrated in FIG. 4 . The results show that the compounds of the invention exert antipsychotic activity.
Anxiolytic Activity
Methods
Light-Dark Test in Mice
The light-dark apparatus contains a light (brightly illuminated) and a dark compartment. A small opening connects the two parts. During the 5 minutes test mice were placed individually in the light compartment and allowed to explore the entire apparatus. The activity of animals was measured automatically by interruptions of horizontal and vertical infrared beams. An increase of time spent in the light area (increase in light horizontal time) is interpreted as an anxiolytic effect. The results are illustrated in FIG. 5 .
Social Interaction Test in Rats
The social interaction test is a model used to measure anxiolytic or anxiogenic behaviour in rodents. When a pair of unfamiliar rats is placed together in the open field the animals show specific social behaviours (sniffing, following, grooming, crawling over and under other rats). Anxiolytic compounds such as benzodiazepines increase in the time spent with social interactions. In our experiment rats were submitted to the social interaction test of anxiety 30 min after drug treatment. The social interaction test consisted of 10 min of social encounters between two animals that received the same pharmacological treatment. The results are illustrated in FIG. 6 . The results show that the compounds of invention demonstrate significant anxiolytic efficacy.
