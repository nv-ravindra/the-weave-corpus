FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to the field of dye synthesis, and more particularly to a solvent medium for diazotization reaction.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART
Azo disperse dyes are widely used in dyeing textiles such as synthetic fibers, due to its' simple preparation method, complete chromatography and low cost. Furthermore, Azo disperse dyes have also been extensively used in pigments, paper and the like.
Diazotization and coupling reactions are two most important steps of preparation of azo disperse dyes. The principle of diazotization reaction is as following: a diazotization reagent such as sodium nitrite in-situ or on-site generates a electrophilic reagent in an acidic condition, and the electrophilic reagent attack amino groups of aromatic primary amines to generate a nitrosamine, then the nitrosamine rearranges and dehydrates in an acidic condition to finally obtain a diazonium salt.
Thus, the concentration and amount of an acid is one of the key factors of the diazotization reaction. And, in the diazotization reaction the acid has the following functions: (1) dissolving an aromatic primary amine; (2) reacting with a diazotization reagent such as sodium nitrite to generate nitrous acid, thereby resulting in an active electrophilic reagent; (3) taking part in the dehydration of the nitrosamine to obtain a diazonium salt. Although based on the diazotization reaction it is calculated that the molar ratio of amino groups of the aromatic primary amine and the required acid is 1:2, in actual applications, generally the acid is excessive to prevent the formation of a diazoamino compound and maintain the stability of the diazonium salt.
Furthermore, some diazo components such as 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline are weak alkaline and insoluble in a dilute acid solution, and only can react in the presence of a more active electrophilic reagent. Thus, a great amount and higher concentration of acid is required as a reaction medium in diazotization reaction of such kind of aromatic primary amines, even the diazotization reaction is directly carried out in a non-aqueous medium of concentrated sulfuric acid. A series of azo disperse dyes suitable for dyeing polyester textile materials and preparation method thereof are disclosed in China Patent CN 1099776A, wherein concentrated sulfuric acid is used as a solvent medium in the diazotization of the 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline monomer. A synthesis process of an azo disperse dye monomer is disclosed in Chinese Patent CN 101117446A, wherein the diazotization of the 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline monomer is also completed in 98% concentrated sulfuric acid.
However, in the diazotization reaction, the use of a great amount and high concentration of acid, especially the highly corrosive, strong oxidative concentrated sulfuric acid medium, will not only lead to a waste of resources and increased costs, but also put forward higher requirements for production equipment's, process operation and control as well as production safety. Meanwhile, the generated large amount of waste water will bring a great threat to the ecological environment. Thus, research and development of a solvent medium which can be used in a mild condition with a low concentration and a small amount of acid have a very important practical significance.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
In order to solve the above technical problems, one object of the invention is to provide a solvent medium for diazotization reaction. The solvent medium has significant phase transfer catalysis, and can effectively reduce the diazotization reaction time to accelerate the process of the diazotization reaction.

Furthermore, by means of the solvent medium, the diazotization reaction has a simple operation process, a low-cost production device as well as high safety, and can reduce the pollution of environment, thus, the solvent medium of the invention make the production more environmentally friendly.
The solvent medium for diazotization reaction of the invention comprises a mixed solution of polyethylene glycol and water, the molecular weight of polyethylene glycol is 200-600, and the volume ratio of polyethylene glycol and water is 1:0.4-1.5.
Preferably, the molecular weight of polyethylene glycol is 200-400, and the volume ratio of polyethylene glycol and water is 1:0.4-1.25.
Preferably, the molecular weight of polyethylene glycol is 400-600, and the volume ratio of polyethylene glycol and water is 1:1.0-1.5.
Preferably, the mixed solution also includes hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, so that the H+ concentration of the mixed solution is 0.32-1.72 mol L−1.
More preferably, the H+ concentration of the mixed solution is 0.35-1.72 mol L−1.
More preferably, the H+ concentration of the mixed solution is 0.32-0.39 mol L−1.
The solvent medium for diazotization reaction of the present invention is a mixed solution of polyethylene glycol and water, the molecular weight of polyethylene glycol is 200-600, and the volume ratio of polyethylene glycol and water is 1:0.4-1.5. Experiments show that, polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 200-600 has significant phase transfer catalysis, and can effectively reduce the diazotization reaction time to accelerate the process of the diazotization reaction. The solvent medium also can effectively prevent the formation of a diazoamino compound and maintain the stability of a diazonium salt, thereby improving the yield of the diazonium salt and ensure the good quality of the diazonium salt. Furthermore, by means of the solvent medium, the diazotization reaction can utilize a simple operation process and a low-cost production device. The polyethylene glycol component in solvent medium is less volatile, non-irritant, non-toxic ecologically, has good solubility and dispersion properties, and can dissolve and disperse the weak alkaline and insoluble diazo components well and thus can effectively achieve the dissolution effects of reactants in concentrated acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid. This will avoid the addition of the high concentration and large amount of acid in diazotization reaction of prior art, especially the highly corrosive, strong oxidative concentrated sulfuric acid medium. Thus, the solvent medium of the invention will not only reduce the waste of resources and production costs, but also simplify the requirements on production equipment's, process operation and control and production safety. Meanwhile, the production process will not produce a lot of acid-containing wastewater and reduce the pollution of the environment, this is more environmentally friendly.
