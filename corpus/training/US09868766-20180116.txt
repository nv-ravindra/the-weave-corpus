It has been found that the present compounds are oxytocin receptor agonists, which compounds are oxytocin analogs that retain oxytocin bioactivity. Such analog molecules are capable of acting in a manner similar to endogenous oxytocin, including binding the oxytocin receptor. Analogs of oxytocin have completely new molecular structures.
Oxytocin is a nine amino acid cyclic peptide hormone with two cysteine residues that form a disulfide bridge between position 1 and 6. Human oxytocin comprises the sequence Cys-Tyr-Ile-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Leu-Gly.
Peptides have emerged as a commercially relevant class of drugs that offer the advantage of greater specifity and potency and lower toxicity profiles over traditional small molecule pharmaceuticals. They offer promising treatment options for numerous diseases, such as diabetes, HIV, hepatitis, cancer and others, with physicians and patents becoming more accepting of peptide-based medicines. The present invention relates to peptidic oxytocin receptor agonists, which also include the natural hormone oxytocin and carbetocin.
Oxytocin is a potent uterotonic agent for the control of uterine atony and excessive bleeding, clinically used to induce labour, and has been shown to enhance the onset and maintenance of lactation (Gimpl et al., Physiol. Rev., 81, (2001), 629-683, Ruis et al., BMJ, 283, (1981), 340-342). Carbetocin (1-deamino-1-carba-2-tyrosine (O-methyl)-oxytocin) is also a potent uterotonic agent clinically used for the control of uterine atony and excessive bleeding.
Peptidic oxytocin agonists may be used for the treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrom, which is a rare genetic disorder which affects one child in 25.000.
Further research indicates that oxytocin agonists are useful for the treatment of inflammation and pain, including abdominal and back pain (Yang, Spine, 19, 1994, 867-71), sexual dysfunction in both male (Lidberg et al., Pharmakopsychiat., 10, 1977, 21-25) and female (Anderson-Hunt, et al., BMJ, 309, 1994, 929), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, Louvel et al., Gut, 39, 1996, 741-47), constipation and gastrointestinal obstruction (Ohlsson et al., Neurogastroenterol. Motil., 17, 2005, 697-704), autism (Hollander et al., Neuropsychopharm., 28, 2008, 193-98), stress, including post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Pitman et al., Psychiatry Research, 48, 107-117), anxiety, including anxiety disorders and depression (Kirsch et al., J. Neurosci., 25, 49, 11489-93, Waldherr et al., PNAS, 104, 2007, 16681-84), surgical blood loss or control of post-partum haemorrhage (Fujimoto et al., Acta Obstet. Gynecol., 85, 2006, 1310-14), labor induction and maintenance (Flamm et al., Obstet. Gynecol., 70, 1987, 70-12), wound healing and infection, mastitis and placenta delivery, and osteoporosis. Additionally, oxytocin agonists may be useful for the diagnosis of both cancer and placental insufficiency.
Furthermore, the Articles “Intranasal Oxytocin blocks alcohol withdrawal in human subjects” (Alcohol Clin Exp Res, Vol, No. 2012) and “Breaking the loop: Oxytocin as a potential treatment for drug addiction” (Hormones and Behavior, 61, 2012, 331-339) propose to treat alcohol withdrawal and drug addiction with a oxytocin agonist.
Oxytocin and its receptors exists in areas of the brain implicated in the symptoms of schizophrenia, such as the nucleus accumbens and the hippocampus. The oxytocin receptor agonists may be used for the treatment of autism, stress, including post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, including anxiety disorders and depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, psychiatric disorders, memory loss and metabolic diseases (WO2012/016229).
Objects of the present invention are novel compounds of formula I and the use of compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts for the treatment of CNS diseases related to the oxytocin receptor, which diseases are autism, stress, including post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, including anxiety disorders and depression, schizophrenia, psychiatric disorders and memory loss, alcohol withdrawal, drug addiction and for the treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrom.
Further objects are the preparation of novel compounds of formula I and medicaments, containing them.
The present invention may provide selective, efficacious compounds, providing alternatives and/or improvements in the treatment of certain CNS diseases including autism, stress, including post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, including anxiety disorders and depression, schizophrenia, psychiatric disorders and memory loss, alcohol withdrawal, drug addiction and for the treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrom.
It has been shown that the present peptides have a very good selectivity to the vasopressin receptors V1a and V2 as shown in the table. This may have a major advantage for use as medicament to avoid side effects. These physiological effects may be considered to be undesirable side effects in the case of medicines aimed at treating diseases of the central nervous system. Therefore it is desirable to obtain medicines having selectivity for the oxytocin receptor vs. vasopressin receptor.

The preparation of compounds of formula I of the present invention may be carried out in sequential or convergent synthetic routes. The skills required for carrying out the reaction and purification of the resulting products are known to those skilled in the art.
The compounds herein were synthesized by standard methods in solid phase peptide chemistry utilizing both Fmoc and Boc methodology. Reactions carried out manually were performed at room temperature, while microwave assisted peptide synthesis was performed at elevated temperature.
General Synthesis Description:
Linear peptides were either synthesized manually or using microwave technology via state-of-the-art solid phase synthesis protocols (Fmoc-chemistry) as referenced by e.g.: Kates and Albericio, Eds., “Solid Phase Synthesis: A practical guide”, Marcel Decker, New York, Basel, 2000. As a solid support TentaGel-S-RAM resin (0.24 meq/g) was used. All Fmoc-amino acids were added in a 10-fold excess after activation with HOBT/HBTU 1:1 (0.5 mol/L in DMF) and 4 eq of DIPEA (2 mol/L in NMP). Fmoc-cleavage was achieved with 20% piperidine in DMF.
Allyl/Aloc-Cleavage & Lactam-Cyclisation:
The resin was treated manually with a solution of 20 eq phenylsilane in DCM and 0.05 eq of tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium for 30 min at RT. This procedure was repeated. The resin was washed with a solution of 0.5% sodium dithiocarbamate in DMF. For the on-bead lactam formation, again activation reagent was added to the resin and shaken for additional 8 h at RT. Completion of cyclisation was verified via Ninhydrin-test. Crude peptides were treated with standard peptide activation regents in DMF. The cyclisation was monitored via HPLC.
Cleavage:
A cleavage-cocktail of trifluoroacetic acid, triisopropylsilane and water (95/2.5/2.5) was added to the resin and shaken for 1 h at RT. Cleaved peptide was precipitated in cold Ether (−18° C.). The peptide was centrifuged and the residue washed twice with cold ether. The residue was dissolved in water/acetonitrile and lyophilized.
Purification:
Peptides were purified using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a Reprospher 100 C18-T Column (100×4.6 mm, 5 u particle size) as a stationary phase and water/acetonitrile as eluent (Gradient 1-50% MeCN over 30 min). Fractions were collected and analyzed by LC/MS. Pure product samples were combined and lyophilized. All peptides were obtained as white powders with a purity >85%. Product identification was obtained via mass spectrometry.
All standard amino acids were purchased from CEM. Fmoc-Glu(Allyl)-OH, Fmoc-Phe(4-NHBoc)-OH, Fmoc-DAP(Aloc)-OH, Fmoc-DAB(Aloc)-OH and Fmoc-SAR-OH were purchased from Bachem. Fmoc-β-Homoproline was purchased from Chem-Impax. Fmoc-β-Ala-OH and Mono-tBu-Succinate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
The detailed description for the synthesis of example 6 is provided to further illustrate the synthesis conditions:
Peptide Synthesis:
The peptide was synthesized using CEM Microwave technology with coupling times of 5 minutes per amino acid at elevated temperature (78° C.) and a 0.25 mmol scale. The synthesis is carried out using the TentalGel-S RAM resin as a solid support (0.24 meq/g). All amino acids used were dissolved in DMF to 0.2 mol concentration. A mixture of HOBT/HBTU 1:1 (0.5 mol/L) 4 eq. and DIPEA 4 eq. was used to activate the amino acids. Fmoc-Cleavage was achieved with Piperidine in DMF (20%) for 3 min. Fmoc-cleavage was repeated.
Aloc-& Allyl-Cleavage:
The resin was treated manually with a solution of 20 eq. phenylsilane and 0.05 eq. of tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium in DCM (5 ml) for 30 min at RT. This procedure was repeated. The resin was washed with a solution of 0.5% sodium dithiocarbamate in DMF twice. The washing step was repeated with DCM.
On-Bead Cyclisation:
Again coupling-reagent (4 ml of an 0.5 mol/L solution HOBT/HBTU (1:1) and 1 ml of DIPEA (4 eq.) in DMF was added to the resin. The slurry was shaken for about 8 h at RT. The resin was washed with DMF and DCM twice. Completion of cyclisation was verified via Ninhydrin test.
Cleavage from Resin:
10 ml of the cleavage-cocktail (TFA; TIS; water (95/2.5/2.5)) was added to the resin and shaken for 1 h at RT. Cleaved peptide was precipitated in cold ether (−18° C.). The peptide was centrifuged and the precipitates washed twice with cold ether. The precipitate was dissolved in H2O/Acetonitrile and lyophilized to yield 210 mg white powder.
Purification:
The crude peptide was purified by preparative HPLC on a Reprospher 100 C18-T Column (100×4.6 mm, Sum particle size). As eluent system a mixture of 0.1% TFA/water/acetonitrile was used with a gradient of 0-50% acetonitrile within 0-30 min. The fractions were collected and checked by analytical HPLC. Fractions containing pure product were combined and lyophilized. 7.2 mg of white powder were obtained.
All other peptides listed below were synthesized accordingly.

Material and Methods
Cell Culture and Stable Clone Production
Chines Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding either the human V1a, the human Oxytocin (OTR) or the humanV2 receptor, the later in combination with the chimeric Gqs5 G protein to redirect the signal to Calcium flux. Stable cells were cloned by limiting dilution to yield monoclonal cell lines expressing either human V1a, human V2+Gqs5 or human OTR receptors and selected based on functional responses detected on a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) detecting Calcium flux in the cell after receptor activation. The stable cell lines were grown in F-12 K Nutrient Mixture (Kaighns Modification), containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% L-glutamate, 200 ug/ml Geneticin at 37° C. in a 10% CO2 incubator at 95% humidity.
Calcium Flux Assays Using Fluorescent Imaging (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader, FLIPR)
On the afternoon before the assay, cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/well into black 96 well plates with clear bottoms to allow cell inspection and fluorescence measurements from the bottom of each well. The density of cells was sufficient to yield a confluent monolayer the next day. Hanks balanced salt solution, without phenol red, containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3) and 2.5 mM probenecid (assay buffer) was prepared fresh for each experiment. Compound dilutions were made using a Beckman Biomek 2000 laboratory automation workstation, in assay buffer containing 1% DMSO. The dye-loading buffer consisted of a final concentration of 2 μM Fluo-4-AM (dissolved in DMSO and pluronic acid) in assay buffer. The existing culture media was removed from the wells and 100 μl of the dye-loading buffer was added to each well and incubated for approximately 60 min at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 incubator at 95% humidity. Once dye-loaded, the cells were washed thoroughly on an Embla cell washer with the assay buffer to remove any unincorporated dye. Exactly 100 μl assay buffer was left in each well.
Each 96 well plate containing dye-loaded cells was placed into the FLIPR machine and the laser intensity set to a suitable level to detect low basal fluorescence. To test compounds as agonists, 25 μl diluted compound was added to the plate 10 seconds into the fluorescent measurements and fluorescent response was recorded for 5 minutes. The fluorescence data was normalized to the endogenous full agonist dose-response set at 100% for the maximum response and 0% for the minimum. Each agonist concentration-response curve was constructed using a four parameter logistic equation with Microsoft Excel XLFit as follows: Y=Minimum+((Maximum−Minimum)/(1+10(Log EC50-X)nH)), where y is the % normalized fluorescence, minimum is the minimum y, maximum is the maximum y, log EC50 is the log10 concentration which produces 50% of the maximum induced fluorescence, x is the log10 of the concentration of the agonist compound and H is the slope of the curve (the Hill Coefficient). The maximum value gives the efficacy of the agonist test compound in percentage. The concentration of agonist that produced a half-maximal response is represented by the EC50 value, the logarithm of which yielded the pEC50 value.
The following EC50 (nM), and efficacy (%) for the specific peptides may be provided, together with comparative data for hV1a and hV2:

The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered preferably transdermal, intranasal, subcutaneous or intra venous (iv).
Transdermal is a route of administration wherein active ingredients are delivered across the skin for systematic distribution. Examples include transdermal patches used for medicine delivery, and transdermal implants used for medical or aesthetic purposes.
Nasal administration can be used to deliver drugs for either local or systemic effects, nasal sprays for local effect are quite common. Peptide drugs may be administered as nasal sprays to avoid drug degradation after oral administration.
Subcutaneous injections are also common for the administration of peptide drugs. An intramuscular injection is the injection of a substance directly into the muscle. It is one of several alternative methods for the administration of medications. It is often used for particular forms of medication that are administered in small amounts. The injections should be given under the skin.
The intravenous route is the infusion of liquid substances directly into a vein. Compared with other routes of administration, the intravenous route is the fastest way to deliver fluids and medications throughout the body.
The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.
Medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert carrier are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for their production, which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I and/or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.
The most preferred indications in accordance with the present invention are those which include disorders of the central nervous system, for example the treatment or prevention of autism, stress, including post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, including anxiety disorders and depression, schizophrenia, psychiatric disorders and memory, loss alcohol withdrawal, drug addiction and for the treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrom.
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, have to be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. The dosage for adults can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day of a compound of general formula I or of the corresponding amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The daily dosage may be administered as single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.
