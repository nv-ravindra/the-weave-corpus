FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention is generally related to pyrazole linked benzimidazole conjugates. The present invention is also generally related to the process for synthesis of one or more compounds having a pyrazole linked benzimidazole conjugate. More particularly the present invention is generally related to the biological evaluation of these compounds having a pyrazole linked benzimidazole conjugate as potential anticancer agents.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Microtubules are dynamic polymers of α and β-tubulin present in the Eukaryotic cells that play an important role in most of the fundamental cellular processes such as cell division, motility, transport, and maintenance of cell shape. Colchicines (S1), combretastatin (S2) nocodazole (S3) and podophyllotoxins (S4) are the distinguished compounds that inhibit microtubule assembly by binding at colchicine binding site of the tubulin. Benzimidazole scaffold is the most privileged structure in the field of medicinal chemistry and this residue is a constituent of vitamin B12 that further supports its potential for their development as therapeutic agents. Recently high-throughput virtual screening was performed wherein 2-aryl benzimidazoles were identified as multi-target EGFR, VEGFR-2 and PDGFR inhibitors with improved therapeutic efficacies. (Li Y, Tan C, Gao C, Zhang C, Luan X, Chen X, Liu H, Chen Y, Jiang Y. Discovery of benzimidazole derivatives as novel multi-target EGFR, VEGFR-2 and PDGFR kinase inhibitors. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2011 19, (15), 4529-4535). A recent report suggests that terphenyl benzimidazoles inhibit the tubulin polymerization with arrest in G2/M phase of cell cycle. (Kamal A, Reddy M K, Shaik T B, Rajender, Srikanth Y V, Reddy V S, Kumar G B, Kalivendi S V. Synthesis of terphenyl benzimidazoles as tubulin polymerization inhibitors. Eur. J. Med. Chem, 2012, 50, 9-17). On other hand the pyrazole derivatives received considerable attention owing to their diverse chemotherapeutic potentials including versatile antineoplastic activities and some pyrazoles have been developed as antitumor and antiproliferative agents, they exert anticancer activity by inhibiting different types of enzymes that play major role in cell division. (El-Dakdouki M H, Adamski N, Foster L, Hacker M P, Erhardt P W. Hypoxia activated prodrugs of a 9-aza-anthrapyrazole derivative that has promising anticancer activity. J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54, (23), 8224-8227). Moreover tri and tetra substituted pyrazole derivates have been proved to have potent anticancer action due to the inhibition of p38α MAP kinase (Abu Thaher B, Arnsmann M, Totzke F, Ehlert J E, Kubbutat M H, Schächtele C, Zimmermann M O, Koch P, Boeckler F M, Laufer S A. Tri- and tetrasubstituted pyrazole derivates: regioisomerism switches activity from p38MAP kinase to important cancer kinases. J. Med. Chem. 2012, 55, (2), 961-965). Many reports suggest that methoxy substituents of combretastatin play a major role in the tubulin depolymerisation process by binding at colchicine binding site, thus incorporating such a component has been utilized extensively to design the pharmacophore that target tubulin (Congiu C, Onnis V, Vesci L, Castorina M, Pisano C. Synthesis and in vitro antitumor activity of new 4,5-dihydropyrazole derivatives. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2010, 18, (17), 6238-6248). The exceptional feature of microtubule-binding agents, in comparison to other categories of anticancer drugs, is their incredible structural complexity and diversity, which provides many possibilities for new scaffold design. Recently, many studies suggested that combination chemotherapy with the drugs that could work by different mechanism. Therefore, conjugates of pyrazole and benzimidazole have been designed to evaluate anticancer activity that could be beneficial for the treatment of cancer.
However, there still remains a need in the industry for effective and novel anticancer drugs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION
The present invention is directed at pyrazole-benzimidazole conjugates of Formula A:
wherein substituent R1 in Formula A is chosen from H, Cl, F, CH3, OCH3 and 3,4(OCH2O);
wherein substituent R2 in Formula A is chosen from H, Cl, F, CH3, OCH3 and 3,4(OCH2O);
wherein substituent R3 in Formula A is chosen from H, Cl, F, CH3, OCH3 and 3,4(OCH2O);
wherein substituent R4 in Formula A is chosen from H, Cl, F, CH3, OCH3 and 3,4(OCH2O);
wherein substituent R5 in Formula A is chosen from H, Cl, F, CH3, OCH3 and 3,4(OCH2O);
wherein substituent X1 in Formula A is chosen from H, Br, Cl, F, CH3, OCH3, NO2 and CF3; and
wherein substituent X2 in Formula A is chosen from H, Br, Cl, F, CH3, and CF3.
The synthesis of pyrazole-benzimidazole conjugates of Formula A are outlined in Scheme 1:
In Scheme 1, substituents R1, R2, R3, R4 and/or R5 are chosen from H, Cl, F, CH3, OCH3 and 3,4(OCH2O). Also, substituent X1 of the pyrazole-benzimidazole conjugate is chosen from H, Br, Cl, F, CH3, OCH3, NO2 and CF3, and substituent X2 of the pyrazole-benzimidazole conjugate is chosen from H, Br, Cl, F, CH3, and CF3.
The final step in Scheme 1 can comprise oxidative cyclization of o-phenylenediamines of formulae 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 3-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-5-carbaldehydes of formulae 5(a-n) with sodium metabisulphite in ethanol/methanol solvent system at a temperature of about 85° C. for about 3 hours to about 4 hours. wherein substituents R1, R2, R3, R4 and/or R5 in formulae 5(a-n) are chosen from H, Cl, F, CH3, OCH3 and 3,4(OCH2O).
According to certain aspects of the present invention, the reagents, conditions and (yields) of steps (i) to (v) of Scheme 1 are:
(i) NaOEt, EtOH for about 4h at a temperature of about 0° C. to about 21° C. (85-90%);
(ii) NH2-NH2.2HCl, EtOH at about 3 h, reflux, (72-79%);
(iii) LiAlH4, THF, for about 1 to about 2 hours at a temperature of about 0° C. to about 21° C., (70-80%);
(iv) IBX, dry DMSO, at about 1 hour at about room temperate, (80-90%); and
(v) Na2S2O5, EtOH, o-phenylenediamines, at about 3 hours to about 4 hours at a about room temperature (70-80%).
The key intermediates 3-substituted phenyl-1H-pyrazole-5-carbaldehydes having formulae 5(a-n) in Scheme 1 can be prepared in four sequential steps. Initially substituted acetophenones 1(a-n) reacted with diethyl oxalate in the presence of sodium ethanolate in ethanol yielded ethyl 2,4-dioxo-4-(substituted phenyl)butanoates 2(a-n). This was further cyclised with NH2-NH2.2HCl in ethanol to produce ethyl 3-substituted phenyl-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylates 3(a-n) in good yields. The obtained carboxylates were reduced to (3-substituted phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl) methanols 4(a-n) by LiAlH4/THF. These were selectively oxidized to 3-substituted phenyl-1H-pyrazole-5-carbaldehydes by IBX in DMSO.
Each 3-substituted phenyl-1H-pyrazole-5-carbaldehydes (5a-n) (1.0 mmol) were added to substituted o-phenylenediamines (formulae 1-10) (1.0 mmol) in ethanol (10 mL). A catalytic amount of Na2S2O5 (5 mg) was also charged to the reaction mixture and stirred at a temperature of 85° C. for 3-4 h. The reaction progress was monitored by TLC. After completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature with the addition of water (100 mL) followed by extraction with ethyl acetate (3×30 mL). The organic layers were washed with water, brine solution and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent under vacuum yielded the crude product that was further purified by column chromatography using ethyl acetate/hexane solvent system.
In particular, the pyrazole-benzimidazole conjugates of Formula A prepared by the process outlined in Scheme 1 can be chosen from

Cytotoxic activity: The human cancer cell line assays for some representative compounds were carried out at the National Cancer Institute, Maryland, USA.
The pyrazole linked benzimidazole conjugates (6f, 6g, 7g, 8f, 9f and 10f) have been tested against fifty six human tumor cell lines derived from nine cancer types (leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer, colon cancer, CNS cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer) as per the NCI protocol. For each compound, dose response curves for individual cell lines have been measured at a minimum of five concentrations at 10 fold dilutions. A protocol of 48 h continuous drug exposure has been used, and a sulforhodamine B (SRB) protein assay was used to estimate cell viability or growth. Nocodazole was used as standard and the Log 10 GI50 values have been reported in the table 1. The concentration for 50% cell growth inhibition (GI50) (Growth Inhibition) total cell growth inhibition (TGI, 0% growth) (Total Growth Inhibition), and 50% cell death (LC50, 50% growth) (Lethal concentration) values were tabulated (Table-1). DMSO used as control to calculate the values of GI50, LC50, TGI. The compounds 6f, 6g, 7g, 8f, 9f and 10f has been evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity in fifty six cell lines from nine human cancer types of leukemia (K-562, SR), lung (Hop-62, NCI-H226, NCI-H522), colon (HCT-116, HCT-15, HCC-2998), CNS (SF-539), melanoma (SK-MEL-5, UACC-62, M14), ovarian (IGROV1), renal (A498), prostate (PC3) breast (BT-549, MDA-MB-435, HS578T) origin. The results are expressed as percent of cell growth determined relative to that of untreated control cells (Table 2). The representative compounds 6f, 6g, 7g, 8f, 9f and 10f showed significant anticancer activity against some cancer cell lines.  TABLE 1
