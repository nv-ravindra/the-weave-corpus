TECHNICAL FIELD
Provided are certain agents that inhibit Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), and methods of making and using such agents.
BACKGROUND
Protein kinases are a large multigene family consisting of more than 500 proteins which play a critical role in the development and treatment of a number of human diseases in oncology, neurology and immunology. The Tec kinases are non-receptor tyrosine kinases which consists of five members (Tec (tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma), Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase), Itk (interleukin-2 (IL-2)-inducible T-cell kinase; also known as Emt or Tsk), Rlk (resting lymphocyte kinase; also known as Txk) and Bmx (bone-marrow tyrosine kinase gene on chromosome X; also known as Etk)) and are primarily expressed in haematopoietic cells, although expression of Bmx and Tec has been detected in endothelial and liver cells. Tec kinases (Itk, Rlk and Tec) are expressed in T cell and are all activated downstream of the T-cell receptor (TCR). Btk is a downstream mediator of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling which is involved in regulating B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. More specifically, Btk contains a PH domain that binds phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 binding induces Btk to phosphorylate phospholipase C (PLCy), which in turn hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce two secondary messengers, inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which activate protein kinase PKC, which then induces additional B-cell signaling. Mutations that disable Btk enzymatic activity result in XLA syndrome (X-linked agammaglobulinemia), a primary immunodeficiency. Given the critical roles which Tec kinases play in both B-cell and T-cell signaling, Tec kinases are targets of interest for autoimmune disorders.
Consequently, there is a great need in the art for effective inhibitors of Btk.

The purified compound 27 (950 g) and EtOH (5 L) were vigorously stirred for 4 h and the slurry was filtered and washed with 1 L EtOH. The resulting wet cake was dried under vacuum at 45° C. for ˜24 h until reaching a constant weight to afford crystalline Form A (960 g, yield 85.7%, purity 99%).
300.2 mg of crystalline Form A was weighed into a 20 mL glass vial followed by addition of 6 mL of isopropyl acetate (IPAc) for suspension. The sample was magnetically stirred at 50° C. with a rate of ˜1000 rpm for three days. Solids were isolated by filtration after three days and then dried at room temperature under vacuum for about 5 h to yield crystalline Form G.
Alternatively, to 2.1 g of crystallinze Form A was charged 15 volumes of dichloromethane (mL/g). Distill the resulting mixture under atmospheric conditions using a Dean-Stark trap under the conditions of Tj−Tr=20 K and Tjmax=110° C., wherein Tj=jacket temperature, Tr=reaction/reactor temperature and Tjmax=max jacket temperature. 5 mL or 2 volumes of dichloromethane was removed, followed by addition of 2 volumes of isopropyl acetate (IPAc). Continue to distill under the conditions of Tj−Tr=40K and Tjmax=110° C. until 10 mL or 5 volumes of the solvent(s) was removed. 5 volumes of IPAc was then added, followed by continued distillation to remove another 10 mL or 5 volumes of the solvent(s). 5 volumes of IPAc was added followed by an additional 30 mL of IPAc. The resulting mixture was stirred and temperature was cycled over the weekend between 20° C. to 60° C. to form a slurry and Form G was isolated from the slurry.
Powder X-Ray Diffraction
Crystallinity of the compound was studied using a XRD-D8 X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (Bruker, Madison, Wis.). The instrument is equipped with a long fine focus X-ray tube. The tube voltage and amperage were set to 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The divergence and scattering slits were set at 10 and the receiving slit was set at 0.15 mm. Diffracted radiation was detected by a Lynxeye detector. A 0-20 continuous scan at 1.6°/min from 3 to 42° 2θ was used. The sample was prepared for analysis by placing it on a zero background plate.
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of crystalline Form A is shown in FIG. 1 and the main peaks are listed in Table 1. The PXRD pattern of crystalline Form G is shown in FIG. 4 and the main peaks are listed in Table 2.  TABLE 1

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
Thermal properties of the compound were examined using a Discovery Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) (TA Instruments) and a Discovery Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) (TA Instruments). Sample was enclosed in a closed aluminum DSC pan for DSC analysis and in an open aluminum pan for TGA analysis. The thermal analysis was performed with a linear gradient from 25° C. to 300° C. at 10° C. per minute for both DSC and TGA studies. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis for crystalline Form A shows that Form A has an onset temperature at 175.6° C. and a melting temperature at 186° C. ( FIG. 2 ).
The DSC analysis for crystalline Form G shows that Form G has an onset temperature at 215.4° C. and a melting temperature at 217.3° C. ( FIG. 5 ).
The TGA analysis for Form A of compound 27 shows a 3.16% weight loss, indicating Form A is a hydrate ( FIG. 3 ).
The TGA analysis of Form G of compound 27 shows no weight loss until the melt, indicating that Form G is anhydrous ( FIG. 5 ).
Solid State NMR
The 13C CP/MAS (Cross polarization/magic angle spinning) solid-state NMR spectra were acquired on a 363 MHz Tecmag Redstone spectrometer by Spectral Data Services of Champaign, Ill. Each sample was packed into a 7 mm (OD) zirconia rotor closed with kel-F end caps for subsequent data acquisition. All three samples were about half full in the rotor. The 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra were acquired on the Doty XC 7 mm CP/MAS probe at an observing frequency of 91 MHz (spin 7 kHz, 1H pulse width 5.0 μs, spectral width 29.8 kHz, acquisition time 0.0344 sec, CP pulse width 2 ms, relaxation delay 5.0 sec, number of scans 1296). Spectra were referenced to the chemical shift of external sample of glycine carbonyl carbon at 176 ppm and processed using Nuts (line broadening of 10 Hz). The peak listing and overlay of spectra are processed using MNOVA.
13C CP/MAS solid state NMR for Form A and Form G are shown in FIG. 3B and FIG. 6B , respectively. Diagnostic chemical shifts are listed in Table 3.  TABLE 3

Example 155. In Vitro BTK Kinase Assay: BTK-POLYGAT-LS ASSAY
The purpose of the BTK in vitro assay is to determine compound potency against BTK through the measurement of IC50. Compound inhibition is measured after monitoring the amount of phosphorylation of a fluorescein-labeled polyGAT peptide (Invitrogen PV3611) in the presence of active BTK enzyme (Upstate 14-552), ATP, and inhibitor. The BTK kinase reaction was done in a black 96 well plate (costar 3694). For a typical assay, a 24 pL aliquot of a ATP/peptide master mix (final concentration; ATP 10 μM, polyGAT 100 nM) in kinase buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 μM Na3PO4, 5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mg/ml casein) is added to each well. Next, I pL of a 4-fold, 40× compound titration in 100% DMSO solvent is added, followed by adding 15 uL of BTK enzyme mix in 1× kinase buffer (with a final concentration of 0.25 nM). The assay is incubated for 30 minutes before being stopped with 28 pL of a 50 mM EDTA solution. Aliquots (5 uL) of the kinase reaction are transferred to a low volume white 384 well plate (Coming 3674), and 5 pL of a 2× detection buffer (Invitrogen PV3574, with 4 nM Tb-PY20 antibody, Invitrogen PV3552) is added. The plate is covered and incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature. Time resolved fluorescence (TRF) on Molecular Devices M5 (332 nm excitation; 488 nm emission; 518 nm fluorescein emission) is measured. IC50 values are calculated using a four parameter fit with 100% enzyme activity determined from the DMSO control and 0% activity from the EDTA control.

Example 156. In Vitro PD Assay in Human Whole Blood
Human heparinized venous blood was purchased from Bioreclamation, Inc. or SeraCare Life Sciences and shipped overnight. Whole blood was aliquoted into 96-well plate and “spiked” with serial dilutions of test compound in DMSO or with DMSO without drug. The final concentration of DMSO in all wells was 0.1%. The plate was incubated at 37° C. for 30 min. Lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors was added to the drug-containing samples and one of the DMSO-only samples (+PPi, high control), while lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors was added to the other DMSO-only samples (−PPi, low control). All of the lysed whole blood samples were subjected to the total BTK capture and phosphotyrosine detection method described in US20160311802, incorporated herein by reference. ECL values were graphed in Prism and a best-fit curve with restrictions on the maximum and minimum defined by the +PPi high and −PPi low controls was used to estimate the test compound concentration that results in 50% inhibition of ECL signal by interpolation.
