FIELD
The present disclosure generally relates to the synthesis of 3-substituted phenylalkylamines via a catalytic asymmetric 1,4-addition reaction.
BACKGROUND
Tapentadol (i.e., 3-[(1R, 2R)-3-(dimethyamino)-1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl] phenol) is a small organic molecule that is used as an analgesic. Tapentadol is known to have a dual mechanism of action as an agonist of the μ-opioid receptor and also as a norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor (NRI) for improved analgesic efficacy especially in chronic or neuropathic pain disorders.
Several different routes for preparing tapentadol have been reported. A typical method is to produce a racemic mixture of intermediates that must be separated by chiral chromatographic separation or by chiral resolution. The separation of chiral compounds, however, can be technically challenging, time consuming, or both.
There are a few asymmetric syntheses for the preparation of tapentadol that do not require chiral separation or chiral resolution, but rather relies on a direct asymmetric synthesis of chiral compounds. These syntheses can be moderately efficient. Yet, these syntheses consist of multiple reaction steps and have protection/deprotection steps of functional groups within the synthesis. Developing a more expedite synthetic process where no protecting groups are utilized or where a synthetic step is coupled with a deprotection step would provide a shorter synthesis, reduced cost, and a time savings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The present disclosure provides a concise process for preparing a substituted 3-substituted phenylalkylamines. In general, the process consists of a two-step process. The first step of the process involves a catalytic asymmetric 1,4-addition reaction of an α-substituted α,β-unsaturated carbonyl-containing compound with a phenyl boronic compound. Reductive alkylation as the second step provides a concise route to the 3-substituted phenylalkylamines. Alternatively, using a reduction procedure which performs reductive alkylation and removal of a protecting group provides a second concise route to 3-substituted phenyl alkyl amines. Surprisingly, these reaction sequences have been found useful in the total synthesis of tapentadol.
Compared to other conventional methods, the more concise routes presented provides a reduction in reaction steps, an increase in yield, increase in selectivity, and a time savings.

The following examples are included to demonstrate embodiments of the disclosure. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples represent techniques discovered by the inventors to function well in the practice of the disclosure. Those of skill in the art should, however, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes may be made in the specific embodiments that are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure; therefore all matter set forth is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
The following examples exemplify the two-step process.
Example 1: Preparation of (2R, 3R)-(3-Hydroxyphenyl)-2-methylpentanal
Trans-2-methyl-2-pentenal and 3-hydroxyphenylboronic acid were reacted in the presence of a proton acceptor and amine via catalytic asymmetric 1,4-addition reaction.
3-Hydroxyphenylboronic acid (3.64 g, 26.3 mmol) was charged to a flask and stirred under nitrogen. Degassed methanol (8.00 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred under nitrogen to completely dissolve the solids. Into a second flask was added di-μ-chlorotetraethylene dirhodium(I) (13.1 mg, 0.0336 mmol), (1S,4S)-2,5-diphenylbicyclo [2,2,2]octa-2,5-diene, (19.1 mg, 0.0739 mmol) and D-sorbitol (4.80 g, 26.3) were charged and stirred under nitrogen. Degassed methanol (6.00 mL) and trans-2-methyl-2-pentenal (3.50 mL, 30.66 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred under nitrogen for sixty minutes. Degassed distilled water (8.00 mL) was added and the mixture was warmed from 20.8° C. to 40° C. with stirring under nitrogen over 28 minutes. 4-Methylmorpholine (0.600 mL, 5.45 mmol) was then added followed by the 3-hydroxyphenylboronic acid solution. The solution was stirred at 40° C. for eight hours. Analytical analysis revealed that the reaction contained 6.7% of the undesired isomer and 65% of the desired product.

The Parr bottle may be further deoxygenated three additional times with vacuum and nitrogen then hydrogen gas (40 psi) may be introduced. The reaction may be warmed to 40° C. and stirred for approximately 6 h. After cooling the reaction to room temperature and venting the Parr bottle with nitrogen, the reaction mixture may be filtered to remove the catalyst through a fritted funnel. The funnel may then be rinsed with methanol (20 mL). To the filtrate, toluene (50 mL) and 25% aqueous sodium hydroxide may be to raise the pH to 10.0.

The reaction may be warmed to room temperature and may be stirred overnight at room temperature. Saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (100 mL) may then be slowly added to quench the reaction. After stirring for 1 hour, the quenched reaction mixture may be extracted with CHCl3 (3×50 mL), the extracts may be combined, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated yielding tapentadol base (13.47 g, 90% yield) as an oil.

The mixture was thoroughly mixed, then allowed to settle. The organic layer was separated. Analytical analysis revealed that the ratio of desired to undesired diastereomers was 83:17.
Example 3c: Preparation of (2R,3R)-3-(3-Benzyloxyphenyl)-2-methyl-pentanal
Flask 1, Catalyst. Di-μ-chlorotetraethylene dirhodium(I) (126.2 mg, 0.324 mmol) and (1S,4S)-2,5-diphenylbicyclo[2,2,2]octa-2,5-diene (190.3 mg, 0.737 mmol), were stirred under nitrogen. Flask 2: Enal. Triethylamine (1.22 mL, 8.75 mmol), trans-2-methyl-2-pentenal (6.7 mL, 58.7 mmol) and methanol (10 mL) were heated at reflux under nitrogen for 30 minutes to remove air, and then cooled to room temperature. Flask 3, Phenylboronic acid. 3-Benzyloxyphenylboronic acid (10.00 g, 43.85 mmol) and methanol (20 mL) were stirred to a solution and heated at reflux under nitrogen for 30 minutes to remove air, then cooled to room temperature. The contents of reaction flask 1 were cooled in an ice bath under a nitrogen atmosphere. The contents of flask 2 (enal) were added dropwise with stirring over five minutes into flask 1 under a nitrogen atmosphere, resulting in a red solution that was stirred in the ice bath for one hour. Then, the contents of flask 3 (phenylboronic acid) were added dropwise with stirring over 112 minutes to the mixture comprising flasks 1 and 2 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Following the addition, the entire reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for two hours. After two hours, analysis revealed 90.4% conversion and 81.0% selectivity. The reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of a solution of calcium chloride (4.87 g) in methanol (20 mL). Toluene (50 mL) was added and the mixture was washed with distilled water (1×50 mL, then 3×20 mL). The toluene layer (82.4% selectivity) was vacuum stripped from 55.6 g to 14.2 g. Methanol (50 mL) was charged and the solution was vacuum stripped from 52.4 g to 11.2 g. Methanol (50 mL) was added (solution mass 48.2 g). The product was not isolated and used directly in the reductive alkylation reaction.
Example 4: Preparation of 3-[(1R, 2R)-3-(dimethyamino)-1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl] phenol (Tapentadol Base)
(2R,3R)-3-(3-Benzyloxyphenyl)-2-methyl-pentenal and dimethylamine was reacted with a transition metal catalyst and an alternative hydrogen source to form (2R,3R)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N,N-2-trimethylpentan-1-amine (tapentadol base).
Potassium formate (14.0 g, 166.4 mmol) and dimethylamine hydrochloride (10.9 g, 133.6 mmol) were stirred in methanol (50 mL). Triethylamine (23 mL, 165 mmol) was added and the mixture was cooled in an ice-bath. 88% Formic acid (14.3 g, 273.4 mmol) was added dropwise, maintaining the temperature below 22° C. Once the addition is complete, the mixture was warmed to 20° C. 5% Palladium/carbon catalyst, 50% wet (5.00 g) was added. To this mixture was added approximately one half of the methanol solution from Example 3c (˜21.92 mmol) dropwise over seven minutes. Following addition, the mixture was warmed to 40° C. then stirred for four hours. Analysis of a reaction sample indicated that the reaction was complete (no starting material remained). The mixture was filtered to remove the palladium catalyst. To the filtrate were added toluene (50 mL) and 25% aqueous sodium hydroxide to raise the pH from 7.1 to 10.0. The mixture was thoroughly stirred, and then allowed the settle. Separation of the organic layer followed by evaporation yielded tapentadol (99.0% conversion, 76.7% selectivity).
