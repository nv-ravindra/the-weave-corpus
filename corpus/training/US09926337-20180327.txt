FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to novel asymmetric urea compounds, medical uses thereof, particularly in the treatment of medical conditions modulated by the ghrelin receptor.
BACKGROUND
The growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) regulates a number of physiological processes, including growth hormone (GH) release, metabolism, and appetite. Ghrelin, a circulating hormone produced predominantly by endocrine cells in the stomach, is its endogenous ligand. Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid peptide with an acyl side chain required for biological activity (Kojima et al., Nature, 402, 656-660, 1999). Ghrelin has been shown to stimulate growth hormone (GH) release and to increase food intake when administered both centrally and peripherally (Wren et al., Endocrinology, 141, 4325-4328, 2000).
Endogenous levels of ghrelin rise on fasting and fall on re-feeding in humans (Cummings et al., Diabetes, 50, 1714-1719, 2001). Ghrelin also appears to play a role in maintaining long term energy balance and appetite regulation. Chronic administration of ghrelin in rodents leads to hyperphagia and weight gain that are independent of growth hormone secretion (Tschop et al., Nature, 407, 908-913, 2000). Circulating ghrelin levels decrease in response to chronic overfeeding and increase in response to chronic negative energy balance associated with anorexia or exercise. Obese people generally have low plasma ghrelin levels (Tschop et al., Diabetes, 50, 707-709, 2001) accordingly to the physiological response of the body in reducing calories intake. Intravenous ghrelin is effective in stimulating food intake in humans. A recent study showed a 28% food intake increase from a buffet meal with a ghrelin infusion compared with saline control (Wren et al., J. Clin. Endocrinology and Metabolism, 86, 5992, 2001).
In view of the above experimental evidence, compounds that modulate ghrelin receptor activity have been proposed for preventing and/or treating disorders associated with ghrelin receptor physiology. For example, antagonists at ghrelin receptor might one day be developed to reduce appetite, reduce food intake, induce weight loss and treat obesity without affecting or reducing the circulating growth hormone levels. On the other hand, agonists at ghrelin receptor might also be developed for stimulating food intake and thus be useful in treating eating disorders, for example anorexia nervosa, or in treating cachexia resulting from cancer, AIDS or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Ghrelin agonists may also be useful as gastroprokinetic agents which can enhance gastrointestinal motility by increasing the frequency of contractions in the small intestine or making them stronger, but without disrupting their rhythm. Gastroprokinetic agents are used to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, bloating, constipation, heart burn, nausea, and vomiting, and are used to treat a number of gastrointestinal disorders, including but not limiting to, irritable bowel syndrome, gastritis, acid reflux disease, gastroparesis, and functional dyspepsia. Furthermore, compounds that modulate ghrelin receptor activity might also be used to prevent or treat diseases related to substance abuse, for example, alcohol or drug (e.g., amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methaqualone, and opioids) abuse, which refers to a maladaptive pattern of use of a substance that is not considered dependent.
A number of compounds acting on the ghrelin receptor have been reported in the literature. YIL-781, for example, is a small molecule ghrelin receptor antagonist from Bayer that reportedly improves glucose tolerance, suppresses appetite and promotes weigh loss (Esler et al., Endocrinology 148 (11):5175-5185); LY444711 is an orally active ghrelin receptor agonist from Lilly that reportedly induces adiposity by stimulating food consumption and sparing fat utilization (Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett., 2004, 14, 5873-5876); anamorelin is an orally available ghrelin receptor small molecule agonist from Helsinn Therapeutics that is in clinical trials for the treatment of anorexia and cachexia in cancer patients. Ghrelin receptor agonists and antagonists based on asymmetric ureas are disclosed in US 2012/0220629, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other small molecule ghrelin receptor modulators can be found in WO 2008/092681, US 2009/0253673, WO 2008/148853, WO 2008/148856, US 2007/0270473 and US 2009/0186870.
In view of the above, it is desirable to find new compounds which modulate ghrelin receptor activity.

At various places in the present specification, substituents of compounds of the invention are disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the invention include each and every individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges. For example, the term ‚ÄúC1-6 alkyl‚Äù is specifically intended to individually disclose methyl, ethyl, C3 alkyl, C4 alkyl, C5 alkyl, and C6 alkyl.
For compounds of the invention in which a variable appears more than once, each variable can be a different moiety selected from the Markush group defining the variable. For example, where a structure is described having two R groups that are simultaneously present on the same compound; the two R groups can represent different moieties selected from the Markush group defined for R.
It is further appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, can also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, can also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination.
As used herein, the term ‚Äúalkyl‚Äù is meant to refer to a saturated hydrocarbon group which is straight-chained or branched. Example alkyl groups include methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), propyl (e.g., n-propyl and isopropyl), butyl (e.g., n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl), pentyl (e.g., n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl), and the like. An alkyl group can contain from 1 to about 20, from 2 to about 20, from 1 to about 10, from 1 to about 8, from 1 to about 6, from 1 to about 4, or from 1 to about 3 carbon atoms.
As used herein, ‚Äúalkenyl‚Äù refers to an alkyl group having one or more double carbon-carbon bonds. Example alkenyl groups include ethenyl, propenyl, cyclohexenyl, and the like.
As used herein, ‚Äúalkynyl‚Äù refers to an alkyl group having one or more triple carbon-carbon bonds. Example alkynyl groups include ethynyl, propynyl, and the like.
As used herein, ‚Äúhaloalkyl‚Äù refers to an alkyl group having one or more halogen substituents. Example haloalkyl groups include CF3, C2F5, CHF2, CCl3, CHCI2, C2CI5, and the like.
As used herein, ‚Äúhydroxylalkyl‚Äù refers to an alkyl group having one or more OH substituents. Example hydroxyalkyl groups include CH2OH, C2CH4OH, C3H6OH, and the like.
As used herein, ‚Äúaryl‚Äù refers to monocyclic or polycyclic (e.g., having 2, 3 or 4 fused rings) aromatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, indanyl, indenyl, and the like. In some embodiments, aryl groups have from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms.
As used herein, ‚Äúcycloalkyl‚Äù refers to non-aromatic carbocycles including cyclized alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups. Cycloalkyl groups can include mono- or polycyclic (e.g., having 2, 3 or 4 fused rings) ring systems as well as spiro ring systems. Example cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, cycloheptatrienyl, norbornyl, norpinyl, norcarnyl, adamantyl, and the like. Also included in the definition of cycloalkyl are moieties that have one or more aromatic rings fused (i.e., having a bond in common with) to the cycloalkyl ring, for example, benzo derivatives of pentane, pentene, hexane, and the like. In some embodiments, cycloalkyl groups can have from about 3 to about 10, or about 3 to about 7 ring-forming carbon atoms.
As used herein, ‚Äúheterocyclyl‚Äù or ‚Äúheterocycle‚Äù refers to a saturated or unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon wherein one or more of the ring-forming carbon atoms of the cyclic hydrocarbon is replaced by a heteroatom such as O, S, or N. Heterocyclyl groups can be aromatic (e.g., ‚Äúheteroaryl‚Äù) or non-aromatic (e.g., ‚Äúheterocycloalkyl‚Äù). Heterocyclyl groups can also correspond to hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated heteroaryl groups. Heterocyclyl groups can include mono- or polycyclic (e.g., having 2, 3 or 4 fused rings) ring systems. Heterocyclyl groups can be characterized as having 3-14 or 3-7 ring-forming atoms.

A ‚Äúpharmaceutically acceptable‚Äù excipient is one that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material can be administered to a subject without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical composition in which it is contained. The carrier can be selected to minimize any degradation of the active ingredient and to minimize any adverse side effects in the subject, as would be well known to one of skill in the art. The carrier can be a solid, a liquid, or both.
The disclosed compounds can be administered by any suitable route, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment or prevention intended. The active compounds and compositions, for example, can be administered orally, rectally, parenterally, ocularly, inhalationaly, or topically. In particular, administration can be epicutaneous, inhalational, enema, conjunctival, eye drops, ear drops, alveolar, nasal, intranasal, vaginal, intravaginal, transvaginal, ocular, intraocular, transocular, enteral, oral, intraoral, transoral, intestinal, rectal, intrarectal, transrectal, injection, infusion, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intracerebral, intraventricular, intracerebroventricular, intracardiac, subcutaneous, intraosseous, intradermal, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, intravesical, intracavernosal, intramedullar, intraocular, intracranial, transdermal, transmucosal, transnasal, inhalational, intracisternal, epidural, peridural, intravitreal, etc.
Suitable carriers and their formulations are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (19th ed.) ed. A. R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1995. Oral administration of a solid dose form can be, for example, presented in discrete units, such as hard or soft capsules, pills, cachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of at least one of the disclosed compound or compositions. In some forms, the oral administration can be in a powder or granule form. In some forms, the oral dose form is sublingual, such as, for example, a lozenge. In such solid dosage forms, the compounds of Formula I are ordinarily combined with one or more adjuvants. Such capsules or tablets can contain a controlled-release formulation. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms also can comprise buffering agents or can be prepared with enteric coatings.
In some forms, oral administration can be in a liquid dose form. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art (e.g., water). Such compositions also can comprise adjuvants, such as wetting, emulsifying, suspending, flavoring (e.g., sweetening), and/or perfuming agents.
In some forms, the disclosed compositions can comprise a parenteral dose form. ‚ÄúParenteral administration‚Äù includes, for example, subcutaneous injections, intravenous injections, intraperitoneally, intramuscular injections, intrasternal injections, and infusion. Injectable preparations (e.g., sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions) can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing, wetting agents, and/or suspending agents. Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier include, but are not limited to, saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. Other acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to, thickeners, diluents, buffers, preservatives, surface active agents and the like.

8. Obesity
Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health, leading to reduced life expectancy and/or increased health problems. Obesity treatment includes inducing weight loss, reducing bodyweight, reducing food intake, reducing appetite, increasing metabolic rate, reducing fat intake, reducing carbohydrate craving; or inducing satiety. The obesity-related disorders herein are associated with, caused by, or result from obesity. Examples of obesity-related disorders include overeating, binge eating, and bulimia, hypertension, diabetes, elevated plasma insulin concentrations and insulin resistance, dyslipidemias, hyperlipidemia, endometrial, breast, prostate and colon cancer, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, cholelithiasis, gallstones, heart disease, abnormal heart rhythms and arrythmias, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, sudden death, stroke, polycystic ovary disease, craniopharyngioma, the Prader-Willi Syndrome, Frohlich's syndrome, GH-deficient subjects, normal variant short stature, Turner's syndrome, and other pathological conditions showing reduced metabolic activity or a decrease in resting energy expenditure as a percentage of total fat-free mass, e.g, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Further examples of obesity-related disorders are metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance syndrome, sexual and reproductive dysfunction, such as infertility, hypogonadism in males and hirsutism in females, gastrointestinal motility disorders, such as obesity-related gastro-esophageal reflux, respiratory disorders, such as obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), cardiovascular disorders, inflammation, such as systemic inflammation of the vasculature, arteriosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricaemia, lower back pain, gallbladder disease, gout, and kidney cancer, nicotine addiction, substance addiction and alcoholism.

10. Congestive Heart Failure
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a condition in which the heart's function as a pump to deliver oxygen rich blood to the body is inadequate to meet the body's needs. Congestive heart failure can be caused by diseases that weaken the heart muscle, or diseases that cause stiffening of the heart muscles, or diseases that increase oxygen demand by the body tissue beyond the capability of the heart to deliver. Many diseases can impair the pumping action of the ventricles. For example, the muscles of the ventricles can be weakened by heart attacks or infections (myocarditis). The diminished pumping ability of the ventricles due to muscle weakening is called systolic dysfunction. After each ventricular contraction (systole) the ventricle muscles need to relax to allow blood from the atria to fill the ventricles. This relaxation of the ventricles is called diastole. Diseases such as hemochromatosis or amyloidosis can cause stiffening of the heart muscle and impair the ventricles' capacity to relax and fill; this is referred to as diastolic dysfunction. The most common cause of this is longstanding high blood pressure resulting in a thickened (hypertrophied) heart. Additionally, in some patients, although the pumping action and filling capacity of the heart may be normal, abnormally high oxygen demand by the body's tissues (for example, with hyperthyroidism) may make it difficult for the heart to supply an adequate blood flow (called high output heart failure). In some patients one or more of these factors can be present to cause congestive heart failure. Congestive heart failure can affect many organs of the body. For example, the weakened heart muscles may not be able to supply enough blood to the kidneys, which then begin to lose their normal ability to excrete salt (sodium) and water. This diminished kidney function can cause to body to retain more fluid. The lungs may become congested with fluid (pulmonary edema) and the person's ability to exercise is decreased. Fluid may likewise accumulate in the liver, thereby impairing its ability to rid the body of toxins and produce essential proteins. The intestines may become less efficient in absorbing nutrients and medicines. Over time, untreated, worsening congestive heart failure will affect virtually every organ in the body.
11. Agonism Action
Agonism action refers to the binding of a molecule to a receptor that leads to the activation of the receptor, thus triggering a cellular response similar to the cellular response for a known agonist for the receptor.
12. Antagonism Action
Antagonism action refers to the binding of a molecule to a receptor that leads to the inhibition of the receptor.
13. Modulate
To modulate, or forms thereof, means either increasing, decreasing, or maintaining a cellular activity mediated through a cellular target. It is understood that wherever one of these words is used it is also disclosed that it could be 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%, 500%, or 1000% increased from a control, or it could be 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, or 100% decreased from a control.

Throughout this application, various publications are referenced. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this pertains. The references disclosed are also individually and specifically incorporated by reference herein for the material contained in them that is discussed in the sentence in which the reference is relied upon.
17. Subject
As used throughout, by a ‚Äúsubject‚Äù is meant an individual. Thus, the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù can include, for example, domesticated animals, such as cats, dogs, etc., livestock (e.g., cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, etc.), laboratory animals (e.g., mouse, rabbit, rat, guinea pig, etc.) mammals, non-human mammals, primates, non-human primates, rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and any other animal. The subject can be a mammal such as a primate or a human. The subject can also be a non-human.
18. Treating
By ‚Äútreating‚Äù or ‚Äútreatment‚Äù is meant the medical management of a patient with the intent to cure, ameliorate, stabilize, or prevent a disease, pathological condition, or disorder. These terms include active treatment, that is, treatment directed specifically toward the improvement of a disease, pathological condition, or disorder, and also includes causal treatment, that is, treatment directed toward removal of the cause of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. These terms can mean that the symptoms of the underlying disease are reduced, and/or that one or more of the underlying cellular, physiological, or biochemical causes or mechanisms causing the symptoms are reduced. It is understood that reduced, as used in this context, means relative to the state of the disease, including the molecular state of the disease, not just the physiological state of the disease. In certain situations a treatment can inadvertently cause harm. In addition, these terms include palliative treatment, that is, treatment designed for the relief of symptoms rather than the curing of the disease, pathological condition, or disorder; preventative treatment, that is, treatment directed to minimizing or partially or completely inhibiting the development of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder; and supportive treatment, that is, treatment employed to supplement another specific therapy directed toward the improvement of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. These terms mean both treatment having a curing or alleviating purpose and treatment having a preventive purpose. The treatment can be made either acutely or chronically. It is understood that treatment can mean a reduction or one or more symptoms or characteristics by at least 5% 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 100%, relative to a control. In the context of these terms, preventing refers to the ability of a compound or composition (such as the disclosed compounds and compositions) to prevent a disease identified herein in patients diagnosed as having the disease or who are at risk of developing such disease. In this context, preventing includes the delaying the onset of the disease relative to a control. These terms do not require that the treatment in fact be effective to produce any of the intended results. It is enough that the results are intended.
19. Therapeutically Effective
The term ‚Äútherapeutically effective‚Äù means that the amount of the composition used is of sufficient quantity to treat a subject as defined herein.
20. Toxicity
Toxicity is the degree to which a substance, molecule, is able to damage something, such as a cell, a tissue, an organ, or a whole organism, that has been exposed to the substance or molecule. For example, the liver, or cells in the liver, hepatocytes, can be damaged by certain substances. The methods of the present invention are preferably non-toxic.
The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of noncritical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results.

Example A
Calcium FLIPR Assay
The intracellular calcium assay was carried out in a 384-well format FLIPR‚Ñ¢ (Molecular Device) HEK293/GHSR1a cell line. Cells were seeded 24 hr prior to the experiments at an optimal density per well. Preincubation with selected calcium dye lasted for 30-60 min at room temperature or 37¬∞ C. Test compounds, dissolved in DMSO, were added at the appropriate time and incubated for 15 min followed by the addition of ghrelin with FlexStation or FLIPR. Relative fluorescence was monitored by the FLIPR‚Ñ¢ Molecular Device. EC50 and IC50 values were estimated from dose-response data using GraphPad Prism software. To check for GHSR-1a agonism the compound was added at t=20 sec. and the calcium response was followed for 2 minutes. To check for GHSR-1a antagonism the compound and Ghrelin (10 nM) were added to the cells at t=20 sec. and the calcium response was measured for 2 minutes. The potency of the antagonist was calculated by its ability to reduce the ghrelin response. Dose-response curves were made for relevant antagonists.
Example B
Evaluation of GHSR1a Antagonists on Food Intake Test in Mouse
Male C57BL/6J mice, 18-22 g body weight, were fasted overnight (16 h before compound administration) and placed in a regular light dark cycle (6:00-18:00 light/18:00-6:00 dark). After 1 wk acclimation, animals were sorted into two groups (n=6 each, 2 per cage) based on body weight. Animals in group one were be treated with vehicle and animals in group 2 were treated with the test agent (n=6 for each group). The cumulative food intake was evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hrs after drug or vehicle treatment. Food intake was measured by subtracting uneaten food from the initial premeasured food.
The following table presents representative compounds of Formula I with biological data including the ghrelin antagonist/agonist activity in vitro (Example A) and mouse food intake results (Example B). The data clearly demonstrates that compounds of Formula I are ghrelin receptor modulators and are useful in preventing and/or treating diseases associated with ghrelin receptor, for example, obesity.

Example C
Effect of Ghrelin Antagonists of Formula I on Binge Eating in Non-Estrous Female Rats
In this Example, the therapeutic potential of compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit binge eating. The animal model used was developed to explore the combination of food restriction and stress. Results disclosed below show that female rats submitted to cycles of food restriction and exposure, the day of the test, to Highly Palatable Food (HPF) for 15 minutes without getting access to it, showed a pronounced and statistically significant increase in HPF intake. Considering the reliability and the robustness of this model, it was adopted to test the inventive compounds. Topiramate, used as reference compound, confirmed its inhibitory effect in this procedure. Moreover, results show that, after acute administration, H0900, H0816, and H0847, reduced binge eating episodes showed in R+S group. H0860, at the considered doses, did not significantly reduce HPF intake in animals exposed to the same procedure.
Animals and Housing:
A total of N=117, 52-day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (175-200 g) were used. Rats were acclimated in individual cages with metallic walls; the floor and the front wall made of metallic grid. The dimensions of the cage floor being 30 cm√ó30 cm; the cage is 30 cm high. A front door (30 cm√ó20 cm) made of metallic grid was positioned in the anterior wall of the cage to gain access to the inside of the cage; the remaining part of the front wall was equipped with a drinking burette.
Rats were kept in a room at constant temperature (20-22¬∞ C.) and humidity (45-55%) under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 08:00 am) with ad lib chow and water.
All procedures were conducted in adherence to the European Community Directive for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Diets:
Rats were offered food pellets, 4RF18, Mucedola, Settimo Milanese, Italy (2.6 kcal/g). The Highly Palatable Food (HPF) was prepared by mixing:
a) Nutella Ferrero chocolate cream (5.33 kcal/g; 56%, 31% and 7%, respectively, from carbohydrate, fat and protein): 52%
b) grounded food pellets 4RF18, Mucedola, Settimo Milanese, Italy: 33%
c) water: 15%
Experimental Design:
The rats were weight-matched into one of two groups so there was no significant difference in mean body weight between the groups:
Group 1: non-restricted and not exposed to stress (NR+NS): N=9
Group 2: restricted and exposed to stress (R+S): N=108
Once assigned to one of these groups, the rats remained in that group throughout the study. The rats exposed to stress were acclimated in different rooms than the group not exposed to stress.
Rats were exposed to 3 consecutive 8-day cycles followed by the final test on day 25:
a) the control group (NR+NS) had chow ad libitum for 4 days, on days 5-6 it received chow+HPF for 2 h; on days 7-8 it had chow ad libitum; on day 25 it was not exposed to stress;
b) the second group (R+S) had chow restricted to 66% of the normal intake for 4 days, was offered chow and HPF (2 h) on days 5-6 and only chow on days 7-8; on day 25 it was not exposed to stress.
The 8-day cycle was repeated three times, but in the third cycle the animals did not have access to
By the last day of re-feeding, the body weight and food intake of restricted rats were not statistically different from those of non-restricted rats, thus precluding the potentially confounding effect of hunger or energy deficit.
Body weights and food intake were recorded daily. Food intake is expressed as mean kilocalories per kilogram ingested ¬±SEM.
On the test day (day 25) the animals were divided in the following groups as shown in Table 2:  TABLE 2
No. of
Animals  Procedure  Treatment
8  NR NS  Vehicle
9  R S  Vehicle
9  R S  H0816 3 mg/kg
9  R S  H0816 30 mg/kg
9  R S  H0860 3 mg/kg
9  R S  H0860 30 mg/kg
9  R S  H0847 3 mg/kg
9  R S  H0847 30 mg/kg
9  R S  H0900 3 mg/kg
9  R S  H0900 30 mg/kg
9  R S  Topiramate 60 mg/kg
It has been reported by Applicants (Micioni Di B et al. 2010) that in the estrous phase of the ovarian cycle, female rats do not exhibit BE in the adopted model; while in all the other three phase of the ovarian cycle they exhibit BE without significant differences in intensity. Therefore, immediately after the test on day 25, vaginal smears were collected and analyzed under microscope to assess the ovarian phase, and data from rats in the estrous phase were not included in the statistical analysis. Vaginal smears were analyzed by an experienced experimenter blind to treatment conditions.
The Stress Procedure:
For 15 min, the container (China coffee cup) containing HPF is placed outside the cage; the container handle is hooked to the top wire wall of the cage in the hollow part where food pellets are usually offered. In these conditions, the animal is able to see the cup in which it received HPF on days 5, 6, 13, and 14 of the first two cycles, is able to see in part the HPF itself, and is able to smell its odour. In this 15-min period, the rat engages in repeated movements of the forepaws, head, and trunk aimed at obtaining the HPF, but it is not able to reach it. Rats undergo the stressful procedure between 10.00 and 12.00 am. After 15 min, the cup is placed inside the cage of the rats in the stress group (R+S), so that the HPF became accessible to the rat.
Compound Preparation:
100 mg of each compound (H0816, H0860, H0847 and H0900) was accurately weighed and suspended in 13.33 ml of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC, Sigma-Aldrich Cat. C4888, lot 120M0216V) solution. The lower dose solution was prepared by dilution of 30 mg/ml suspension with 0.5% CMC solution. Suspensions were prepared freshly on test day. Vehicle was composed by a solution of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt and was prepared by dissolving 1 g of CMC in 200 ml of distilled water. 180 mg of Topiramate was accurately weighed and suspended in 12 ml of 0.5% CMC solution. Compounds (vehicle and active principles) were administered by gavage in a volume of 4 ml/kg of body weight one hour before access to HPF.
Data Analysis:
All data are expressed as the mean¬±s.e.m. and each value reflects the mean number of animals per group as described in the legends. For data evaluation, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used followed by post-hoc (Bonferroni's) test when appropriate. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. The Software used for the Graphs was Origin 7.0. The software for the statistical analysis was SYSTAT 13.0
Binge Eating Model:
The ANOVA revealed a highly significant difference in 2-h HPF intake in the 2 groups of rats following vehicle administration [F(1,12)=18.9; P<0.01]. As shown in FIG. 1 , following vehicle administration HPF intake in the R+S group was markedly higher than that of the control (NR+NS) group. HPF intake of R+S rats was very pronounced in the first 15 min of access to HPF; these animals never engaged in competing behaviours, but continuously remained over the cup containing HPF and focused their attention on the intake. Cumulative HPF intake in the R+S group was significantly higher than in controls up to 120 min after access to HPF.
Effect of Topiramate on Binge Eating:
The ANOVA revealed a significant difference in 2-h HPF intake in the R+S rats treated with Topiramate at the dose of 60 mg/kg [F(1,11)=16.2; P<0.01]. As shown in FIG. 2 , post-hoc comparisons revealed that the effect of Topiramate was statistically significant at all time points for the whole period in which BE was exhibited.
Effect of H0816 on Binge Eating:
The ANOVA revealed a significant difference in 2-h HPF intake in the R+S rats treated with H0816 at the doses of 3 and 30 mg/kg [F(2,19)=3.9; P<0.05]. As shown in FIG. 3 , post-hoc comparisons revealed that the effect of H0816 (30 mg/kg) was statistically significant (P<0.05) at 15 min time point. H0816 treatment (both doses) did not affect animals' gross behaviour during the 2-h test.
Effect of H0860 on Binge Eating:
As shown in FIG. 4 , H0860 at the doses of 3 and 30 mg/kg did not affect HPF intake in the R+S group [F(2,19)=0.6; P>0.05].
Effect of H0847 on Binge Eating:
The ANOVA revealed a significant difference in 2-h HPF intake in the R+S rats treated with H0847 at the doses of 3 and 30 mg/kg [F(2,19)=8.7; P<0.01]. As shown in FIG. 5 , post-hoc comparisons revealed that the effect of H0847 (3 mg/kg) was statistically significant at 15, 30 and 60 min after HPF access. At the dose of 30 mg/kg, H0847 significantly (P<0.01) reduced HPF intake at all time points for the whole period in which BE was exhibited. Two animals treated with H0847 (3 mg/kg) and one animal treated with the dose of 30 mg/kg showed a mild sedation during the 2-h test.
Effect of H0900 on Binge Eating:
The ANOVA revealed a significant difference in 2-h HPF intake in the R+S rats treated with H0900 at the doses of 3 and 30 mg/kg [F(2,18)=12.2; P<0.01]. As shown in FIG. 6 , post-hoc comparisons revealed that the effect of H0900 (30 mg/kg) was statistically significant (P<0.01) at all time points for the whole period in which BE was exhibited. H0900 treatment (both doses) did not affect animals' gross behaviour during the 2-h test.
Effect of Topiramate, H0816, H0860, H0847H0900 and Vehicle on 2-h Chow Food Intake During Binge Eating Test:
Statistical analysis indicated that acute administration of Topiramate [F(1,11)=0.9; P>0.05] or H0816 [F(2,19)=0.3; P>0.05] or H0900 [F(2,18)=2.2; P>0.05] did not modify 2-h chow intake. As shown in FIG. 7 A, the acute administration of H0860 [F(2,19)=22.9; P<0.01] and H0847 [F(2,19)=3.9; P<0.05] significantly increased 2-h chow food intake.
Statistical analysis indicated that acute administration of Topiramate [F(1,11)=0.00; P>0.05] or H0816 [F(2,19)=1.2; P>0.05] or H0900 [F(2,18)=2.7; P>0.05] did not modify 24-h chow intake.
As shown in FIG. 7 , the acute administration of H0860 [F(2,19)=14.2; P<0.01] and H0847 [F(2,19)=24.3; P<0.01] significantly increased 24-h chow food intake.
Effect of H0816 on Binge Eating (Second Test):
To confirm the effect of H0816 on BE, a second test was performed after ten days. Of 117 animals used in this study, 53 (the same 8 rats NR+NS and 45 rats R+S) were used for the second test. After one day off at the end of the first test, these groups of rats received an additional 8-day cycle: NR+NS group had 8 days of chow ad libitum, whereas R+S group had 4 days chow restricted to 66% of the normal intake followed by 4 days of chow ad libitum. In this additional cycle, all groups did not have access to HPF. The following day, R+S group was exposed to stress, while NR+NS group was not. On this day, H0816 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg) and topiramate (60 mg/kg) or vehicle were administered by gavage 1-h before access to HPF.
The ANOVA revealed a highly significant difference in 2-h HPF intake in the 2 groups of rats following vehicle administration [F(1,12)=28.1; P<0.01]. Cumulative HPF intake in the R+S group was significantly higher than in controls up to 120 min after access to it (data not shown). Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in 2-h HPF intake in the R+S rats treated with Topiramate at the dose of 60 mg/kg [F(1,12)=47.1; P<0.01]. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that the effect of Topiramate was statistically significant at all time points, that is for the whole period in which BE was exhibited (data not shown).
The ANOVA revealed a significant difference in 2-h HPF intake in the R+S rats treated with H0816 at the doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg [F(3,25)=3.3; P<0.05]. As shown in FIG. 8 , post-hoc comparisons revealed that the effect of H0816 (10 mg/kg) was statistically significant (P<0.05) at 15 min time point and the dose of 30 mg/kg completely blocked (P<0.01) the BE episode at 15 min. H0816 treatment (both doses) did not affect animals' gross behaviour during the 2-h test. Statistical analysis indicated that acute administration of Topiramate [F(1,12)=2.3; P>0.05] or H0816 [F(3,25)=0.2; P>0.05] did not modify 2-h and 24-h ([F(1,12)=0.03; P>0.05]; [F(3,25)=0.5; P>0.05]) chow intake (data not shown).
Topiramate, included in the experimental design as positive control, completely abolished BE episode at the dose of 60 mg/kg. In the same experiment, H0900, H0816, and H0847 significantly reduced BE behaviour in the R+S group, after acute administration, confirming the therapeutic potential of selective GHS-R1a antagonism in binge eaters.
In a second experiment, H0816 confirmed, dose dependently, its selective inhibitory effect on BE, with no effect on physiological feeding. Surprisingly, H0847 and H0860 significantly increased 2-h and 24-h chow food intake in the same animals, suggesting a not clean profile as GHS-R1a antagonist.
Example D
Characterizing the Effect of Compounds of Formula (I) on Operant Ethanol Self-Administration in Marchigian Sardinian Alcohol-Preferring (msP) Rats
In this experiment, msP-rats (N=24) were trained to self-administer 10% (v/v) ethanol solution in 30-min daily sessions under a fixed-ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement in which each response resulted in delivery of 0.1 mL of fluids. Training continued until stable baseline of alcohol responding was achieved. At this point, before initiation of treatments, rats were trained to gavage administration procedures for three consecutive days (pre-treatment phase) during which they received drug vehicle. At this point animals were tested for the effect of ghrelin antagonists on 10% (v/v) ethanol self-administration. Using a within-subject Latin square design, the first group of msP rats (N=12) was tested for the effect of H0847 (0.0, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg), while the second (N=12) was treated with H0816 (0.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg).
Once the experiment was finished, animals were left in their home cages for several days, in order to wash out the drugs. Then, the same rats were employed to test the remaining ghrelin antagonists compounds H0900 (0.0, 3.0 and 30.0 mg/kg) and H0860 (0.0, 3.0 and 30.0 mg/kg). Once a stable self-administration baseline was reached, treatments begun according to the same experimental procedures described for the previous drugs tested.
All the drugs (or vehicles) were administered orally 1 hour before the beginning of the operant session. Responses at the lever activated the delivery mechanism but did not result in the delivery of alcohol.
Animals and Housing:
Male genetically selected alcohol-preferring Marchigian Sardinian (msP) rats were used (N=24). At the time of the experiments their body weight ranged between 350 and 400 g. They were housed 4 per cages in a room with a reverse 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights off at 9:30 a.m.), temperature of 20-22¬∞ C. and humidity of 45-55%. Rats were offered free access to tap water and food pellets (4RF18, Mucedola, Settimo Milanese, Italy). All the procedures were conducted in adherence with the European Community Council Directive for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Compound Preparation:
75 mg of each H0900 and H0860 were accurately weighed and suspended in 10 ml of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt solution (CMC, Sigma-Aldrich Cat. C4888, lot 120M0216V). The lower dose solution was prepared by dilution of 30 mg/ml suspension with 0.5% CMC solution.
37.5 mg of H0816 were accurately weighed and suspended in 15 ml of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt solution (CMC, Sigma-Aldrich Cat. C4888, lot 120M0216V). The lower dose solution was prepared by dilution of mg/ml suspension with 0.5% CMC solution.
11.25 mg of H0847 were accurately weighed and suspended in 15 ml of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt solution (CMC, Sigma-Aldrich Cat. C4888, lot 120M0216V). The lower dose solution was prepared by dilution of mg/ml suspension with 0.5% CMC solution.
Suspensions were prepared freshly on test day. Vehicle was composed of a solution of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt and was prepared by dissolving 1 g of CMC in 200 ml of distilled water. Vehicle and drugs were administered by gavage in a volume of 4 ml/kg of body weight 1 hour before the access to 10% alcohol solution. 10% (v/v) ethanol solution was prepared every two days by diluting 95% (v/v) ethanol solution (F.L. CARSETTI s.n.c-CAMERINO) in drinkable water.
Equipment:
The self-administration stations consisted of operant conditioning chambers (Med Associate, Inc) enclosed in sound-attenuating, ventilated environmental cubicles. Each chamber was equipped with a drinking reservoir (volume capacity: 0.2) positioned 4 cm above the grid floor in the centre of the front panel of the chamber, two retractable levers located 3 cm (one to the right and the other to the left) of the drinking receptacle and a white cue light located 6 cm above the lever. An infusion pump was activated by responses on the right, or active lever, while responses on the left or inactive lever were recorded but did not result in activation of the pump. Activation of the pump resulted in a delivery of 0.1 ml of fluid. If a time out was programmed, lever presses during this period were counted but did not lead to further infusions. An IBM-compatible computer controlled the delivery of fluids (activation of syringe pump), presentation of visual stimuli and recording of the behavioral data.
Experimental Procedures:
Using operant self-administration chambers (Med Associates), msP rats were trained to lever press for 10% alcohol (v/v) until stable baseline of responding were achieved. 16 self-administration training sessions were carried out to train the animals. Operant sessions lasted 30 minutes and were conducted once a day during the dark phase of the light dark cycle. Active and inactive (control) lever responding were monitored.
After stable baseline of alcohol self-administration was established, msP rats were administered with vehicle or the inventive compounds at 2 different doses using a within subject design. Active and inactive lever responding was monitored: drugs were injected prior to the beginning of the self-administration session, according to indication.
The reinforcement program was FR1-LITO (Fixed Ratio‚Äî1 Light Time Out). During the 5 seconds time out (following the reinforced RR) a house light was switched on. The tests were conducted according to a within subject design where drug treatment (doses) was treated as repeated factors. Total number of active and inactive lever responding were subjected to statistical evaluation. Drug testing was carried out every four days. For 2 days before each drug test rats were not subjected to alcohol self-administration sessions.
Statistical Analysis:
Data were analyzed by means of a one-factor (treatment) ANOVA for repeated measures. Analysis of variance was followed by the Newman-Keuls test when appropriate. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.
As shown in FIG. 9 , H0847 had no effect on operant responding for alcohol [F(2,11)=0.53; p>0.05]. Responses at the inactive control lever were not modified [F(2,11)=0.53; p>0.05].
As shown in FIG. 10 , H0860 significantly reduced operant responding for alcohol [F(2,11)=4.19; p<0.05]. Post hoc analysis revealed a significant reduction of alcohol self-administration following treatment with the higher dose (30 mg/kg) (*p<0.05). Responses at the inactive control lever were not modified [F(2,11)=0.15; p>0.05].
As shown in FIG. 11 , H0816 had no effect on operant responding for alcohol [F(2,11)=0.75; p>0.05]. Responses at the inactive control lever were not modified [F(2,11)=0.30; p>0.05].
As shown in FIG. 12 , H0900 significantly reduced operant responding for alcohol [F(2,11)=8.62; p<0.01]. Post hoc analysis revealed a significant reduction of alcohol self-administration following treatment with both 3 mg/kg (*p<0.05) and 30 mg/kg (**p<0.01). Responses at the inactive control lever were not modified [F(2,11)=1.03; p>0.05].
In summary, the data shows that, in msP rats, acute oral administration of both H0900 and H0860 induced a statistically significant decrease in ethanol self-administration. For H0900, the effect was seen for both the doses tested (3 and 30 mg/kg). For H0860, only the higher dose (30 mg/kg) reduced ethanol self-administration. On the contrary, in the same experimental conditions, H0847 (1 or 3 mg/kg) and H0816 (3 or 10 mg/kg) had no effect on ethanol responses.
