TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention provides bipyrazole derivatives, as well as their compositions and methods of use, that modulate the activity of Janus kinase (JAK) and are useful in the treatment of diseases related to the activity of JAK including, for example, inflammatory disorders, autoimmune disorders, cancer, and other diseases.
BACKGROUND
Protein kinases (PKs) regulate diverse biological processes including cell growth, survival, differentiation, organ formation, morphogenesis, neovascularization, tissue repair, and regeneration, among others. Protein kinases also play specialized roles in a host of human diseases including cancer. Cytokines, low-molecular weight polypeptides or glycoproteins, regulate many pathways involved in the host inflammatory response to sepsis. Cytokines influence cell differentiation, proliferation and activation, and can modulate both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses to allow the host to react appropriately to pathogens. Signaling of a wide range of cytokines involves the Janus kinase family (JAKs) of protein tyrosine kinases and Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). There are four known mammalian JAKs: JAK1 (Janus kinase-1), JAK2, JAK3 (also known as Janus kinase, leukocyte; JAKL; and L-JAK), and TYK2 (protein-tyrosine kinase 2).
Cytokine-stimulated immune and inflammatory responses contribute to pathogenesis of diseases: pathologies such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) arise from suppression of the immune system, while a hyperactive or inappropriate immune/inflammatory response contributes to the pathology of autoimmune diseases (e.g., asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroiditis, myocarditis), and illnesses such as scleroderma and osteoarthritis (Ortmann, R. A., T. Cheng, et al. (2000) Arthritis Res 2(1): 16-32).
Deficiencies in expression of JAKs are associated with many disease states. For example, Jak1−/− mice are runted at birth, fail to nurse, and die perinatally (Rodig, S. J., M. A. Meraz, et al. (1998) Cell 93(3): 373-83). Jak2−/− mouse embryos are anemic and die around day 12.5 postcoitum due to the absence of definitive erythropoiesis.
The JAK/STAT pathway, and in particular all four JAKs, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of asthmatic response, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, and other related inflammatory diseases of the lower respiratory tract. Multiple cytokines that signal through JAKs have been linked to inflammatory diseases/conditions of the upper respiratory tract, such as those affecting the nose and sinuses (e.g., rhinitis and sinusitis) whether classically allergic reactions or not. The JAK/STAT pathway has also been implicated in inflammatory diseases/conditions of the eye and chronic allergic responses.
Activation of JAK/STAT in cancers may occur by cytokine stimulation (e.g. IL-6 or GM-CSF) or by a reduction in the endogenous suppressors of JAK signaling such as SOCS (suppressor or cytokine signaling) or PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) (Boudny, V., and Kovarik, J., Neoplasm. 49:349-355, 2002). Activation of STAT signaling, as well as other pathways downstream of JAKs (e.g., Akt), has been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types (Bowman, T., et al. Oncogene 19:2474-2488, 2000). Elevated levels of circulating cytokines that signal through JAK/STAT play a causal role in cachexia and/or chronic fatigue. As such, JAK inhibition may be beneficial to cancer patients for reasons that extend beyond potential anti-tumor activity.
JAK2 tyrosine kinase can be beneficial for patients with myeloproliferative disorders, e.g., polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis (MMM) (Levin, et al., Cancer Cell, vol. 7, 2005: 387-397). Inhibition of the JAK2V617F kinase decreases proliferation of hematopoietic cells, suggesting JAK2 as a potential target for pharmacologic inhibition in patients with PV, ET, and MMM.
Inhibition of the JAKs may benefit patients suffering from skin immune disorders such as psoriasis, and skin sensitization. The maintenance of psoriasis is believed to depend on a number of inflammatory cytokines in addition to various chemokines and growth factors (JCI, 113:1664-1675), many of which signal through JAKs (Adv Pharmacol. 2000; 47:113-74).
Thus, new or improved agents which inhibit kinases such as JAKs are continually needed for developing new and more effective pharmaceuticals that are aimed at augmentation or suppression of the immune and inflammatory pathways (such as immunosuppressive agents for organ transplants), as well as agents for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases, diseases involving a hyperactive inflammatory response (e.g., eczema), allergies, cancer (e.g., prostate, leukemia, multiple myeloma), and some immune reactions (e.g., skin rash or contact dermatitis or diarrhea) caused by other therapeutics. The compounds of the invention, as well as its compositions and methods described herein are directed toward these needs and other ends.

Different crystalline forms may have different crystalline lattices (e.g., unit cells) and, usually as a result, have different physical properties. The different salt forms can be identified by solid state characterization methods such as by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). Other characterization methods such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic vapor sorption (DVS), and the like further help identify the form as well as help determine stability and solvent/water content.
An XRPD pattern of reflections (peaks) is typically considered a fingerprint of a particular crystalline form. It is well known that the relative intensities of the XRPD peaks can widely vary depending on, inter alia, the sample preparation technique, crystal size distribution, various filters used, the sample mounting procedure, and the particular instrument employed. In some instances, new peaks may be observed or existing peaks may disappear, depending on the type of the instrument or the settings. As used herein, the term “peak” refers to a reflection having a relative height/intensity of at least about 4% of the maximum peak height/intensity. Moreover, instrument variation and other factors can affect the 2-theta values. Thus, peak assignments, such as those reported herein, can vary by plus or minus about 0.2° (2-theta), and the term “substantially” and “about” as used in the context of XRPD herein is meant to encompass the above-mentioned variations.
In the same way, temperature readings in connection with DSC, TGA, or other thermal experiments can vary about ±3° C. depending on the instrument, particular settings, sample preparation, etc. Accordingly, a crystalline form reported herein having a DSC thermogram “substantially” as shown in any of the Figures or the term “about” is understood to accommodate such variation.
In some embodiments, the salts described herein are substantially isolated. By “substantially isolated” is meant that the compound is at least partially or substantially separated from the environment in which it was formed or detected. Partial separation can include, for example, a composition enriched in the salts described herein. Substantial separation can include compositions containing at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 97%, or at least about 99% by weight of the salts described herein, or salt thereof. Methods for isolating compounds and their salts are routine in the art.
It is appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, can also be provided in combination in a single embodiment (while the embodiments are intended to be combined as if written in multiply dependent form). Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, can also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination.
At various places in the present specification, substituents of compounds of the invention are disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the invention include each and every individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges. For example, the term “C1-6 alkyl” is specifically intended to individually disclose methyl, ethyl, C3 alkyl, C4 alkyl, C5 alkyl, and C6 alkyl.
At various places in the present specification, linking substituents are described. Where the structure clearly requires a linking group, the Markush variables listed for that group are understood to be linking groups. For example, if the structure requires a linking group and the Markush group definition for that variable lists “alkyl” or “aryl” then it is to be understood that the “alkyl” or “aryl” represents a linking alkylene group or arylene group, respectively.
At various places in the present specification, rings are described (e.g., “a piperidine ring”). Unless otherwise specified, these rings can be attached to the rest of the molecule at any ring member as permitted by valency. For example, the term “a 2H-tetrahydropyran ring” may refer to a 2H-tetrahydropyran-2-yl, 2H-tetrahydropyran-3-yl, 2H-tetrahydropyran-4-yl ring, etc.
The term “n-membered” where n is an integer typically describes the number of ring-forming atoms in a moiety where the number of ring-forming atoms is n. For example, 2H-tetrahydropyran is an example of a 6-membered heterocycloalkyl ring, 1H-1,2,4-triazole is an example of a 5-membered heteroaryl ring, pyridine is an example of a 6-membered heteroaryl ring, and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalene is an example of a 10-membered cycloalkyl group.
For compounds of the invention in which a variable appears more than once, each variable can be a different moiety independently selected from the group defining the variable. For example, where a structure is described having two R groups that are simultaneously present on the same compound, the two R groups can represent different moieties independently selected from the group defined for R. In another example, when an optionally multiple substituent is designated in the form: then it is to be understood that substituent R can occur p number of times on the ring, and R can be a different moiety at each occurrence. It is to be understood that each R group may replace any hydrogen atom attached to a ring atom, including one or both of the (CH2)n hydrogen atoms. Further, in the above example, should the variable Q be defined to include hydrogens, such as when Q is said to be CH2, NH, etc., any floating substituent such as R in the above example, can replace a hydrogen of the Q variable as well as a hydrogen in any other non-variable component of the ring.
As used herein, the phrase “optionally substituted” means unsubstituted or substituted. As used herein, the term “substituted” means that a hydrogen atom is removed and replaced by a substituent. It is to be understood that substitution at a given atom is limited by valency.
As used herein, the term “Cn-m alkyl”, employed alone or in combination with other terms, refers to a saturated hydrocarbon group that may be straight-chain or branched, having n to m carbon atoms.

In some embodiments, heterocycloalkyl is 4-7 membered heterocycloalkyl, which is monocyclic, comprising 2-6 carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3, or 4 heteroatom ring members independently selected from nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. Examples of heterocycloalkyl groups include azetidine, azepane, pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine, morpholine, thiomorpholine, pyran, and a 2-oxo-1,3-oxazolidine ring.
As used herein, the term “heterocycloalkylalkyl” refers to a group of formula-alkylene-heterocycloalkyl. In some embodiments, heterocycloalkylalkyl is 4-7 membered heterocycloalkyl-C1-3 alkyl, wherein the heterocycloalkyl portion is monocyclic, comprising 2-6 carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3, or 4 heteroatom ring members independently selected from nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen.
The compounds described herein can be asymmetric (e.g., having one or more stereocenters). All stereoisomers, such as enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended unless otherwise indicated. Compounds of the present invention that contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Methods on how to prepare optically active forms from optically inactive starting materials are known in the art, such as by resolution of racemic mixtures or by stereoselective synthesis. Many geometric isomers of olefins, C═N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms.
Resolution of racemic mixtures of compounds can be carried out by any of numerous methods known in the art. An example method includes fractional recrystallization using a chiral resolving acid which is an optically active, salt-forming organic acid. Suitable resolving agents for fractional recrystallization methods are, for example, optically active acids, such as the D and L forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids such as β-camphorsulfonic acid. Other resolving agents suitable for fractional crystallization methods include stereoisomerically pure forms of α-methylbenzylamine (e.g., S and R forms, or diastereomerically pure forms), 2-phenylglycinol, norephedrine, ephedrine, N-methylephedrine, cyclohexylethylamine, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, and the like.
Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed with an optically active resolving agent (e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine). Suitable elution solvent composition can be determined by one skilled in the art.
Compounds of the invention also include tautomeric forms. Tautomeric forms result from the swapping of a single bond with an adjacent double bond together with the concomitant migration of a proton. Tautomeric forms include prototropic tautomers which are isomeric protonation states having the same empirical formula and total charge. Example prototropic tautomers include ketone-enol pairs, amide-imidic acid pairs, lactam-lactim pairs, enamine-imine pairs, and annular forms where a proton can occupy two or more positions of a heterocyclic system, for example, 1H- and 3H-imidazole, 1H-, 2H- and 4H-1,2,4-triazole, 1H- and 2H-isoindole, and 1H- and 2H-pyrazole. Tautomeric forms can be in equilibrium or sterically locked into one form by appropriate substitution. For example, it will be recognized that the following pyrazole ring may form two tautomers: It is intended that the claims cover both tautomers.
Compounds of the invention can also include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. In some embodiments, 1, 2, or 3 CH2 groups in the azetidine ring of Formula I are replaced by a CHD or CD2 group. In some embodiments, 1, 2, or 3 CH2 or CH groups in the piperidine ring of Formula I are replaced by a CHD, CD2 or CD group, respectively. In some embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 CH2 or CH groups in the piperidine ring of Formula I are replaced by a CHD, CD2 or CD group, respectively.
The term, “compound,” as used herein is meant to include all stereoisomers, geometric iosomers, tautomers, and isotopes of the structures depicted. Further, compounds herein identified by name or structure as one particular tautomeric form are intended to include other tautomeric forms unless otherwise specified.

In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention, or salts thereof, are substantially isolated. By “substantially isolated” is meant that the compound is at least partially or substantially separated from the environment in which it was formed or detected. Partial separation can include, for example, a composition enriched in the compounds of the invention. Substantial separation can include compositions containing at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 97%, or at least about 99% by weight of the compounds of the invention, or salt thereof. Methods for isolating compounds and their salts are routine in the art.
The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.

The present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by converting an existing acid or base moiety to its salt form. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention include the non-toxic salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, or butanol) or acetonitrile (ACN) are preferred.

An aromatic acid 1 can be conveniently converted to the corresponding amide 2 by using the amide coupling reagent such as BOP, PyOP, HATU, HBTU, EDC, or CDI. Replacement of the leaving group Hal (Hal can be halogen, OTs or OTf) in 2 by 3-hydroxyazetidine to produce compound 3 can be achieved under thermal conditions in a suitable solvent such as, but not limited to, DMSO, dioxane, DMF, or NMP in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, or sodium carbonate; or under copper-catalyzed Ullmann type N-arylation reaction conditions by using copper(I) iodide and potassium carbonate; or under palladium-catalyzed C—N bond forming reaction conditions using xanthpos, BINAP, or P(o-Tol)3 as the ligand and potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate as the base. α,β-Unsaturated nitrile 5 can be obtained by Wittigs reaction of diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate with the ketone 4 which can be prepared by Swern oxidation of 3. Michael addition of 6 with α,β-unsaturated nitrile 5 can afford the boronic ester 7. Suzuki coupling of the boronic ester 7 with a suitable pyrazole halide 8 can afford the corresponding bi-pyrazole derivative 9.
A series of boronic ester derivatives 7 can be prepared according to the procedures outlined in Scheme 2. Michael addition of 6 with α,β-unsaturated nitrile 10 can afford the boronic ester 11. Removal of the Boc-group can be achieved under acid conditions to afford the corresponding amine 12. Replacement of the leaving group Hal in 2 by 12 can produce the boronic ester 7 under thermal conditions in a suitable solvent such as, but not limited to, acetonitrile, DMSO, dioxane, DMF, or NMP in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium carbonate, hunig′s base or DBU.
A series of bi-pyrazole derivatives 21 can be prepared according to the methods outlined in Scheme 3. Halo-aromatic esters 13 can be converted to the corresponding alkenes 14 by Suzuki coupling of the halo-aromatic esters 13 with vinyl boronic esters. Alkenes 14 can be reacted with appropriately substituted ketenes (such as dichcloroketene) under 2+2 cycloadditions to give the dichlorocyclobutanones 15. Under reducing conditions (such as zinc in acetic acid under thermal conditions) the dichlorocyclobutanones 15 can be converted to cyclobutanones 16. α,β-Unsaturated nitriles 17 can be formed by reaction of the cyclobutanones 16 with Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reagent. Boronic esters 6 can be reacted with α,β-unsaturated nitriles 17 in Michael addition conditions in the presence of coupling agents to give the compounds 18. Suzuki coupling of the boronic esters 18 with suitable pyrazole halides 8 can afford the corresponding bi-pyrazoles 19. Hydrolysis of esters 19 under basic conditions can give the acids 20. The amides 21 can be synthesized by coupling of acids 20 with appropriately substituted amines using amide coupling reagents such as BOP, PyBop, HATU, HBTU, EDC, or CDI. Processes

Methods
Compounds of the invention are JAK inhibitors, and the majority of the compounds of the invention, are JAK1 selective inhibitors. A JAK1 selective inhibitor is a compound that inhibits JAK1 activity preferentially over other Janus kinases. For example, the compounds of the invention preferentially inhibit JAK1 over one or more of JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. In some embodiments, the compounds inhibit JAK1 preferentially over JAK2 (e.g., have a JAK1/JAK2 IC50 ratio >1). In some embodiments, the compounds are about 10-fold more selective for JAK1 over JAK2. In some embodiments, the compounds are about 3-fold, about 5-fold, about 10-fold, about 15-fold, or about 20-fold more selective for JAK1 over JAK2 as calculated by measuring IC50 at 1 mM ATP (e.g., see Example A).
JAK1 plays a central role in a number of cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways that, when dysregulated, can result in or contribute to disease states. For example, IL-6 levels are elevated in rheumatoid arthritis, a disease in which it has been suggested to have detrimental effects (Fonesca, J. E. et al., Autoimmunity Reviews, 8:538-42, 2009). Because IL-6 signals, at least in part, through JAK1, antagonizing IL-6 directly or indirectly through JAK1 inhibition is expected to provide clinical benefit (Guschin, D., N., et al Embo J 14:1421, 1995; Smolen, J. S., et al. Lancet 371:987, 2008). Moreover, in some cancers JAK1 is mutated resulting in constitutive undesirable tumor cell growth and survival (Mullighan C G, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.106:9414-8, 2009; Flex E., et al. J Exp Med. 205:751-8, 2008). In other autoimmune diseases and cancers elevated systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines that activate JAK1 may also contribute to the disease and/or associated symptoms. Therefore, patients with such diseases may benefit from JAK1 inhibition. Selective inhibitors of JAK1 may be efficacious while avoiding unnecessary and potentially undesirable effects of inhibiting other JAK kinases.
Selective inhibitors of JAK1, relative to other JAK kinases, may have multiple therapeutic advantages over less selective inhibitors. With respect to selectivity against JAK2, a number of important cytokines and growth factors signal through JAK2 including, for example, erythropoietin (Epo) and thrombopoietin (Tpo) (Parganas E, et al. Cell. 93:385-95, 1998). Epo is a key growth factor for red blood cells production; hence a paucity of Epo-dependent signaling can result in reduced numbers of red blood cells and anemia (Kaushansky K, NEJM 354:2034-45, 2006). Tpo, another example of a JAK2-dependent growth factor, plays a central role in controlling the proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes—the cells from which platelets are produced (Kaushansky K, NEJM 354:2034-45, 2006). As such, reduced Tpo signaling would decrease megakaryocyte numbers (megakaryocytopenia) and lower circulating platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). This can result in undesirable and/or uncontrollable bleeding. Reduced inhibition of other JAKs, such as JAK3 and Tyk2, may also be desirable as humans lacking functional version of these kinases have been shown to suffer from numerous maladies such as severe-combined immunodeficiency or hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Minegishi, Y, et al. Immunity 25:745-55, 2006; Macchi P, et al. Nature. 377:65-8, 1995). Therefore a JAK1 inhibitor with reduced affinity for other JAKs would have significant advantages over a less-selective inhibitor with respect to reduced side effects involving immune suppression, anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of treating a JAK-associated disease or disorder in an individual (e.g., patient) by administering to the individual in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount or dose of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. A JAK-associated disease can include any disease, disorder or condition that is directly or indirectly linked to expression or activity of the JAK, including overexpression and/or abnormal activity levels. A JAK-associated disease can also include any disease, disorder or condition that can be prevented, ameliorated, or cured by modulating JAK activity.
Examples of JAK-associated diseases include diseases involving the immune system including, for example, organ transplant rejection (e.g., allograft rejection and graft versus host disease).
Further examples of JAK-associated diseases include autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, type I diabetes, lupus, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease, myasthenia gravis, immunoglobulin nephropathies, myocarditis, autoimmune thyroid disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the like. In some embodiments, the autoimmune disease is an autoimmune bullous skin disorder such as pemphigus vulgaris (PV) or bullous pemphigoid (BP).
Further examples of JAK-associated diseases include allergic conditions such as asthma, food allergies, eszematous dermatitis, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis (atropic eczema), and rhinitis. Further examples of JAK-associated diseases include viral diseases such as Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, HTLV 1, Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).
Further examples of JAK-associated disease include diseases associated with cartilage turnover, for example, gouty arthritis, septic or infectious arthritis, reactive arthritis, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, algodystrophy, Tietze syndrome, costal athropathy, osteoarthritis deformans endemica, Mseleni disease, Handigodu disease, degeneration resulting from fibromyalgia, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, or ankylosing spondylitis.
Further examples of JAK-associated disease include congenital cartilage malformations, including hereditary chrondrolysis, chrondrodysplasias, and pseudochrondrodysplasias (e.g., microtia, enotia, and metaphyseal chrondrodysplasia).
Further examples of JAK-associated diseases or conditions include skin disorders such as psoriasis (for example, psoriasis vulgaris), atopic dermatitis, skin rash, skin irritation, skin sensitization (e.g., contact dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis). For example, certain substances including some pharmaceuticals when topically applied can cause skin sensitization. In some embodiments, co-administration or sequential administration of at least one JAK inhibitor of the invention together with the agent causing unwanted sensitization can be helpful in treating such unwanted sensitization or dermatitis. In some embodiments, the skin disorder is treated by topical administration of at least one JAK inhibitor of the invention.
In further embodiments, the JAK-associated disease is cancer including those characterized by solid tumors (e.g., prostate cancer, renal cancer, hepatic cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, cancers of the head and neck, thyroid cancer, glioblastoma, Kaposis sarcoma, Castlemans disease, uterine leiomyosarcoma, melanoma etc.), hematological cancers (e.g., lymphoma, leukemia such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or multiple myeloma), and skin cancer such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. Example CTCLs include Sezary syndrome and mycosis fungoides.
In some embodiments, the JAK inhibitors described herein, or in combination with other JAK inhibitors, such as those reported in U.S. Ser. No. 11/637,545, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, can be used to treat inflammation-associated cancers. In some embodiments, the cancer is associated with inflammatory bowel disease. In some embodiments, the inflammatory bowel disease is ulcerative colitis. In some embodiments, the inflammatory bowel disease is Crohns disease. In some embodiments, the inflammation-associated cancer is colitis-associated cancer. In some embodiments, the inflammation-associated cancer is colon cancer or colorectal cancer. In some embodiments, the cancer is gastric cancer, gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), adenocarcinoma, small intestine cancer, or rectal cancer.
JAK-associated diseases can further include those characterized by expression of: JAK2 mutants such as those having at least one mutation in the pseudo-kinase domain (e.g., JAK2V617F); JAK2 mutants having at least one mutation outside of the pseudo-kinase domain; JAK1 mutants; JAK3 mutants; erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) mutants; or deregulated expression of CRLF2.
JAK-associated diseases can further include myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), systemic mast cell disease (SMCD), and the like. In some embodiments, the myeloproliferative disorder is myelofibrosis (e.g., primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or post polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (Post-PV/ET MF)). In some embodiments, the myeloproliferative disorder is post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (Post-ET MF). In some embodiments, the myeloproliferative disorder is post polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (Post-PV MF).
In some embodiments, JAK inhibitors described herein can be further used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a patient in need thereof. In some embodiments, said patient is red blood cell transfusion dependent.
As used herein, myelodysplastic syndromes are intended to encompass heterogeneous and clonal hematopoietic disorders that are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis on one or more of the major myeloid cell lineages. Myelodysplastic syndromes are associated with bone marrow failure, peripheral blood cytopenias, and a propensity to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Moreover, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities can be detected in about 50% of cases with MDS. In 1997, The World Health Organization (WHO) in conjunction with the Society for Hematopathology (SH) and the European Association of Hematopathology (EAHP) proposed new classifications for hematopoietic neoplasms (Harris, et al., J Clin Oncol 1999; 17:3835-3849; Vardiman, et al., Blood 2002; 100:2292-2302). For MDS, the WHO utilized not only the morphologic criteria from the French-American-British (FAB) classification but also incorporated available genetic, biologic, and clinical characteristics to define subsets of MDS (Bennett, et al., Br J Haematol 1982; 51:189-199). In 2008, the WHO classification of MDS (Table 1) was further refined to allow precise and prognostically relevant subclassification of unilineage dysplasia by incorporating new clinical and scientific information (Vardiman, et al., Blood 2009; 114:937-951; Swerdlow, et al., WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. 4th Edition.

The active compound may be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patients symptoms, and the like.
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.
The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.
The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present invention can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.

Gels can be formulated using isopropyl alcohol and water, suitably in combination with other components such as, for example, glycerol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like. In some embodiments, topical formulations contain at least about 0.1, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.5, at least about 1, at least about 2, or at least about 5 wt % of the compound of the invention. The topical formulations can be suitably packaged in tubes of, for example, 100 g which are optionally associated with instructions for the treatment of the select indication, e.g., psoriasis or other skin condition.
The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.
The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.
The therapeutic dosage of a compound of the present invention can vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 μs/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
The compositions of the invention can further include one or more additional pharmaceutical agents such as a chemotherapeutic, steroid, anti-inflammatory compound, or immunosuppressant, examples of which are listed hereinabove.
In some embodiments, the compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is administered as an ophthalmic composition. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the methods comprise administration of the compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and an ophthalmically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a liquid composition, semi-solid composition, insert, film, microparticles or nanoparticles.
In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a liquid composition. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a semi-solid composition. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a topical composition. The topical compositions include, but are not limited to liquid and semi-solid compositions. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a topical composition. In some embodiments, the topical composition comprises aqueous solution, an aqueous suspension, an ointment or a gel. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is topically applied to the front of the eye, under the upper eyelid, on the lower eyelid and in the cul-de-sac. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is sterilized. The sterilization can be accomplished by known techniques like sterilizing filtration of the solution or by heating of the solution in the ampoule ready for use. The ophthalmic compositions of the invention can further contain pharmaceutical excipients suitable for the preparation of ophthalmic formulations. Examples of such excipients are preserving agents, buffering agents, chelating agents, antioxidant agents and salts for regulating the osmotic pressure.
As used herein, the term “ophthalmically acceptable carrier” refers to any material that can contain and release the compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and that is compatible with the eye. In some embodiments, the ophthalmically acceptable carrier is water or an aqueous solution or suspension, but also includes oils such as those used to make ointments and polymer matrices such as used in ocular inserts. In some embodiments, the composition may be an aqueous suspension comprising the compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Liquid ophthalmic compositions, including both ointments and suspensions, may have a viscosity that is suited for the selected route of administration. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition has a viscosity in the range of from about 1,000 to about 30,000 centipoise.
In some embodiments, the ophthalmic compositions may further comprise one or more of surfactants, adjuvants, buffers, antioxidants, tonicity adjusters, preservatives (e.g., EDTA, BAK (benzalkonium chloride), sodium chlorite, sodium perborate, polyquaterium-1), thickeners or viscosity modifiers (e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, glycol 400, propylene glycol hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxpropyl-guar, hyaluronic acid, and hydroxypropyl cellulose) and the like. Additives in the formulation may include, but are not limited to, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sorbic acid, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, chlorhexidine, castor oil, and sodium perborate.
Aqueous ophthalmic compositions (solutions or suspensions) generally do not contain physiologically or ophthalmically harmful constituents. In some embodiments, purified or deionized water is used in the composition. The pH may be adjusted by adding any physiologically and ophthalmically acceptable pH adjusting acids, bases or buffers to within the range of about 5.0 to 8.5. Ophthalmically acceptable examples of acids include acetic, boric, citric, lactic, phosphoric, hydrochloric, and the like, and examples of bases include sodium hydroxide, sodium phosphate, sodium borate, sodium citrate, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, tromethamine, trishydroxymethylamino-methane, and the like. Salts and buffers include citrate/dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, ammonium chloride and mixtures of the aforementioned acids and bases.
In some embodiments, the methods involve forming or supplying a depot of the therapeutic agent in contact with the external surface of the eye. A depot refers to a source of therapeutic agent that is not rapidly removed by tears or other eye clearance mechanisms. This allows for continued, sustained high concentrations of therapeutic agent to be present in the fluid on the external surface of the eye by a single application. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that absorption and penetration may be dependent on both the dissolved drug concentration and the contact duration of the external tissue with the drug containing fluid. As the drug is removed by clearance of the ocular fluid and/or absorption into the eye tissue, more drug is provided, e.g. dissolved, into the replenished ocular fluid from the depot. Accordingly, the use of a depot may more easily facilitate loading of the ocular tissue for more insoluble therapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the depot can remain for up to eight hours or more. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic depot forms includes, but is not limited to, aqueous polymeric suspensions, ointments, and solid inserts.
In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is an ointment or gel. In some embodiment, the ophthalmic composition is an oil-based delivery vehicle. In some embodiments, the composition comprises a petroleum or lanolin base to which is added the active ingredient, usually as 0.1 to 2%, and excipients. Common bases may include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, petrolatum and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the ointment is applied as a ribbon onto the lower eyelid.
In some embodiment, the ophthalmic composition is an ophthalmic insert. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic insert is biologically inert, soft, bio-erodible, viscoelastic, stable to sterilization after exposure to therapeutic agents, resistant to infections from air borne bacteria, bio-erodible, biocompatible, and/or viscoelastic. In some embodiments, the insert comprises an ophthalmically acceptable matrix, e.g., a polymer matrix. The matrix is typically a polymer and the therapeutic agent is generally dispersed therein or bonded to the polymer matrix. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent may be slowly released from the matrix through dissolution or hydrolysis of the covalent bond. In some embodiments, the polymer is bioerodible (soluble) and the dissolution rate thereof can control the release rate of the therapeutic agent dispersed therein. In another form, the polymer matrix is a biodegradable polymer that breaks down such as by hydrolysis to thereby release the therapeutic agent bonded thereto or dispersed therein. In further embodiments, the matrix and therapeutic agent can be surrounded with an additional polymeric coating to further control release. In some embodiments, the insert comprises a biodegradable polymer such as polycaprolactone (PCL), an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), polyalkyl cyanoacrylate, polyurethane, a nylon, or poly (dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), or a copolymer of any of these. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is dispersed into the matrix material or dispersed amongst the monomer composition used to make the matrix material prior to polymerization. In some embodiments, the amount of therapeutic agent is from about 0.1 to about 50%, or from about 2 to about 20%. In further embodiments, the biodegradable or bioerodible polymer matrix is used so that the spent insert does not have to be removed. As the biodegradable or bioerodible polymer is degraded or dissolved, the therapeutic agent is released.
In further embodiments, the ophthalmic insert comprises a polymer, including, but are not limited to, those described in Wagh, et al., “Polymers used in ocular dosage form and drug delivery systems”, Asian J. Pharm., pages 12-17 (January 2008), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the insert comprises a polymer selected from polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), an acrylate or methacrylate polymer or copolymer (e.g., Eudragit® family of polymers from Rohm or Degussa), hydroxymethyl cellulose, polyacrylic acid, poly(amidoamine) dendrimers, poly(dimethyl siloxane), polyethylene oxide, poly(lactide-co-glycolide), poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate), poly(vinyl alcohol), or poly(propylene fumarate). In some embodiments, the insert comprises Gelfoam® R. In some embodiments, the insert is a polyacrylic acid of 450 kDa-cysteine conjugate.
In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a ophthalmic film.
Polymers suitable for such films include, but are not limited to, those described in Wagh, et al. (ibid), In some embodiments, the film is a soft-contact lens, such as ones made from copolymers of N,N-diethylacrylamide and methacrylic acid crosslinked with ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate.
In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition comprises microspheres or nanoparticles. In some embodiment, the microspheres comprise gelatin. In some embodiments, the microspheres are injected to the posterior segment of the eye, in the chroroidal space, in the sclera, intravitreally or sub-retinally. In some embodiments, the microspheres or nanoparticles comprises a polymer including, but not limited to, those described in Wagh, et al. (ibid), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the polymer is chitosan, a polycarboxylic acid such as polyacrylic acid, albumin particles, hyaluronic acid esters, polyitaconic acid, poly(butyl)cyanoacrylate, polycaprolactone, poly(isobutyl)caprolactone, poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid), or poly(lactic acid).

In some embodiments, the ion-exchange resin is a partially neutralized polyacrylic acid.
In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is an aqueous polymeric suspension. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent or a polymeric suspending agent is suspended in an aqueous medium. In some embodiments, the aqueous polymeric suspensions may be formulated so that they retain the same or substantially the same viscosity in the eye that they had prior to administration to the eye. In some embodiments, they may be formulated so that there is increased gelation upon contact with tear fluid.
Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods
Another aspect of the present invention relates to labeled compounds of the invention (radio-labeled, fluorescent-labeled, etc.) that would be useful not only in imaging techniques but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating JAK in tissue samples, including human, and for identifying JAK ligands by inhibition binding of a labeled compound. Accordingly, the present invention includes JAK assays that contain such labeled compounds.
The present invention further includes isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention. An “isotopically” or “radio-labeled” compound is a compound of the invention where one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to 3H (also written as T for tritium), 11C, 13C, 14 C, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 18F, 35S, 36CL, 82Br, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br, 123I, 124I, 125I and 131I. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro JAK labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate 3H, 14C, 82Br, 125I, 131I, 35S or will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications 11C, 18F, 125I, 123I, 124I, 131I, 75Br, 76Br or 77Br will generally be most useful.
It is to be understood that a “radio-labeled” or “labeled compound” is a compound that has incorporated at least one radionuclide. In some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of 3H, 14C, 125I, 35S and 82Br. In some embodiments, the compound incorporates 1, 2, or 3 deuterium atoms.
The present invention can further include synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into compounds of the invention. Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are well known in the art, and an ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize the methods applicable for the compounds of invention.
A labeled compound of the invention can be used in a screening assay to identify/evaluate compounds. For example, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) which is labeled can be evaluated for its ability to bind a JAK by monitoring its concentration variation when contacting with the JAK, through tracking of the labeling. For example, a test compound (labeled) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of another compound which is known to bind to a JAK (i.e., standard compound). Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the standard compound for binding to the JAK directly correlates to its binding affinity. Conversely, in some other screening assays, the standard compound is labeled and test compounds are unlabeled. Accordingly, the concentration of the labeled standard compound is monitored in order to evaluate the competition between the standard compound and the test compound, and the relative binding affinity of the test compound is thus ascertained.
Kits
The present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in the treatment or prevention of JAK-associated diseases or disorders, such as cancer, which include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Such kits can further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, for example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, can also be included in the kit.
The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non-critical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. The compounds of the Examples have been found to be JAK inhibitors according to at least one assay described herein.

Step 1. 4-[3-(Cyanomethyl)-3-(3′,5′-dimethyl-1H,1′H-4,4′-bipyrazol-1-yl)azetidin-1-yl]-2,5-difluoro-N-[(1S)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-methylethyl]benzamide phosphoric acid salt (crude)
To a clear solution of 4-[3-(cyanomethyl)-3-(3′,5′-dimethyl-1H,1′H-4,4′-bipyrazol-1-yl)azetidin-1-yl]-2,5-difluoro-N-[(1S)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-methylethyl]benzamide (405.0 g, 798.1 mmol) in methanol (520.0 mL) and isopropanol (2550.0 mL) at 50° C. was added an aqueous solution of 85% phosphoric acid (119.65 g, 1037.8 mmol) in isopropanol (120.0 mL) over 18 minutes to form a slurry. The resulting slurry was stirred at 50° C. for 1 h. n-Heptane (4050.0 mL) was then added to the slurry over 40 min, while maintaining the internal temperature of the slurry between 46 to 53° C. After the addition of n-heptane, the slurry was gradually cooled to room temperature and stirred at room temperature for 19 h. The solids were then collected by filtration, washed with a mixture of isopropanol and n-heptane (3:10 by volume, 2×700 mL) followed by n-heptane (3×550 mL), and dried under vacuum at room temperature to afford crude 4-[3-(cyanomethyl)-3-(3′,5′-dimethyl-1H,1′H-4,4′-bipyrazol-1-yl)azetidin-1-yl]-2,5-difluoro-N-[(1S)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-methylethyl]benzamide phosphoric acid salt (434.6 g, 89.9% yield).
Step 2. 4-[3-(Cyanomethyl)-3-(3′,5′-dimethyl-1H,1′H-4,4′-bipyrazol-1-yl)azetidin-1-yl]-2,5-difluoro-N-[(1S)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-methylethyl]benzamide phosphoric acid salt (purified)
Into a 22 L round bottom flask equipped with an overhead stirring mechanism and a Teflon-coated thermocouple was added 4-[3-(cyanomethyl)-3-(3′,5′-dimethyl-1H,1′H-4,4′-bipyrazol-1-yl)azetidin-1-yl]-2,5-difluoro-N-[(1S)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-methylethyl]benzamide phosphoric acid salt of Step 1 (958.3 g, 1583 mmol) and methanol (MeOH, 9583.0 mL) at room temperature. The resulting slurry was heated to 50° C. to give a clear, light-orange colored solution. The solution was polish filtered, transferred back to the 22 L flask and heated to reflux to distill methanol (4793 g, 6090 mL) over 70 min. Isopropanol (7700 mL) was then added to the flask over 30 min while maintaining the solution temperature between 50 to 65° C. After complete addition of isopropanol, n-heptane (14400 mL) was added portion-wise while maintaining a gentle distillation of the solvent mixture (MeOH, IPA and n-heptane) over 2.5 h. A total of 10818 g (15000 mL) of the solvent mixture was distilled. The resulting slurry was gradually cooled to room temperature, and stirred at room temperature for 17 h. The solids were collected by filtration, washed with a mixture of isopropanol and n-heptane (1:5 by volume, 3000 mL) followed by n-heptane (3×4000 mL), and dried under vacuum at room temperature to afford the title compound as off-white crystalline powder (925.7 g, 96.6% yield).

Example A
In Vitro JAK Kinase Assay
Compounds herein were tested for inhibitory activity of JAK targets according to the following in vitro assay described in Park et al., Analytical Biochemistry 1999, 269, 94-104. The catalytic domains of human JAK1 (a.a. 837-1142), JAK2 (a.a. 828-1132) and JAK3 (a.a. 781-1124) with an N-terminal His tag were expressed using baculovirus in insect cells and purified. The catalytic activity of JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3 was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of a biotinylated peptide. The phosphorylated peptide was detected by homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF). IC50s of compounds were measured for each kinase in the 40 microL reactions that contain the enzyme, ATP and 500 nM peptide in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.8) buffer with 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mg/mL (0.01%) BSA. For the 1 mM 1050 measurements, ATP concentration in the reactions was 1 mM. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 1 hour and then stopped with 20 μL 45 mM EDTA, 300 nM SA-APC, 6 nM Eu-Py20 in assay buffer (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.). Binding to the Europium labeled antibody took place for 40 minutes and HTRF signal was measured on a Fusion plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.). See Table 11 for data related to compounds of the examples.  TABLE 11

Cellular Assays
Cancer cell lines dependent on cytokines and hence JAK/STAT signal transduction, for growth, can be plated at 6000 cells per well (96 well plate format) in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, and 1 nG/mL of appropriate cytokine. Compounds can be added to the cells in DMSO/media (final concentration 0.2% DMSO) and incubated for 72 hours at 37° C., 5% CO2. The effect of compound on cell viability is assessed using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) followed by TopCount (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.) quantitation. Potential off-target effects of compounds are measured in parallel using a non-JAK driven cell line with the same assay readout. All experiments are typically performed in duplicate.
The above cell lines can also be used to examine the effects of compounds on phosphorylation of JAK kinases or potential downstream substrates such as STAT proteins, Akt, Shp2, or Erk. These experiments can be performed following an overnight cytokine starvation, followed by a brief preincubation with compound (2 hours or less) and cytokine stimulation of approximately 1 hour or less. Proteins are then extracted from cells and analyzed by techniques familiar to those schooled in the art including Western blotting or ELISAs using antibodies that can differentiate between phosphorylated and total protein. These experiments can utilize normal or cancer cells to investigate the activity of compounds on tumor cell survival biology or on mediators of inflammatory disease. For example, with regards to the latter, cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, or IFN can be used to stimulate JAK activation resulting in phosphorylation of STAT protein(s) and potentially in transcriptional profiles (assessed by array or qPCR technology) or production and/or secretion of proteins, such as IL-17. The ability of compounds to inhibit these cytokine mediated effects can be measured using techniques common to those schooled in the art.
Compounds herein can also be tested in cellular models designed to evaluate their potency and activity against mutant JAKs, for example, the JAK2V617F mutation found in myeloid proliferative disorders. These experiments often utilize cytokine dependent cells of hematological lineage (e.g. BaF/3) into which the wild-type or mutant JAK kinases are ectopically expressed (James, C., et al. Nature 434:1144-1148; Staerk, J., et al. JBC 280:41893-41899). Endpoints include the effects of compounds on cell survival, proliferation, and phosphorylated JAK, STAT, Akt, or Erk proteins.
Certain compounds herein can be evaluated for their activity inhibiting T-cell proliferation. Such as assay can be considered a second cytokine (i.e. JAK) driven proliferation assay and also a simplistic assay of immune suppression or inhibition of immune activation. The following is a brief outline of how such experiments can be performed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are prepared from human whole blood samples using Ficoll Hypaque separation method and T-cells (fraction 2000) can be obtained from PBMCs by elutriation. Freshly isolated human T-cells can be maintained in culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at a density of 2×106 cells/ml at 37° C. for up to 2 days. For IL-2 stimulated cell proliferation analysis, T-cells are first treated with Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL for 72 hours. After washing once with PBS, 6000 cells/well are plated in 96-well plates and treated with compounds at different concentrations in the culture medium in the presence of 100 U/mL human IL-2 (ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene; Rehovot, Israel). The plates are incubated at 37° C. for 72 h and the proliferation index is assessed using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent reagents following the manufactory suggested protocol (Promega; Madison, Wis.).
Example C
In Vivo Anti-Tumor Efficacy
Compounds herein can be evaluated in human tumor xenograft models in immune compromised mice. For example, a tumorigenic variant of the INA-6 plasmacytoma cell line can be used to inoculate SCID mice subcutaneously (Burger, R., et al. Hematol J. 2:42-53, 2001). Tumor bearing animals can then be randomized into drug or vehicle treatment groups and different doses of compounds can be administered by any number of the usual routes including oral, i.p., or continuous infusion using implantable pumps. Tumor growth is followed over time using calipers. Further, tumor samples can be harvested at any time after the initiation of treatment for analysis as described above (Example B) to evaluate compound effects on JAK activity and downstream signaling pathways. In addition, selectivity of the compound(s) can be assessed using xenograft tumor models that are driven by other know kinases (e.g. Bcr-Abl) such as the K562 tumor model.
Example D
Murine Skin Contact Delayed Hypersensitivity Response Test
Compounds herein can also be tested for their efficacies (of inhibiting JAK targets) in the T-cell driven murine delayed hypersensitivity test model. The murine skin contact delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response is considered to be a valid model of clinical contact dermatitis, and other T-lymphocyte mediated immune disorders of the skin, such as psoriasis (Immunol Today. 1998 January; 19(1):37-44). Murine DTH shares multiple characteristics with psoriasis, including the immune infiltrate, the accompanying increase in inflammatory cytokines, and keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Furthermore, many classes of agents that are efficacious in treating psoriasis in the clinic are also effective inhibitors of the DTH response in mice (Agents Actions. 1993 January; 38(1-2):116-21).
On Day 0 and 1, Balb/c mice are sensitized with a topical application, to their shaved abdomen with the antigen 2,4,dinitro-fluorobenzene (DNFB). On day 5, ears are measured for thickness using an engineers micrometer. This measurement is recorded and used as a baseline. Both of the animals' ears are then challenged by a topical application of DNFB in a total of 20 μL (10 μL on the internal pinna and 10 μL on the external pinna) at a concentration of 0.2%. Twenty-four to seventy-two hours after the challenge, ears are measured again. Treatment with the test compounds is given throughout the sensitization and challenge phases (day −1 to day 7) or prior to and throughout the challenge phase (usually afternoon of day 4 to day 7). Treatment of the test compounds (in different concentration) is administered either systemically or topically (topical application of the treatment to the ears). Efficacies of the test compounds are indicated by a reduction in ear swelling comparing to the situation without the treatment. Compounds causing a reduction of 20% or more were considered efficacious. In some experiments, the mice are challenged but not sensitized (negative control).
The inhibitive effect (inhibiting activation of the JAK-STAT pathways) of the test compounds can be confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Activation of the JAK-STAT pathway(s) results in the formation and translocation of functional transcription factors. Further, the influx of immune cells and the increased proliferation of keratinocytes should also provide unique expression profile changes in the ear that can be investigated and quantified. Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded ear sections (harvested after the challenge phase in the DTH model) are subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody that specifically interacts with phosphorylated STAT3 (clone 58E12, Cell Signaling Technologies). The mouse ears are treated with test compounds, vehicle, or dexamethasone (a clinically efficacious treatment for psoriasis), or without any treatment, in the DTH model for comparisons. Test compounds and the dexamethasone can produce similar transcriptional changes both qualitatively and quantitatively, and both the test compounds and dexamethasone can reduce the number of infiltrating cells. Both systemically and topical administration of the test compounds can produce inhibitive effects, i.e., reduction in the number of infiltrating cells and inhibition of the transcriptional changes.
Example E
In Vivo Anti-Inflammatory Activity
Compounds herein can be evaluated in rodent or non-rodent models designed to replicate a single or complex inflammation response. For instance, rodent models of arthritis can be used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of compounds dosed preventatively or therapeutically. These models include but are not limited to mouse or rat collagen-induced arthritis, rat adjuvant-induced arthritis, and collagen antibody-induced arthritis. Autoimmune diseases including, but not limited to, multiple sclerosis, type I-diabetes mellitus, uveoretinitis, thyroditis, myasthenia gravis, immunoglobulin nephropathies, myocarditis, airway sensitization (asthma), lupus, or colitis may also be used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of compounds herein. These models are well established in the research community and are familiar to those schooled in the art (Current Protocols in Immunology, Vol 3., Coligan, J. E. et al, Wiley Press; Methods in Molecular Biology: Vol. 225, Inflammation Protocols., Winyard, P. G. and Willoughby, D. A., Humana Press, 2003.).
Example F
Animal Models for the Treatment of Dry Eye, Uveitis, and Conjunctivitis
Agents may be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of dry eye known to those schooled in the art including, but not limited to, the rabbit concanavalin A (ConA) lacrimal gland model, the scopolamine mouse model (subcutaneous or transdermal), the Botulinumn mouse lacrimal gland model, or any of a number of spontaneous rodent autoimmune models that result in ocular gland dysfunction (e.g. NOD-SCID, MRL/lpr, or NZB/NZW) (Barabino et al., Experimental Eye Research 2004, 79, 613-621 and Schrader et al., Developmental Opthalmology, Karger 2008, 41, 298-312, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Endpoints in these models may include histopathology of the ocular glands and eye (cornea, etc.) and possibly the classic Schirmer test or modified versions thereof (Barabino et al.) which measure tear production. Activity may be assessed by dosing via multiple routes of administration (e.g. systemic or topical) which may begin prior to or after measurable disease exists.
Agents may be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of uveitis known to those schooled in the art. These include, but are not limited to, models of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) and endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU). EAU experiements may be performed in the rabbit, rat, or mouse and may involve passive or activate immunization. For instance, any of a number or retinal antigens may be used to sensitize animals to a relevant immunogen after which animals may be challenged ocuarly with the same antigen. The EIU model is more acute and involves local or systemic administration of lipopolysaccaride at sublethal doses. Endpoints for both the EIU and EAU models may include fundoscopic exam, histopathology amongst others. These models are reviewed by Smith et al. (Immunology and Cell Biology 1998, 76, 497-512, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Activity is assessed by dosing via multiple routes of administration (e.g. systemic or topical) which may begin prior to or after measurable disease exists. Some models listed above may also develop scleritis/episcleritis, chorioditis, cyclitis, or iritis and are therefore useful in investigating the potential activity of compounds for the therapeutic treatment of these diseases.
Agents may also be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of conjunctivitis known those schooled in the art. These include, but are not limited to, rodent models utilizing guinea-pig, rat, or mouse. The guinea-pig models include those utilizing active or passive immunization and/or immune challenge protocols with antigens such as ovalbumin or ragweed (reviewed in Groneberg, D. A., et al., Allergy 2003, 58, 1101-1113, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Rat and mouse models are similar in general design to those in the guinea-pig (also reviewed by Groneberg). Activity may be assessed by dosing via multiple routes of administration (e.g. systemic or topical) which may begin prior to or after measurable disease exists. Endpoints for such studies may include, for example, histological, immunological, biochemical, or molecular analysis of ocular tissues such as the conjunctiva.
Example G
In Vivo Protection of Bone
Compounds may be evaluated in various preclinical models of osteopenia, osteoporosis, or bone resorption known to those schooled in the art. For example, ovariectomized rodents may be used to evaluate the ability of compounds to affect signs and markers of bone remodeling and/or density (W. S. S. Jee and W. Yao, J Musculoskel. Nueron. Interact., 2001, 1(3), 193-207, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Alternatively, bone density and architecture may be evaluated in control or compound treated rodents in models of therapy (e.g. glucocorticoid) induced osteopenia (Yao, et al. Arthritis and Rheumatism, 2008, 58(6), 3485-3497; and id. 58(11), 1674-1686, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In addition, the effects of compounds on bone resorption and density may be evaluable in the rodent models of arthritis discussed above (Example E). Endpoints for all these models may vary but often include histological and radiological assessments as well as immunohisotology and appropriate biochemical markers of bone remodeling.
Example H
S100A9 Transgenic Mouse Model
It was previously shown that S100A9 transgenic mice display bone marrow accumulation of MDSC accompanied by development of progressive multilineage cytopenias and cytological dysplasia similar to MDS. Further, early forced maturation of MDSC by either all-trans-retinoic acid treatment or active immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-bearing (ITAM-bearing) adapter protein (DAP12) interruption of CD33 signaling rescued the hematologic phenotype and mitigated the disease. This system can be useful to test the effects on JAK1 inhibition on MDS-like disease in a preclinical model. J. Clin. Invest., 123(11):4595-4611 (2013), Accordingly, a JAK1 selective inhibitor is dosed by oral gavage. The compounds ability to reduce the cytopenias and cytological dysplasia observed in the S100A9 transgenic mice is monitored.
