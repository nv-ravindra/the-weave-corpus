FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to certain pyrazoles, their N-oxides, salts and compositions, and methods of their use as fungicides.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The control of plant diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens is extremely important in achieving high crop efficiency. Plant disease damage to ornamental, vegetable, field, cereal, and fruit crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new compounds which are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different sites of action.

DETAILS OF THE INVENTION
As used herein, the terms “comprises”, “comprising”, “includes”, “including”, “has”, “having”, “contains”, “containing”, “characterized by” or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion, subject to any limitation explicitly indicated. For example, a composition, mixture, process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such composition, mixture, process, method, article, or apparatus.
The transitional phrase “consisting of” excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified. If in the claim, such would close the claim to the inclusion of materials other than those recited except for impurities ordinarily associated therewith. When the phrase “consisting of” appears in a clause of the body of a claim, rather than immediately following the preamble, it limits only the element set forth in that clause; other elements are not excluded from the claim as a whole.
The transitional phrase “consisting essentially of” is used to define a composition, method or apparatus that includes materials, steps, features, components, or elements, in addition to those literally disclosed, provided that these additional materials, steps, features, components, or elements do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention. The term “consisting essentially of” occupies a middle ground between “comprising” and “consisting of”.
Where applicants have defined an invention or a portion thereof with an open-ended term such as “comprising,” it should be readily understood that (unless otherwise stated) the description should be interpreted to also describe such an invention using the terms “consisting essentially of” or “consisting of.”
Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, “or” refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).
Also, the indefinite articles “a” and “an” preceding an element or component of the invention are intended to be nonrestrictive regarding the number of instances (i.e. occurrences) of the element or component. Therefore “a” or “an” should be read to include one or at least one, and the singular word form of the element or component also includes the plural unless the number is obviously meant to be singular.
As referred to in the present disclosure and claims, “plant” includes members of Kingdom Plantae, particularly seed plants (Spermatopsida), at all life stages, including young plants (e.g., germinating seeds developing into seedlings) and mature, reproductive stages (e.g., plants producing flowers and seeds). Portions of plants include geotropic members typically growing beneath the surface of the growing medium (e.g., soil), such as roots, tubers, bulbs and corms, and also members growing above the growing medium, such as foliage (including stems and leaves), flowers, fruits and seeds.
As referred to herein, the term “seedling”, used either alone or in a combination of words means a young plant developing from the embryo of a seed.
As referred to herein, the term “broadleaf” used either alone or in words such as “broadleaf crop” means dicot or dicotyledon, a term used to describe a group of angiosperms characterized by embryos having two cotyledons.
As used herein, the term “alkylating agent” refers to a chemical compound in which a carbon-containing radical is bound through a carbon atom to a leaving group such as halide or sulfonate, which is displaceable by bonding of a nucleophile to said carbon atom. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “alkylating agent” or “alkylating reagent” does not limit the carbon-containing radical to alkyl; the carbon-containing radicals in alkylating agents include the variety of carbon-bound substituent radicals specified, for example, for R1 and R2.
Generally when a molecular fragment (i.e. radical) is denoted by a series of atom symbols (e.g., C, H, N, O and S) the implicit point or points of attachment will be easily recognized by those skilled in the art. In some instances herein, particularly when alternative points of attachment are possible, the point or points of attachment may be explicitly indicated by a hyphen (“-”). For example, “—SCN” indicates that the point of attachment is the sulfur atom (i.e. thiocyanato, not isothiocyanato).

The term “unsubstituted” in connection with a group such as a ring means the group does not have any substituents other than its one or more attachments to the remainder of Formula 1. The term “optionally substituted” means that the number of substituents can be zero. Unless otherwise indicated, optionally substituted groups may be substituted with as many optional substituents as can be accommodated by replacing a hydrogen atom with a non-hydrogen substituent on any available carbon or nitrogen atom. Commonly, the number of optional substituents (when present) range from 1 to 3. As used herein, the term “optionally substituted” is used interchangeably with the phrase “substituted or unsubstituted” or with the term “(un)substituted.”
The number of optional substituents may be restricted by an expressed limitation. For example, the phrase “optionally substituted with up to 3 substituents independently selected from R3a on carbon atom ring members” means that 0, 1, 2 or 3 substituents can be present (if the number of potential connection points allows). Similarly, the phrase “optionally substituted with up to 5 substituents independently selected from R3a” means that 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 substituents can be present if the number of available connection points allows.
When a compound is substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript that indicates the number of said substituents can vary (e.g., (R3a)p in Table 1 wherein p is 0 to 5), then said substituents are independently selected from the group of defined substituents, unless otherwise indicated. When a variable group is shown to be optionally attached to a position, for example (R3a)p in Table 1 wherein p may be 0, then hydrogen may be at the position even if not recited in the definition of the variable group.
Unless otherwise indicated, a “ring” or “ring system” as a component of Formula 1 (e.g., Q1 or Q2) is carbocyclic (e.g., phenyl or naphthalenyl) or heterocyclic (e.g., pyridinyl). The term “ring member” refers to an atom (e.g., C, O, N or S) forming the backbone of a ring. The term “ring system” denotes two or more fused rings (e.g., quinazolinyl).
The term “nonaromatic” includes rings that are fully saturated as well as partially or fully unsaturated, provided that none of the rings are aromatic. The term “aromatic” indicates that each of the ring atoms of a fully unsaturated ring are essentially in the same plane and have a p-orbital perpendicular to the ring plane, and that (4n+2) π electrons, where n is a positive integer, are associated with the ring to comply with Hickel's rule.
The terms “carbocyclic ring” or “carbocycle” denote a ring wherein the atoms forming the ring backbone are selected only from carbon. When a fully unsaturated carbocyclic ring satisfies Hickel's rule, then said ring is also called an “aromatic carbocyclic ring”. The term “saturated carbocyclic ring” refers to a ring having a backbone consisting of carbon atoms linked to one another by single bonds; unless otherwise specified, the remaining carbon valences are occupied by hydrogen atoms.
The terms “heterocyclic ring”, “heterocycle” or “heteroaromatic ring system” denote a ring or ring system in which at least one atom forming the ring backbone is not carbon (e.g., N, O or S). Typically a heterocyclic ring contains no more than 3 N atoms, no more than 2 O atoms and no more than 2 S atoms. Unless otherwise indicated, a heterocyclic ring can be a saturated, partially unsaturated or fully unsaturated ring. When a fully unsaturated heterocyclic ring satisfies Hickel's rule, then said ring is also called a “heteroaromatic ring” or “aromatic heterocyclic ring”. Unless otherwise indicated, heterocyclic rings can be attached through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen.
In the context of the present invention when an instance of Q1 and Q2 comprises a phenyl or 6-membered heterocyclic ring (e.g., pyridinyl), the ortho, meta and para positions of each ring are relative to the connection of the ring to the remainder of Formula 1.
Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. The compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers or as an optically active form.
One skilled in the art recognizes that some of the compounds disclosed herein can exist in equilibrium with one or more of their respective tautomeric counterparts. Unless otherwise indicated, reference to a compound by one tautomer description is to be considered to include all tautomers.
One skilled in the art recognizes that because in the environment and under physiological conditions salts of chemical compounds are in equilibrium with their corresponding nonsalt forms, salts share the biological utility of the nonsalt forms. Thus a wide variety of salts of the compounds of Formula 1 are useful for control of plant diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens (i.e. are agriculturally suitable). The salts of the compounds of Formula 1 include acid-addition salts with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric, fumaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-toluenesulfonic or valeric acids.
Compounds selected from Formula 1, stereoisomers, N-oxides, and salts thereof, typically exist in more than one form, therefore Formula 1 includes all crystalline and non-crystalline forms of the compounds that Formula 1 represents. Non-crystalline forms include embodiments which are solids such as waxes and gums as well as embodiments which are liquids such as solutions and melts. Crystalline forms include embodiments which represent essentially a single crystal type and embodiments which represent a mixture of polymorphs (i.e. different crystalline types). The term “polymorph” refers to a particular crystalline form of a chemical compound that can crystallize in different crystalline forms, these forms having different arrangements and/or conformations of the molecules in the crystal lattice. Although polymorphs can have the same chemical composition, they can also differ in composition due to the presence or absence of co-crystallized water or other molecules, which can be weakly or strongly bound in the lattice. Polymorphs can differ in such chemical, physical and biological properties as crystal shape, density, hardness, color, chemical stability, melting point, hygroscopicity, suspensibility, dissolution rate and biological availability. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a polymorph of a compound represented by Formula 1 can exhibit beneficial effects (e.g., suitability for preparation of useful formulations, improved biological performance) relative to another polymorph or a mixture of polymorphs of the same compound represented by Formula 1. Preparation and isolation of a particular polymorph of a compound represented by Formula 1 can be achieved by methods known to those skilled in the art including, for example, crystallization using selected solvents and temperatures.

One or more of the following methods and variations as described in Schemes 1-22 can be used to prepare the compounds of Formula 1. The definitions of Q1, Q2, X, R1, R1a, R2, R3a, R3b, R4 and R5a in the compounds of Formulae 1-35 below are as defined above in the Summary of the Invention unless otherwise noted. Formulae 1a-1k, 1m and 1n are various subsets of Formula 1. Substituents for each subset formula are as defined for its parent formula unless otherwise noted.
Compounds of Formula 1 can be prepared as shown in Scheme 1. In this method a compound of Formula 2 is first treated with an organometallic agent of Formula 3 such as an alkyl lithium base (e.g., n-butyllithium, s-butyllithium or lithium diisopropylamide) or a Grignard reagent in a solvent such as toluene, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dimethoxymethane at temperatures ranging from about −78° C. to ambient temperature. Anions of Formula 2a are then contacted with an electrophile of Formula 4, 5 or 6. The use and choice of an appropriate electrophile will depend on the desired compound of Formula 1 and will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis. For example, chlorosulfides of formula Q2SCl or disulfies formula of Q2S—S-Q2 (i.e. Formula 4) provide compounds of Formula 1a (i.e. Formula 1 wherein X is S), aldehydes of the formula Q2CHO (i.e. Formula 5) provide compounds of Formula 1b (i.e. Formula 1 wherein X is CH(OH)) and nitrosobenzenes of formula Q2-N═O (i.e. Formula 6) provide compounds of Formula 1c (i.e. Formula 1 wherein X is N(OH)). There are a wide-variety of general methods described in the synthetic literature for metalation/alkylation reactions which can be readily adapted to prepare compounds of the present invention; see, for example Inorganic Chemistry 2012, 51(17), 9385-9394 and PCT Publication WO 2010/030922 A1 (Example 4, Step D, Example 6 and Example 9, Step E).
Electrophiles of Formulae 4, 5 and 6 are commercially available and can be prepared by methods known in the art. Compounds of Formula 2 are known and can be prepared by the method disclosed in Scheme 6 below, and by a variety of methods disclosed in the chemical literature.
Alternatively, as shown in Scheme 2, compounds of Formula 1b (i.e. Formula 1 wherein X is C(OH)) can be prepared from the corresponding ketone compounds of Formula 7 using standard reduction techniques. Typical reaction conditions involve contacting a compound of Formula 7 with a boron-based reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol or tetrahydrofuran. Other techniques known to those skilled in the art may also be employed. For relevant references, see, for example, Journal of the American Chemical Society 2006, 128, 9998-9999 and PCT Publication WO 2010/030922 A1 (Examples 8 and 11).
As shown in Scheme 3, compounds of Formula 7 can also be treated with alkylmagnesium halides to provide compounds of Formula 1d (i.e. Formula 1 wherein X is C(OH)R5a and R5a is C1-C6 alkyl). Typically the reaction is run in presence of zinc chloride and in a solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran at temperatures from about 0-100° C. For reaction conditions; see, for example, Journal of the American Chemical Society 2006, 128, 9998-9999.
As shown in Scheme 4, intermediates of Formula 7 can be prepared using a method analogous to Scheme 1, wherein anions of Formula 2a are treated with benzoyl chlorides of formula Q1C(═O)Cl (i.e. Formula 8) or benzamides of formula Q1C(═O)N(Me)OMe (i.e. Formula 9) to provide compounds of Formula 7. In cases where the electrophile is Q1C(═O)Cl, the addition of a second organometallic reagent such as zinc chloride, zinc bromide or a monovalent copper salt such as copper(I) iodide or copper(I) cyanide before the addition of the electrophile promotes reactivity. For a related reference, see, for example, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1986, 29(9), 1628-11637.
In an alternate approach, intermediates of Formula 7 can also be prepared from compounds of Formula 10 using Friedel-Crafts acylation conditions as illustrated in Scheme 5. In this method, a compound of Formula 10 is contacted with an acid chloride of Formula 11 in the presence of a Lewis acid (e.g., aluminum chloride, boron trifluoride diethyl etherate or tin tetrachloride) in a solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrachloroethane or nitrobenzene, at temperatures ranging between about 0 to 200° C. In the present disclosure, Example 1, Step D illustrates the method of Scheme 5.
As shown in Scheme 6, intermediates of Formula 2 are readily prepared from compounds of Formula 10 by treatment with a halogenating agent. Suitable halogenating agents for this method include N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), N-iodosuccinimide (NIS), bromine, sodium bromite, thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, phenylphosphonic dichloride or phosgene. Particularly useful is N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and N-iodosuccinimide (NIS). Suitable solvents for this reaction include, for example, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobutane, benzene, xylenes, chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane, acetonitrile, and the like. Optionally, a base such as sodium carbonate, triethylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline, and the like can be added. Typical reaction temperatures range from about ambient temperature to 200° C. For representative procedures, see, for example, Czarnocki et al., Synthesis Communications 2007, 37(1), 137-147, and PCT Publication WO 2010/030922 A1 (Example 3, Step C, Example 4, Step C and Example 9, Step D).
As shown in Scheme 7, intermediates of Formula 10 can be prepared by reaction of a 5-bromo or 5-iodo pyrazole of Formula 12 under transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction conditions. In this method reaction of a pyrazole of Formula 12 is contacted with a compound of formula Q1-M2 (i.e. Formula 13) in the presence of a suitable palladium, copper or nickel catalyst, to provide a compound of Formula 10. Suitable compounds of formula Q1-M2 include organoboronic acids (e.g., M2 is B(OH)2), organoboronic esters (e.g., M2 is B(—OC(CH3)2C(CH3)2O—)), organotrifluoroborates (e.g., M2 is BF3K), organotin reagents (e.g., M2 is Sn(n-Bu)3, Sn(Me)3), Grignard reagents (e.g., M2 is MgBr or MgCl) or organozinc reagents (e.g., M2 is ZnBr or ZnCl). Suitable metal catalysts include, but are not limited to: palladium(II) acetate, palladium(II) chloride, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0), bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride, dichloro[1,1′-bis(diphenyl-phosphino)ferrocene]palladium(II), bis(triphenylphosphine)dichloronickel(II) and copper(I) salts (e.g., copper(I) iodide, copper(I) bromide, copper(I) chloride, copper(I) cyanide or copper(I) triflate). Optimal conditions for each reaction will depend on the catalyst used and the counterion attached to the coupling reagent (i.e. M2), as is understood by one skilled in the art. In some cases the addition of a ligand such as a substituted phosphine or a substituted bisphosphinoalkane promotes reactivity. Also, the presence of a base such as an alkali carbonate, tertiary amine or alkali fluoride may be necessary for some reactions involving organoboron reagents of the formula Q1-M2.

Alternatively, as shown in Scheme 8, intermediates of Formula 10 can be prepared by cyclization of enones of Formula 14 with an appropriately substituted hydrazine of formula NH2NH—CHR1R1a (i.e. Formula 15) and subsequent oxidation of pyrazolines of Formula 16. Useful oxidizing reagents include bromine (for conditions see, for example, Indian Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry, 2001, 11(1), 21-26), elemental sulfur, manganese dioxide, 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ), chloranil (for conditions see, for example, Russian Journal of Organic Chemistry 2006, 42(8), 1113-1119) and oxygen optionally in the presence of a metal catalyst such as cobalt acetate (for conditions see, for example, Tetrahedron 2006, 62(11), 2492-2496 and Chinese Chemical Letters 2008, 19(9), 1013-1016). Useful solvents for this reaction include N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, water, dichloromethane, tetrachloroethane, and mixtures of these or similar solvents, at temperatures from ambient to 200° C. The reaction of hydrazines with enones and the preparation of the enones is well-known in the art, see, for example, Synthesis 2012, 44, 2401-2407 and PCT Publication WO 2010/030922 A1 (Example 4, Step B). Also, in the present disclosure, Example 1, Step C illustrates the method of Scheme 8.
As shown in Scheme 9, compounds of Formula 12 can be prepared by alkylation of corresponding pyrazoles of Formula 17 with an alkylating agent of formula CHR1R1a-L2 (i.e. Formula 18) wherein L2 is a leaving group such as halogen or (halo)alkylsulfonate (e.g., Cl, Br, I, p-toluenesulfonate, methanesulfonate or trifluoromethanesulfonate). General procedures for alkylations of this type are well-known in the art and can be readily adapted to prepare compounds of the present invention. Particularly useful alkylating agents for preparing compounds of Formula 12 (wherein R1 and R1a) are H are diazomethane or iodomethane using general procedures known in the art, such as those described in Tetrahedron Letters 2009, 50(49), 6783-6786 and PCT Publication WO 2010/030922 A1 (Example 9, Step B).
Starting compounds of Formula 17 are known and can be prepared by a variety of methods disclosed in the chemical literature, see, for example, PCT Publication WO 2010/030922 A1 (Example 9, Step A).
As shown in Scheme 10, Compounds of Formula 1 wherein X is O, S or NR4 can be prepared by reacting compounds of Formula 19 (e.g., 4-hydroxypyrazoles for X being O, 4-mercaptopyrazoles for X being S and 4-aminopyrazoles for X being NR4) with compounds of Formula 20 where L2 is a leaving group such as halogen or (halo)alkylsulfonate (e.g., Cl, Br, I, p-toluenesulfonate, methanesulfonate or trifluoromethanesulfonate), optionally in the presence of a metal catalyst, and generally in the presence of a base and a polar aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide. Compounds of Formula 20 wherein Q2 is a phenyl ring substituted with electron-withdrawing substituents react with compounds of Formula 19 by direct displacement of the leaving group L2 to provide compounds of Formula 1. Typically for these types of reactions L2 is F or Cl. Compounds of Formula 20 wherein Q2 is a phenyl ring not substituted with an electron-withdrawing substituent, or in general, to improve reaction rate, yield or product purity, the use of a metal catalyst in amounts ranging from catalytic up to superstoichiometric can facilitate the desired reaction. Typically for these conditions, L2 is Br or I or a sulfonate such as —OS(O)2CF3 or —OS(O)2(CF2)3CF3. For example, the reaction can be run in the presence of a metal catalyst such as copper salt complexes (e.g., CuI with N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine, proline or bipyridyl), or palladium complexes (e.g., tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)) or palladium salts (e.g., palladium acetate) with ligands such as 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene, 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2′,4′,6′-triisopropylbiphenyl or 2,2′-bis-(diphenylphosphino)1,1′-binaphthalene, and with a base such as potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium phenoxide or sodium tert-butoxide, in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, dimethyl sulfoxide, 1,4-dioxane or toluene, optionally containing an alcohol such as ethanol. For representative procedures, see, for example, Archives of Pharmacal Research 2002, 25(6), 781-785 and PCT Publication WO 2010/030922 A1 (Example 1, Step C and Example 2, Step G).
Compounds of Formula 19 are commercially available and their preparation is known in the art, see, for example, Journal für Praktische Chemie (Leipzig) 1911, 83, 171-182, Journal of the American Chemical Society 1954, 76, 501-503 and PCT Publication WO 2010/030922 A1 (Example 1, Steps A through B).
As shown in Scheme 11, compounds of Formula 1 can also be prepared by reaction of a 5-bromo or 5-iodo pyrazole of Formula 21 with an organometallic compound of Formula 22 under transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction conditions analogous to those described for Scheme 7. Reaction of a pyrazole of Formula 21 with a boronic acid, trialkyltin or an organomagnesium reagent of Formula 22 in the presence of a palladium or nickel catalyst and optionally a ligand (e.g., triphenylphosphine, dibenzylideneacetone, dicyclohexyl(2′,6′-dimethoxy[1,1′-biphenyl]-2-yl)phosphine) and a base affords a compound of Formula 1. For example, a compound of Formula 22 wherein M3 is B(OH)2, B OC(CH3)2C(CH3)2O ) or B(O-i-Pr)3Li reacts with a 5-bromo- or 5-iodopyrazole of Formula 21 in the presence of dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(II) and an aqueous base such as sodium carbonate or potassium hydroxide, in solvents such as 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, toluene or ethyl alcohol, or under anhydrous conditions with the use of a ligand such as phosphine oxide or phosphite ligand (e.g., diphenylphosphine oxide) and potassium fluoride in a solvent such as 1,4-dioxane to provide a compound of Formula 1. For references, see Angewandte Chemie, International Edition 2008, 47(25), 4695-4698 and PCT Publication WO 2010/030922 A1 (Example 3, Step D).
Compounds of Formula 21 can be prepared via halogenation methods analogous to those described for Scheme 6 (for conditions see PCT Publication WO 2010/030922 A1, Example 3, Step C).
Compounds of Formula 1 can be subjected to various nucleophilic, metalation and oxidation reactions to add substituents or modify existing substituents, and thus provide other functionalized compounds of Formula 1. For example, as shown in Scheme 12, compounds of Formula 1e (i.e. Formula 1 wherein X in NR4 and R4 is other than H) can be prepared by reacting corresponding compounds of Formula 1f (i.e. Formula 1 wherein X is NH) with an electrophile comprising R4 (i.e. Formula 23) typically in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride and a polar solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide. In this context the expression “electrophile comprising R4” means a chemical compound capable of transferring an R4 moiety to a nucleophile (such as the nitrogen atom in Formula 1f). Often electrophiles comprising R4 have the formula R4L3 wherein L3 is a nucleofuge (i.e. leaving group in nucleophilic reactions). Typical nucleofuges include halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, I) and sulfonates (e.g., OS(O)2CH3, OS(O)2CF3, OS(O)2-(4-CH3-Ph)). However, some electrophiles comprising R4 do not comprise a nucleofuge; an example is sulfur trioxide (SO3) which, after deprotonation (such as by a base of the formula M+H− wherein M+ is a cation) of the nitrogen atom in Formula 1f, can bond to the nitrogen atom as a —S(═O)2OM substituent.
In another example, as shown in Scheme 13, a fluoro can be introduced at the 3-position of the pyrazole ring by treating compounds Formula 1h (i.e. Formula 1 wherein R2 is chlorine) with potassium fluoride or cesium fluoride in presence of a solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide or N,N-dimethylformamide at about 0-25° C. for about 30 minutes to 4 h, using procedures such as those described in Zhurnal Organicheskoi Khimii 1983, 19, 2164-2173.
Additionally, as shown in Scheme 14, sulfoxides and sulfones of Formula 1i (i.e. Formula 1 wherein X is S(═O)m and m is 1 or 2) can be prepared by oxidation of compounds of Formula 1a (i.e. Formula 1 wherein X is S). Typically, an oxidizing agent in an amount of about 1 to 4 equivalents, depending on the oxidation state of the desired product, is added to a mixture of a compound of Formula 1a and a solvent. Useful oxidizing agents include Oxone® (potassium peroxymonosulfate), potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide, sodium periodate, peracetic acid and 3-chloroperbenzoic acid. The solvent is selected with regard to the oxidizing agent employed. Aqueous ethanol or aqueous acetone is preferably used with potassium peroxymonosulfate, and dichloromethane is generally preferable with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid. Useful reaction temperatures typically range from about −78 to 90° C. Oxidation reactions of this type are described in J. Agric. Food Chem. 1984, 32, 221-226 and J. Agric. Food Chem. 2008, 56, 10160-10167.
Furthermore, for some compounds of Formula 1 the R3a and/or R3b substituents attached to Q1 and Q2 may be more conveniently incorporated after forming the central pyrazole ring with Q1 and Q2 already attached. For example, compounds of Formula 1j (i.e. Formula 1 wherein Q1 is phenyl and R3b is alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, cycloalkoxy, and the like) can be prepared by reacting hydroxyphenyl derivatives of Formula 24 with compounds of formula 25 wherein L2 is a suitable leaving group such as halogen or (halo)alkylsulfonate (e.g., Cl, Br, I, p-toluenesulfonate, methanesulfonate or trifluoromethanesulfonate), in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium hydride or triethylamine, and in an aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature between about −20 and 150° C. This reaction works particularly well when the hydroxy group (—OH) is in the 4-position of the phenyl ring of Formula 24 and at least one of the substituents R3a is an electron withdrawing group such as fluoride. For a reference describing the general method of Scheme 15 see Chemical & Pharmaceutical Bulletin 2008, 56(8), 1126-1137. The resulting alkoxy compounds of Formula 1j can themselves be used in further reactions to prepare compounds of Formula 1 wherein R3a is —U—V-T (see, for example, PCT Publication WO 2007/149448 A2).
As shown in Scheme 16, hydroxyphenyl derivatives of Formula 24 can be prepared from boronic acids or esters of Formula 26 via oxidative hydroxylation. A variety of oxidizing agents can be used in this method, particularly useful reagents include hydrogen peroxide and N-oxides such as N,N,4-trimethylbenzenamine N-oxide according to procedures reported in Tetrahedron Letters 2012, 53, 6004-6007 and Organic Letters 2012, 14(13), 3494-3497.
As shown in Scheme 17, the intermediate boronic acids or esters of Formula 26 can be prepared by contacting compounds of Formula 27 wherein L3 is Cl, Br, I or a triflate group with a boronic acid or ester of Formula 28. The reaction is carried out in the presence a palladium catalyst such as PdCl2dppf (PdCl2-1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) and a base such as potassium acetate in a solvent such as dioxane at about 80 to 100° C. The stoichiometry of this method requires at least one molar equivalent of the boronic acid or ester to obtain complete conversion of the compound of Formula 27 to the corresponding compound of Formula 26. However, to obtain rapid reaction rates and high yields, an excess of the boronic acid is typically used, often at least 1.5 to 2.0 molar equivalents relative to the compound of Formula 27. A wide variety of boronic acids, esters, and their derivatives can be used in the method of Scheme 17. Particularly useful derivatives include, for example, trialkoxy boranes such as trimethoxyborane. Coupling reactions with boronic acids or derivatives in the presence of palladium catalysts are known, and the wide variety of known general procedures can be readily adapted by one skilled in the art for use in the method of Scheme 17. For articles about this type of functional group transformation, see, for example, Tetrahedron 2000, 56, 9655-9662 and Chemical Communications 2004, 1, 38.
Analogous to the method of Scheme 17, compounds of Formula 27 can be contacted with bis(pinacolato)diboron (i.e. Formula 29) to provide compounds of Formula 30. Compounds of Formula 30 can also be used in the method of Scheme 16 to provide hydroxyphenyl derivatives of Formula 24. For a reference describing the general method of Scheme 18 see Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 2011, 19, 2997-3004.
One skilled in the art recognizes that the construction of R3b attached to Q1 in the methods of Schemes 15-18 can alternatively be performed for the construction of R3b attached to Q2. Therefore the methods described in Schemes 15-18 should be considered broadly useful for the construction of R3b attached to Q1 and for the construction of R3b attached Q2. Furthermore, the methods of Schemes 15-18 can also be performed when Q1 or Q2 is other then phenyl.
One skilled in the art will also recognize that the methods of Schemes 15-18 can alternatively be carried out at other stages in the preparation of pyrazoles of Formula 1. For example, as shown in Scheme 19, using a method analogous to Scheme 15 compounds of Formula 31 can be prepared (present Example 2, Step C and Example 3, Step A illustrate the preparation of a compound of Formula 31 using the method Scheme 15), and then subsequently reduced using the method described in Scheme 2 or alkylated using the method described in Scheme 3 to provide compounds of Formula 1j wherein X is CH(OH) or C(OH)R5a and R5a is other then H, respectively.
Numerous other methods known to those skilled in the art can be employed for the construction of an R3b group attached to Q1 or Q2. For example, as depicted in Scheme 20, compounds of Formula 1k (i.e. Formula 1 wherein Q1 is phenyl, R3b is W and W is a heterocycle linked through nitrogen) can be prepared from compounds of Formula 32 wherein L3 is Cl, Br, I or a triflate group with heterocycles of Formula 33 using Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reaction conditions. Typically these reactions are conducted in an inert solvent in the presence of a suitable ligand, a copper (I) salt (e.g., CuI or CuBr) and a base (e.g., sodium or potassium carbonate) at about ambient temperature to 230° C. for about 1 to 48 h. Typical ligands include 1,2-diaminocyclohexane and phenanthroline. Suitable solvents include dioxane, 1,2-diethoxyethane and toluene. Conditions for Buchwald-Hartwig couplings are well documented in the literature, see for example, Tetrahedron Letters, 2010, 52(38), 5052 and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2010, 53(10), 31-8.
Alternatively, as shown in Scheme 21 (Method A), compounds of Formula 1k (i.e. Formula 1 wherein Q1 is phenyl, R3b is W and W is a heterocycle linked through nitrogen) can be prepared from boronic acids or esters of Formula 26 and compounds of Formula 33 using Chan-Lam coupling conditions. Typically the reaction is run in presence of a Cu(II) salt, oxygen, and a base at about ambient temperature to 150° C. for about 24 to 72 h. Suitable Cu(II) salts include are Cu(OAc)2, CuBr2 and CuI2, suitable bases include pyridine, quinoline and triethylamine, and suitable solvents include dichloromethane, chloroform, diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. For representative conditions see Tetrahedron Letters, 1998, 38, 2941 and PCT Patent Publication WO 2003/072547.
As depicted in Scheme 21 (Method B), preparation of compounds of Formula 1m (i.e. Formula 1 wherein Q1 is phenyl, R3b is W, and W is a heterocycle linked through carbon) can be accomplished via the well-known Suzuki reaction involving Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling of an heterocyclic iodide or bromide of Formula 34 with a boronic acid of Formula 26. Many palladium catalysts are useful for this type of transformation; a typical catalyst is tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0). Solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, diethyl ether and dioxane are suitable. For a thorough review of palladium chemistry see Li, J. J.; Gribble, G. W.; Editors; Palladium in Heterocyclic Chemistry: A Guide for the Synthetic Chemist, Elsevier: Oxford, U K, 2000. For representative journal references, see, for example, Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 2006, 45, 3484 and Tetrahedron Letters, 2002, 58(14), 2885. Cyclic boronates of Formula 30 are also useful in the method of Scheme 21.
One skilled in the art recognizes that the construction of R3b attached to Q1 in the methods of Schemes 20 and 21 can alternatively be performed for the construction of R3b attached to Q2. Therefore the methods described in Schemes 20 and 21 should be considered broadly useful for construction of R3b attached to either Q1 or Q2.
Furthermore, a wide variety of alternative methods exist for the construction of other R3b groups, including well documented functional group transformations of ketones, esters, acids, aldehydes, nitriles and the like. For example, as depicted in Scheme 22, reaction of an aldehyde or ketone of Formula 35 with a hydrazine of Formula 36 provides compounds of Formula 1n (i.e. Formula 1 wherein Q1 is phenyl and R3a is —CR10c═NNR9aR9b). For leading references teaching this method see Tetrahedron 2000, 56(41), 8071-8076, Journal of Organic Chemistry 2005, 70(2), 596-602 and Synthetic Communications 1997, 27(7), 1199-1207.
Aldehydes and ketones of Formula 35 can be prepared from the corresponding bromo, iodo or triflate derivatives via transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. For conditions see J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2008, 130, 15549-15563, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2003, 46, 5651-5662 and Tetrahedron 2003, 59, 8199-8202.
Additionally, it will be recognized by one skilled in the art that various functional groups can be converted into others to provide different compounds of Formula 1. For example, compounds of Formula 1 in which R2 is methyl, ethyl or cyclopropyl can be modified by free-radical halogenation to form compounds of Formula 1 wherein R2 is halomethyl or halocyclopropyl. The halomethyl compounds can themselves be used as intermediates to prepare compounds of Formula 1 wherein R2 is hydroxymethyl or cyanomethyl. Compounds of Formula 1 or intermediates for their preparation may contain aromatic nitro groups, which can be reduced to amino groups, and then be converted via reactions well-known in the art, such as the Sandmeyer reaction, to various halides, providing other compounds of Formula 1. By similarly known reactions, aromatic amines (anilines) can be converted via diazonium salts to phenols, which can then be alkylated to prepare compounds of Formula 1 with alkoxy substituents. Likewise, aromatic halides such as bromides or iodides, prepared via the Sandmeyer reaction, can be reacted with alcohols under copper-catalyzed conditions, such as the Ullmann reaction or known modifications thereof, to provide compounds of Formula 1 that contain alkoxy substituents. Additionally, some halogen groups, such as fluorine or chlorine, can be displaced with alcohols under basic conditions to provide compounds of Formula 1 containing the corresponding alkoxy substituents. Compounds of Formula 1, or precursors thereof, in which R2 is halide, preferably bromide or iodide, are particularly useful intermediates for transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions to prepare compounds of Formula 1. These types of reactions are well documented in the literature; see, for example, Tsuji in Transition Metal Reagents and Catalysts: Innovations in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, 2002; Tsuji in Palladium in Organic Synthesis, Springer, 2005; and Miyaura and Buchwald in Cross Coupling Reactions: A Practical Guide, 2002; and references cited therein.
It is recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions described above for preparing compounds of Formula 1 may not be compatible with certain functionalities present in the intermediates. In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection sequences or functional group interconversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis (see, for example, Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991). One skilled in the art will recognize that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as it is depicted in any individual scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthetic steps not described in detail to complete the synthesis of compounds of Formula 1. One skilled in the art will also recognize that it may be necessary to perform a combination of the steps illustrated in the above schemes in an order other than that implied by the particular sequence presented to prepare the compounds of Formula 1.
The above reactions can also in many cases be performed in alternate sequence, such as the preparation of 1H pyrazoles for use in the reaction in Scheme 7 by reactions illustrated later for the general preparation of substituted pyrazoles. The presence of certain functional groups may not be compatible with all of these reaction conditions, and the use of protecting groups may be desirable for obtaining the desired products with improved yields and or purity.

The present disclosure also includes Tables 1B through 215B, each of which is constructed the same as Table 2 above, except that the row heading in Table 2 (i.e. “Q2 is 2,4,6-tri-F-Ph, (R3a)p is 2,6-di-F”) is replaced with the respective row headings shown below. For Example, in Table 1B the row heading is “Q2 is 2,4,6-tri-F-Ph, (R3a)p is 2-F”, and R3b is as defined in Table 2 above. Thus, the first entry in Table 1B specifically discloses 5-[2-fluoro-4-(-propyn-1-yloxy)phenyl]-1,3-dimethyl-α-(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-methanol. Tables 2B through 215B are constructed similarly.

The present disclosure also includes Tables 1C through 215C, each of which is constructed the same as Table 3 above, except that the row heading in Table 3 (i.e. “Q2 is 2,4,6-tri-F-Ph, (R3a)p is 2,6-di-F”) is replaced with the respective row headings shown below. For Example, in Table 1C the row heading is “Q2 is 2,4,6-tri-F-Ph, (R3a)p is 2-F”, and R3b is as defined in Table 3 above. Thus, the first entry in Table 1C specifically discloses 5-[2-fluoro-4-(-propyn-1-yloxy)phenyl]-1,3-dimethyl-4-[(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)-methyl]-1H-pyrazole. Tables 2C through 215C are constructed similarly.

Formulation/Utility
A compound of this invention will generally be used as a fungicidal active ingredient in a composition, i.e. formulation, with at least one additional component selected from the group consisting of surfactants, solid diluents and liquid diluents, which serve as a carrier. The formulation or composition ingredients are selected to be consistent with the physical properties of the active ingredient, mode of application and environmental factors such as soil type, moisture and temperature.
Useful formulations include both liquid and solid compositions. Liquid compositions include solutions (including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions, emulsions (including microemulsions and/or suspoemulsions) and the like, which optionally can be thickened into gels. The general types of aqueous liquid compositions are soluble concentrate, suspension concentrate, capsule suspension, concentrated emulsion, microemulsion and suspo-emulsion. The general types of nonaqueous liquid compositions are emulsifiable concentrate, microemulsifiable concentrate, dispersible concentrate and oil dispersion.
The general types of solid compositions are dusts, powders, granules, pellets, prills, pastilles, tablets, filled films (including seed coatings) and the like, which can be water-dispersible (“wettable”) or water-soluble. Films and coatings formed from film-forming solutions or flowable suspensions are particularly useful for seed treatment. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active ingredient can be encapsulated (or “overcoated”). Encapsulation can control or delay release of the active ingredient. An emulsifiable granule combines the advantages of both an emulsifiable concentrate formulation and a dry granular formulation. High-strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation.
Sprayable formulations are typically extended in a suitable medium before spraying. Such liquid and solid formulations are formulated to be readily diluted in the spray medium, usually water. Spray volumes can range from about one to several thousand liters per hectare, but more typically are in the range from about ten to several hundred liters per hectare. Sprayable formulations can be tank mixed with water or another suitable medium for foliar treatment by aerial or ground application, or for application to the growing medium of the plant. Liquid and dry formulations can be metered directly into drip irrigation systems or metered into the furrow during planting. Liquid and solid formulations can be applied onto seeds of crops and other desirable vegetation as seed treatments before planting to protect developing roots and other subterranean plant parts and/or foliage through systemic uptake.
The formulations will typically contain effective amounts of active ingredient, diluent and surfactant within the following approximate ranges which add up to 100 percent by weight.

Typical liquid diluents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950.
The solid and liquid compositions of the present invention often include one or more surfactants. When added to a liquid, surfactants (also known as “surface-active agents”) generally modify, most often reduce, the surface tension of the liquid. Depending on the nature of the hydrophilic and lipophilic groups in a surfactant molecule, surfactants can be useful as wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers or defoaming agents.
Surfactants can be classified as nonionic, anionic or cationic. Nonionic surfactants useful for the present compositions include, but are not limited to: alcohol alkoxylates such as alcohol alkoxylates based on natural and synthetic alcohols (which may be branched or linear) and prepared from the alcohols and ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or mixtures thereof; amine ethoxylates, alkanolamides and ethoxylated alkanolamides; alkoxylated triglycerides such as ethoxylated soybean, castor and rapeseed oils; alkylphenol alkoxylates such as octylphenol ethoxylates, nonylphenol ethoxylates, dinonyl phenol ethoxylates and dodecyl phenol ethoxylates (prepared from the phenols and ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or mixtures thereof); block polymers prepared from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide and reverse block polymers where the terminal blocks are prepared from propylene oxide; ethoxylated fatty acids; ethoxylated fatty esters and oils; ethoxylated methyl esters; ethoxylated tristyrylphenol (including those prepared from ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or mixtures thereof); fatty acid esters, glycerol esters, lanolin-based derivatives, polyethoxylate esters such as polyethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyethoxylated sorbitol fatty acid esters and polyethoxylated glycerol fatty acid esters; other sorbitan derivatives such as sorbitan esters; polymeric surfactants such as random copolymers, block copolymers, alkyd peg (polyethylene glycol) resins, graft or comb polymers and star polymers; polyethylene glycols (pegs); polyethylene glycol fatty acid esters; silicone-based surfactants; and sugar-derivatives such as sucrose esters, alkyl polyglycosides and alkyl polysaccharides.

Also useful for the present compositions are mixtures of nonionic and anionic surfactants or mixtures of nonionic and cationic surfactants. Nonionic, anionic and cationic surfactants and their recommended uses are disclosed in a variety of published references including McCutcheon's Emulsifiers and Detergents, annual American and International Editions published by McCutcheon's Division, The Manufacturing Confectioner Publishing Co.; Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents, Chemical Publ. Co., Inc., New York, 1964; and A. S. Davidson and B. Milwidsky, Synthetic Detergents, Seventh Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1987.
Compositions of this invention may also contain formulation auxiliaries and additives, known to those skilled in the art as formulation aids (some of which may be considered to also function as solid diluents, liquid diluents or surfactants). Such formulation auxiliaries and additives may control: pH (buffers), foaming during processing (antifoams such polyorganosiloxanes), sedimentation of active ingredients (suspending agents), viscosity (thixotropic thickeners), in-container microbial growth (antimicrobials), product freezing (antifreezes), color (dyes/pigment dispersions), wash-off (film formers or stickers), evaporation (evaporation retardants), and other formulation attributes. Film formers include, for example, polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl acetate copolymers, polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers and waxes. Examples of formulation auxiliaries and additives include those listed in McCutcheon's Volume 2: Functional Materials, annual International and North American editions published by McCutcheon's Division, The Manufacturing Confectioner Publishing Co.; and PCT Publication WO 03/024222.
The compound of Formula 1 and any other active ingredients are typically incorporated into the present compositions by dissolving the active ingredient in a solvent or by grinding in a liquid or dry diluent. Solutions, including emulsifiable concentrates, can be prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. If the solvent of a liquid composition intended for use as an emulsifiable concentrate is water-immiscible, an emulsifier is typically added to emulsify the active-containing solvent upon dilution with water. Active ingredient slurries, with particle diameters of up to 2,000 μm can be wet milled using media mills to obtain particles with average diameters below 3 μm. Aqueous slurries can be made into finished suspension concentrates (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,060,084) or further processed by spray drying to form water-dispersible granules. Dry formulations usually require dry milling processes, which produce average particle diameters in the 2 to 10 μm range. Dusts and powders can be prepared by blending and usually grinding (such as with a hammer mill or fluid-energy mill). Granules and pellets can be prepared by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See Browning, “Agglomeration”, Chemical Engineering, Dec. 4, 1967, pp 147-48, Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook, 4th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1963, pages 8-57 and following, and WO 91/13546. Pellets can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,172,714. Water-dispersible and water-soluble granules can be prepared as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,144,050, U.S. Pat. No. 3,920,442 and DE 3,246,493. Tablets can be prepared as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,180,587, U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,701 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,030. Films can be prepared as taught in GB 2,095,558 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,299,566.

Water-soluble and water-dispersible formulations are typically diluted with water to form aqueous compositions before application. Aqueous compositions for direct applications to the plant or portion thereof (e.g., spray tank compositions) typically at least about 1 ppm or more (e.g., from 1 ppm to 100 ppm) of the compound(s) of this invention.
The compounds of this invention are useful as plant disease control agents. The present invention therefore further comprises a method for controlling plant diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens comprising applying to the plant or portion thereof to be protected, or to the plant seed to be protected, an effective amount of a compound of the invention or a fungicidal composition containing said compound. The compounds and/or compositions of this invention provide control of diseases caused by a broad spectrum of fungal plant pathogens in the Basidiomycete, Ascomycete, Oomycete and Deuteromycete classes. They are effective in controlling a broad spectrum of plant diseases, particularly foliar pathogens of ornamental, turf, vegetable, field, cereal, and fruit crops. These pathogens include: Oomycetes, including Phytophthora diseases such as Phytophthora infestans, Phytophthora megasperma, Phytophthora parasitica, Phytophthora cinnamomi and Phytophthora capsici, Pythium diseases such as Pythium aphanidermatum, and diseases in the Peronosporaceae family such as Plasmopara viticola, Peronospora spp. (including Peronospora tabacina and Peronospora parasitica), Pseudoperonospora spp. (including Pseudoperonospora cubensis) and Bremia lactucae; Ascomycetes, including Alternaria diseases such as Alternaria solani and Alternaria brassicae, Guignardia diseases such as Guignardia bidwell, Venturia diseases such as Venturia inaequalis, Septoria diseases such as Septoria nodorum and Septoria tritici, powdery mildew diseases such as Erysiphe spp. (including Erysiphe graminis and Erysiphe polygoni), Uncinula necatur, Sphaerotheca fuliginea, Podosphaera leucotricha and Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides, Botrytis diseases such as Botrytis cinerea, Monilinia fructicola, Sclerotinia diseases such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Sclerotinia minor, Magnaporthe grisea, and Phomopsis viticola, Helminthosporium diseases such as Helminthosporium tritici repentis and Pyrenophora teres, anthracnose diseases such as Glomerella or Colletotrichum spp. (such as Colletotrichum graminicola and Colletotrichum orbiculare), and Gaeumannomyces graminis; Basidiomycetes, including rust diseases caused by Puccinia spp. (such as Puccinia recondita, Puccinia striiformis, Puccinia hordei, Puccinia graminis and Puccinia arachidis), Hemileia vastatrix and Phakopsora pachyrhizi; other pathogens including Rutstroemia floccosum (also known as Sclerotinia homoeocarpa); Rhizoctonia spp. (such as Rhizoctonia solani); Fusarium diseases such as Fusarium roseum, Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium oxysporum Verticillium dahliae; Sclerotium rolfsii; Rynchosporium secalis; Cercosporidium personatum, Cercospora arachidicola and Cercospora beticola; Rhizopus spp. (such as Rhizopus stolonifer); Aspergillus spp. (such as Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus); and other genera and species closely related to these pathogens. In addition to their fungicidal activity, the compositions or combinations also have activity against bacteria such as Erwinia amylovora, Xanthomonas campestris, Pseudomonas syringae, and other related species. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are useful in treating postharvest diseases of fruits and vegetables caused by fungi and bacteria. These infections can occur before, during and after harvest. For example, infections can occur before harvest and then remain dormant until some point during ripening (e.g., host begins tissue changes in such a way that infection can progress); also infections can arise from surface wounds created by mechanical or insect injury. In this respect, the compounds of this invention can reduce losses (i.e. losses resulting from quantity and quality) due to postharvest diseases which may occur at any time from harvest to consumption. Treatment of postharvest diseases with compounds of the invention can increase the period of time during which perishable edible plant parts (e.g, fruits, seeds, foliage, stems, bulbs, tubers) can be stored refrigerated or un-refrigerated after harvest, and remain edible and free from noticeable or harmful degradation or contamination by fungi or other microorganisms. Treatment of edible plant parts before or after harvest with compounds of the invention can also decrease the formation of toxic metabolites of fungi or other microorganisms, for example, mycotoxins such as aflatoxins.
Plant disease control is ordinarily accomplished by applying an effective amount of a compound of this invention either pre- or post-infection, to the portion of the plant to be protected such as the roots, stems, foliage, fruits, seeds, tubers or bulbs, or to the media (soil or sand) in which the plants to be protected are growing. The compounds can also be applied to seeds to protect the seeds and seedlings developing from the seeds. The compounds can also be applied through irrigation water to treat plants. Control of postharvest pathogens which infect the produce before harvest is typically accomplished by field application of a compound of this invention, and in cases where infection occurs after harvest the compounds can be applied to the harvested crop as dips, sprays, fumigants, treated wraps and box liners.
Rates of application for these compounds (i.e. a fungicidally effective amount) can be influenced by factors such as the plant diseases to be controlled, the plant species to be protected, ambient moisture and temperature and should be determined under actual use conditions. One skilled in the art can easily determine through simple experimentation the fungicidally effective amount necessary for the desired level of plant disease control. Foliage can normally be protected when treated at a rate of from less than about 1 g/ha to about 5,000 g/ha of active ingredient. Seed and seedlings can normally be protected when seed is treated at a rate of from about 0.1 to about 10 g per kilogram of seed.
Compounds of this invention can also be mixed with one or more other biologically active compounds or agents including fungicides, insecticides, nematocides, bactericides, acaricides, herbicides, herbicide safeners, growth regulators such as insect molting inhibitors and rooting stimulants, chemosterilants, semiochemicals, repellents, attractants, pheromones, feeding stimulants, plant nutrients, other biologically active compounds or entomopathogenic bacteria, virus or fungi to form a multi-component pesticide giving an even broader spectrum of agricultural protection. Thus the present invention also pertains to a composition comprising a compound of Formula 1 (in a fungicidally effective amount) and at least one additional biologically active compound or agent (in a biologically effective amount) and can further comprise at least one of a surfactant, a solid diluent or a liquid diluent. The other biologically active compounds or agents can be formulated in compositions comprising at least one of a surfactant, solid or liquid diluent. For mixtures of the present invention, one or more other biologically active compounds or agents can be formulated together with a compound of Formula 1, to form a premix, or one or more other biologically active compounds or agents can be formulated separately from the compound of Formula 1, and the formulations combined together before application (e.g., in a spray tank) or, alternatively, applied in succession.
Of note is a composition which in addition to the compound of Formula 1 include at least one fungicidal compound selected from the group consisting of the classes (1) methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC) fungicides; (2) dicarboximide fungicides; (3) demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides; (4) phenylamide fungicides; (5) amine/morpholine fungicides; (6) phospholipid biosynthesis inhibitor fungicides; (7) carboxamide fungicides; (8) hydroxy(2-amino-)pyrimidine fungicides; (9) anilinopyrimidine fungicides; (10) N-phenyl carbamate fungicides; (11) quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicides; (12) phenylpyrrole fungicides; (13) quinoline fungicides; (14) lipid peroxidation inhibitor fungicides; (15) melanin biosynthesis inhibitors-reductase (MBI-R) fungicides; (16) melanin biosynthesis inhibitors-dehydratase (MBI-D) fungicides; (17) hydroxyanilide fungicides; (18) squalene-epoxidase inhibitor fungicides; (19) polyoxin fungicides; (20) phenylurea fungicides; (21) quinone inside inhibitor (QiI) fungicides; (22) benzamide fungicides; (23) enopyranuronic acid antibiotic fungicides; (24) hexopyranosyl antibiotic fungicides; (25) glucopyranosyl antibiotic: protein synthesis fungicides; (26) glucopyranosyl antibiotic: trehalase and inositol biosynthesis fungicides; (27) cyanoacetamideoxime fungicides; (28) carbamate fungicides; (29) oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling fungicides; (30) organo tin fungicides; (31) carboxylic acid fungicides; (32) heteroaromatic fungicides; (33) phosphonate fungicides; (34) phthalamic acid fungicides; (35) benzotriazine fungicides; (36) benzene-sulfonamide fungicides; (37) pyridazinone fungicides; (38) thiophene-carboxamide fungicides; (39) pyrimidinamide fungicides; (40) carboxylic acid amide (CAA) fungicides; (41) tetracycline antibiotic fungicides; (42) thiocarbamate fungicides; (43) benzamide fungicides; (44) host plant defense induction fungicides; (45) multi-site contact activity fungicides; (46) fungicides other than classes (1) through (45); and salts of compounds of classes (1) through (46).
Further descriptions of these classes of fungicidal compounds are provided below.
(1) “Methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC) fungicides” (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) code 1) inhibit mitosis by binding to β-tubulin during microtubule assembly. Inhibition of microtubule assembly can disrupt cell division, transport within the cell and cell structure. Methyl benzimidazole carbamate fungicides include benzimidazoles and thiophanates. The benzimidazoles include benomyl, carbendazim, fuberidazole and thiabendazole. The thiophanates include thiophanate and thiophanate-methyl.
(2) “Dicarboximide fungicides” (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) code 2) are proposed to inhibit a lipid peroxidation in fungi through interference with NADH cytochrome c reductase. Examples include chlozolinate, iprodione, procymidone and vinclozolin.
(3) “Demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides” (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) code 3) inhibit C14-demethylase, which plays a role in sterol production. Sterols, such as ergosterol, are needed for membrane structure and function, making them essential for the development of functional cell walls. Therefore, exposure to these fungicides results in abnormal growth and eventually death of sensitive fungi. Demethylation fungicides include piperazines, pyridines, pyrimidines, imidazoles and triazoles. The piperazines include triforine. The pyridines include buthiobate and pyrifenox. The pyrimidines include fenarimol, nuarimol and triarimol. The imidazoles include clotrimazole, imazalil, oxpoconazole, prochloraz, pefurazoate and triflumizole. The triazoles include azaconazole, bitertanol, bromuconazole, cyproconazole, difenoconazole, diniconazole (including diniconazole-M), epoxiconazole, etaconazole, fenbuconazole, fluquinconazole, flusilazole, flutriafol, hexaconazole, imibenconazole, ipconazole, metconazole, myclobutanil, penconazole, propiconazole, prothioconazole, quinconazole, simeconazole, tebuconazole, tetraconazole, triadimefon, triadimenol, triticonazole, uniconazole, 1-[[(2S,3R)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-oxiranyl]methyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole, 2-[[(2S,3R)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-oxiranyl]methyl]-1,2-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione and 1-[[(2S,3R)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-oxiranyl]methyl]-5-(2-propen-1-ylthio)-1H-1,2,4-triazole. The imidazoles include clotrimazole, imazalil, oxpoconazole, prochloraz, pefurazoate and triflumizole. Biochemical investigations have shown that all of the above mentioned fungicides are DMI fungicides as described by K. H. Kuck et al. in Modern Selective Fungicides—Properties, Applications and Mechanisms of Action, H. Lyr (Ed.), Gustav Fischer Verlag: New York, 1995, 205-258.
(4) “Phenylamide fungicides” (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) code 4) are specific inhibitors of RNA polymerase in Oomycete fungi.

Tomlin, Ed., British Crop Protection Council, Farnham, Surrey, U. K., 2003 and The BioPesticide Manual, 2nd Edition, L. G. Copping, Ed., British Crop Protection Council, Farnham, Surrey, U. K., 2001.
For embodiments where one or more of these various mixing partners are used, the weight ratio of these various mixing partners (in total) to the compound of Formula 1 is typically between about 1:3000 and about 3000:1. Of note are weight ratios between about 1:300 and about 300:1 (for example ratios between about 1:30 and about 30:1). One skilled in the art can easily determine through simple experimentation the biologically effective amounts of active ingredients necessary for the desired spectrum of biological activity. It will be evident that including these additional components may expand the spectrum of diseases controlled beyond the spectrum controlled by the compound of Formula 1 alone.
In certain instances, combinations of a compound of this invention with other biologically active (particularly fungicidal) compounds or agents (i.e. active ingredients) can result in a greater-than-additive (i.e. synergistic) effect. Reducing the quantity of active ingredients released in the environment while ensuring effective pest control is always desirable. When synergism of fungicidal active ingredients occurs at application rates giving agronomically satisfactory levels of fungal control, such combinations can be advantageous for reducing crop production cost and decreasing environmental load.
Of note is a combination of a compound of Formula 1 with at least one other fungicidal active ingredient. Of particular note is such a combination where the other fungicidal active ingredient has different site of action from the compound of Formula 1. In certain instances, a combination with at least one other fungicidal active ingredient having a similar spectrum of control but a different site of action will be particularly advantageous for resistance management. Thus, a composition of the present invention can further comprise a biologically effective amount of at least one additional fungicidal active ingredient having a similar spectrum of control but a different site of action.

Further descriptions of classes of fungicidal compounds are provided below.
Sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (group (27)) control fungi by inhibiting enzymes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Demethylase-inhibiting fungicides have a common site of action within the fungal sterol biosynthesis pathway, involving inhibition of demethylation at position 14 of lanosterol or 24-methylene dihydrolanosterol, which are precursors to sterols in fungi. Compounds acting at this site are often referred to as demethylase inhibitors, DMI fungicides, or DMIs. The demethylase enzyme is sometimes referred to by other names in the biochemical literature, including cytochrome P-450 (14DM). The demethylase enzyme is described in, for example, J. Biol. Chem. 1992, 267, 13175-79 and references cited therein. DMI fungicides are divided between several chemical classes: azoles (including triazoles and imidazoles), pyrimidines, piperazines and pyridines.

Biochemical investigations have shown that all of the above mentioned fungicides are DMI fungicides as described by K. H. Kuck et al. in Modern Selective Fungicides-Properties, Applications and Mechanisms of Action, H. Lyr (Ed.), Gustav Fischer Verlag: New York, 1995, 205-258.

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION
General protocol for preparing test suspensions for Tests A-E: the test compounds were first dissolved in acetone in an amount equal to 3% of the final volume and then suspended at the desired concentration (in ppm) in acetone and purified water (50/50 mix by volume) containing 250 ppm of the surfactant Trem® 014 (polyhydric alcohol esters). The resulting test suspensions were then used in Tests A-E. Spraying a 200 ppm test suspension to the point of run-off on the test plants was the equivalent of a rate of 800 g/ha.
Test A
The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on wheat seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici (the causal agent of wheat leaf rust) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20° C. for 24 h, and then moved to a growth chamber at 20° C. for 6 days, after which time visual disease ratings were made.
Test B
The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on wheat seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Septoria tritici (the causal agent of wheat leaf blotch) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 24° C. for 48 h, and then moved to a growth chamber at 20° C. for 19 days, after which time visual disease ratings were made.
Test C
The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on tomato seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Botrytis cinerea (the causal agent of tomato Botrytis) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20° C. for 48 h, and then moved to a growth chamber at 24° C. for 3 days, after which time visual disease ratings were made.
Test D
The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on wheat seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore dust of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, also known as Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici (the causal agent of wheat powdery mildew) and incubated in a growth chamber at 20° C. for 8 days, after which time visual disease ratings were made.
Test E
The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on wheat seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Septoria nodorum (the causal agent of Septoria glume blotch) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 24° C. for 48 h, and then moved to a growth chamber at 20° C. for 9 days, after which time visual disease ratings were made.
Results for Tests A-E are given in Table A. In the Table, a rating of 100 indicates 100% disease control and a rating of 0 indicates no disease control (relative to the controls). All results are for compounds tested at 200 ppm except where followed by an asterisk “*” which indicates the compound was tested at 250 ppm. A dash (-) indicates no test results.  TABLE A
