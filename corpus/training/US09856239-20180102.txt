TECHNICAL FIELD
The invention relates to pharmaceutical technical field, specifically, to carboxylic acid compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs, and solvates thereof and preparation methods thereof, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same and uses thereof.
BACKGROUND TECHNIQUE
Uric acid is the final metabolite of diet and purine in human body. In vivo environment (pH 7.4, 37 degrees), uric acid is present in blood mainly in the form of sodium salt of uric acid, the serum uric acid value of normal people is generally lower than 6 mg/dL. When uric acid in serum exceeds 7 mg/dL (Shi, et al., Nature 2003, 425: 516-523), sodium salt of uric acid will crystallize out and precipitate on joints and other parts of the body, and result in disorders such as gout, urinary stones, kidney stones, etc. Patients with gout are often accompanied with other complications, including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, obesity, metabolic disease, nephropathy, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease, etc. (Rock, Et al., Nature Reviews Rheumatology 2013, 9: 13-23). In 2002, Japanese scientists Endou group reported that anion transport channel protein URAT1 is a major protein responsible for reabsorption of uric acid in kidney, they also found that the blood uric acid in people with URAT1 gene mutation (causing the synthesis of such protein being interrupted, inducing nonfunctional proteins) is only one-tenth of that in normal people (Enomoto et. al., Nature 2002 417: 447-452). These findings in human genetics demonstrate that URAT1 anion transport protein in kidney plays very important role in concentration of uric acid in blood, and indicates that URAT1 is a very good and specific target of a drug for reducing blood uric acid.
The main objective in the treatment of gout and its complications caused by higher level of blood uric acid is to reduce blood uric acid to lower than 6 mg/dL, the main methods are as follows: 1) to inhibit the generation of uric acid, such as allopurinol, febuxostat, which are drugs for inhibiting Xanthine oxidase; 2) to inhibit the reabsorption of uric acid, such as benzbromarone and probenecid, and lesinurad which is currently in clinical research, all of which are drugs for inhibiting kidney URAT1 anion transport channel protein.
In addition to URAT1, there are other cation transport channel proteins in kidney, such as Glut9 and OAT1 etc., which are also found to be able to reabsorb uric acid back to blood from renal tubules. Kidney is a major excretion pathway of uric acid in human body (70%), intestinal system (via ABCG2 etc.,) is responsible for excreting approximate 30% of uric acid (Sakurai, et. al., Current Opinion in Nephology and Hypertension 2013, 22: 545-550).
Human urate anion transporter 1, hURAT1, a member of anion transporter family, is located at luminal surface side of epithelial cells of renal proximal convoluted tubules, mainly participates in the reabsorption of uric acid in renal proximal convoluted tubules. URAT1 accomplishes reabsorption of uric acid and excretion of small amount of uric acid by exchanging univalent anions within cells with uric acid in lumens. Anion transport channel proteins located in renal proximal convoluted tubules also comprise anion transport channel protein OAT4, which has 42% of similarity with URAT1 (amino acids of protein). Therefore, generally, a potent URAT1 inhibitor will also inhibit OAT4 and some other anion transport channel proteins.
At present, all the clinical drugs for reducing blood uric acid have some side effects, for example, allopurinol will cause life-threatening hypersensitivity in some populations, febuxostat has cardiovascular side effects, and benzbromarone has liver toxicity and has been taken back by Sanofi from some markets. Therefore, it is urgent to search for novel, efficient and low-toxic drugs for reducing blood uric acid, and this will have great clinical significance and application prospects.
Thioacetate compounds have been reported in the prior art, e.g., a class of phenylthioacetate compounds were reported in CN102939279A, a class of thioacetate compounds were reported in CN103068801A, wherein thioacetate compounds in CN103068801A are obtained from the compounds in CN102939279A by essentially replacing carbons of benzene groups in skeletons of the compounds in CN102939279A with 1 to 4 N atoms.
Since categories of drugs for gout treatment are very limited in market, it is important to develop anti-gout drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity.

Experimental Example 1: Evaluation of Bioactivity of Chemicals for Inhibiting Absorption of Uric Acid Using URAT1 Cell Model
Human kidney embryonic cells HEK-293T were grown in a petri dish (diameter=10 cm) containing DMEM and 10% of bovine fetal serum culture solution, and incubated in an 5% of carbon dioxide-containing incubator at 37° C. Plasmids carrying human URAT1 were transfected to HEK-293T cells using TransIT-293 (Mirus Bio LLC). After 72 hours, the petri dish containing HEK-293T cells transfected with URAT1 was removed from the incubator and the cells were inoculated on Poly-D-Lysine Coated 96-well Plates at a density of 60,000 cells per well. After the cells on the 96-well plates were grown overnight (at least 12 hours) in an incubator at 37 degrees, these cells were gently rinsed 3 times with warm and no chloride ions-containing HBSS buffer (125 mM sodium gluconate, 4.8 mM potassium gluconate, 1.3 mM calcium gluconate, 1.2 mM monopotassium phosphate, 1.2 mM magnesium sulfate, 5.6 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). 50 microliter of HBSS buffer (not containing chloride ions) containing 0.2 microcurie of 14C-uric acid and compounds of the present application or benzbromarone, and vector was added in each well, then the cell plates were put back to the incubator at 37 degrees. After 5 min, the buffer was removed from cell wells, added with 100 microliter of ice-cold and no chloride ions-containing HBSS buffer to gently rinse cells within wells so as to stop them from absorbing 14C-uric acid, the rinsing was repeated 3 times in the same manner. 150 microliter of cell lysate (100 mM of NaOH) was added in each well. Cell plate was placed on a vibrating plate and vibrated for 10 min at a speed of 600 rpm such that the cells were completely lysed. The cell plate was put in a centrifuge and spun for 5 min at a speed of 1000 rpm, then 45 microliter of supernatant was sucked out from each well and transferred to 96-well plate (Isoplate-96 Microplate from PerkinElmer). In the new 96-well plate, 150 microliter of Ultima Gold XR scintillation solution was added in each well. The 96-well plate was vibrated for 10 min at a speed of 600 rpm on a vibrating plate. Finally, the 96-well plate was put in a MicroBeta Trilux Counter from PerkinElmer and was read, then IC50 values were calculated, and the results are shown in Table 1 below. Wherein  TABLE 1
