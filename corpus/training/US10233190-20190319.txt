Summary of the Related Art
Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid required for the biosynthesis of proteins, niacin and the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (also known as INDO or IDO) catalyzes the first and rate limiting step in the degradation of L-tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine. In human cells, IFN-γ stimulation induces activation of IDO, which leads to a depletion of Trp, thereby arresting the growth of Trp-dependent intracellular pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii and Chlamydia trachomatis. IDO activity also has an antiproliferative effect on many tumor cells, and IDO induction has been observed in vivo during rejection of allogeneic tumors, indicating a possible role for this enzyme in the tumor rejection process.
It has been observed that HeLa cells co-cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) acquire an immunoinhibitory phenotype through up-regulation of IDO activity. A reduction in PBL proliferation upon treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2) was believed to result from IDO released by the tumor cells in response to IFN-γ secretion by the PBLs. This effect was reversed by treatment with 1-methyl-tryptophan (1MT), a specific IDO inhibitor. It was proposed that IDO activity in tumor cells may serve to impair antitumor responses (Logan, et al., 2002, Immunology, 105: 478-87).
Several lines of evidence suggest that IDO is involved in induction of immune tolerance. Studies of mammalian pregnancy, tumor resistance, chronic infections and autoimmune diseases have shown that cells expressing IDO can suppress T-cell responses and promote tolerance. Accelerated Trp catabolism has been observed in diseases and disorders associated with cellular immune activation, such as infection, malignancy, autoimmune diseases and AIDS, as well as during pregnancy. It was proposed that IDO is induced chronically by HIV infection, and is further increased by opportunistic infections, and that the chronic loss of Trp initiates mechanisms responsible for cachexia, dementia and diarrhea and possibly immunosuppression of AIDS patients (Brown, et al., 1991, Adv. Exp. Med. Biol., 294: 425-35). To this end, it has recently been shown that IDO inhibition can enhance the levels of virus-specific T cells and, concomitantly, reduce the number of virally infected macrophages in a mouse model of HIV (Portula et al., 2005, Blood, 106:2382-90).
IDO is believed to play a role in the immunosuppressive processes that prevent fetal rejection in utero. More than 40 years ago, it was observed that, during pregnancy, the genetically disparate mammalian conceptus survives in spite of what would be predicted by tissue transplantation immunology (Medawar, 1953, Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 7: 320-38). Anatomic separation of mother and fetus and antigenic immaturity of the fetus cannot fully explain fetal allograft survival. Recent attention has focused on immunologic tolerance of the mother. Because IDO is expressed by human syncytiotrophoblast cells and systemic tryptophan concentration falls during normal pregnancy, it was hypothesized that IDO expression at the maternal-fetal interface is necessary to prevent immunologic rejection of the fetal allografts. To test this hypothesis, pregnant mice (carrying syngeneic or allogeneic fetuses) were exposed to 1MT, and a rapid, T cell-induced rejection of all allogeneic concepti was observed. Thus, by catabolizing tryptophan, the mammalian conceptus appears to suppress T-cell activity and defends itself against rejection, and blocking tryptophan catabolism during murine pregnancy allows maternal T cells to provoke fetal allograft rejection (Munn, et al., 1998, Science 281: 1191-3).
Further evidence for a tumoral immune resistance mechanism based on tryptophan degradation by IDO comes from the observation that most human tumors constitutively express IDO, and that expression of IDO by immunogenic mouse tumor cells prevents their rejection by preimmunized mice. This effect is accompanied by a lack of accumulation of specific T cells at the tumor site and can be partly reverted by systemic treatment of mice with an inhibitor of IDO, in the absence of noticeable toxicity. Thus, it was suggested that the efficacy of therapeutic vaccination of cancer patients might be improved by concomitant administration of an IDO inhibitor (Uyttenhove et al., 2003, Nature Med., 9: 1269-74). It has also been shown that the IDO inhibitor, 1-MT, can synergize with chemotherapeutic agents to reduce tumor growth in mice, suggesting that IDO inhibition may also enhance the anti-tumor activity of conventional cytotoxic therapies (Muller et al., 2005, Nature Med., 11:312-9).
One mechanism contributing to immunologic unresponsiveness toward tumors may be presentation of tumor antigens by tolerogenic host APCs. A subset of human IDO-expressing antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that coexpressed CD123 (IL3RA) and CCR6 and inhibited T-cell proliferation have also been described. Both mature and immature CD123-positive dendritic cells suppressed T-cell activity, and this IDO suppressive activity was blocked by 1MT (Munn, et al., 2002, Science 297: 1867-70). It has also been demonstrated that mouse tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) contain a subset of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) that constitutively express immunosuppressive levels of IDO. Despite comprising only 0.5% of lymph node cells, in vitro, these pDCs potently suppressed T cell responses to antigens presented by the pDCs themselves and also, in a dominant fashion, suppressed T cell responses to third-party antigens presented by nonsuppressive APCs. Within the population of pDCs, the majority of the functional IDO-mediated suppressor activity segregated with a novel subset of pDCs coexpressing the B-lineage marker CD19. Thus, it was hypothesized that IDO-mediated suppression by pDCs in TDLNs creates a local microenvironment that is potently suppressive of host antitumor T cell responses (Munn, et al., 2004, J. Clin. Invest., 114(2): 280-90).
IDO degrades the indole moiety of tryptophan, serotonin and melatonin, and initiates the production of neuroactive and immunoregulatory metabolites, collectively known as kynurenines. By locally depleting tryptophan and increasing proapoptotic kynurenines, IDO expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) can greatly affect T-cell proliferation and survival. IDO induction in DCs could be a common mechanism of deletional tolerance driven by regulatory T cells. Because such tolerogenic responses can be expected to operate in a variety of physiopathological conditions, tryptophan metabolism and kynurenine production might represent a crucial interface between the immune and nervous systems (Grohmann, et al., 2003, Trends Immunol., 24: 242-8).
Small molecule inhibitors of IDO are being developed to treat or prevent IDO-related diseases such as those described above. For example, PCT Publication WO 99/29310 reports methods for altering T cell-mediated immunity comprising altering local extracellular concentrations of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites, using an inhibitor of IDO such as 1-methyl-DL-tryptophan, p-(3-benzofuranyl)-DL-alanine, p-[3-benzo(b)thienyl]-DL-alanine, and 6-nitro-L-tryptophan) (Munn, 1999). Reported in WO 03/087347, also published as European Patent 1501918, are methods of making antigen-presenting cells for enhancing or reducing T cell tolerance (Munn, 2003). Compounds having indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitory activity are further reported in WO 2004/094409; and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0234623 is directed to methods of treating a subject with a cancer or an infection by the administration of an inhibitor of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase in combination with other therapeutic modalities.
In light of the experimental data indicating a role for IDO in immunosuppression, tumor resistance and/or rejection, chronic infections, HIV-infection, AIDS (including its manifestations such as cachexia, dementia and diarrhea), autoimmune diseases or disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis), and immunologic tolerance and prevention of fetal rejection in utero, therapeutic agents aimed at suppression of tryptophan degradation by inhibiting IDO activity are desirable. Inhibitors of IDO can be used to activate T cells and therefore enhance T cell activation when the T cells are suppressed by pregnancy, malignancy or a virus such as HIV. Inhibition of IDO may also be an important treatment strategy for patients with neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or disorders such as depression. The compounds, compositions and methods herein help meet the current need for IDO modulators.

Definitions
Terms used herein may be preceded and/or followed by a single dash, “-”, or a double dash, “=”, to indicate the bond order of the bond between the named substituent and its parent moiety; a single dash indicates a single bond and a double dash indicates a double bond or a pair of single bonds in the case of a spiro-substituent. In the absence of a single or double dash it is understood that a single bond is formed between the substituent and its parent moiety; further, substituents are intended to be read “left to right” unless a dash indicates otherwise. For example, C1-C6alkoxycarbonyloxy and —OC(O)C1-C6alkyl indicate the same functionality; similarly arylalkyl, arylalkyl-, and -alkylaryl indicate the same functionality.
Further, certain terms herein may be used as both monovalent and divalent linking radicals as would be familiar to those skilled in the art, and by their presentation linking between two other moieties. For example, an alkyl group can be both a monovalent radical or divalent radical; in the latter case, it would be apparent to one skilled in the art that an additional hydrogen atom is removed from a monovalent alkyl radical to provide a suitable divalent moiety.
The term “alkenyl” as used herein, means a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon containing from 2 to 10 carbons, unless otherwise specified, and containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Representative examples of alkenyl include, but are not limited to, ethenyl, 2-propenyl, 2-methyl-2-propenyl, 3-butenyl, 4-pentenyl, 5-hexenyl, 2-heptenyl, 2-methyl-1-heptenyl, 3-decenyl, and 3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dienyl.
The term “alkoxy” as used herein, means an alkyl group, as defined herein, appended to the parent molecular moiety through an oxygen atom. Representative examples of alkoxy include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, 2-propoxy, butoxy, tert-butoxy, pentyloxy, and hexyloxy.

Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, for example, by a continuous perfusion pump. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable.
Also, pharmaceutical compositions can contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds described herein above in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the compositions described herein, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, for example, a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.
In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.
Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions described herein can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.
The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 100 mg, more usually about 10 to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient. The term “unit dosage forms” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.
The active compound can be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound described herein. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of a compound described herein.
The tablets or pills can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.
The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.
The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.
The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.
The therapeutic dosage of the compounds can vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound described herein in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds described herein can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 μg/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
The compounds described herein can also be formulated in combination with one or more additional active ingredients which can include any pharmaceutical agent such as anti-viral agents, vaccines, antibodies, immune enhancers, immune suppressants, anti-inflammatory agents and the like.
Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods
Another aspect relates to fluorescent dye, spin label, heavy metal or radio-labeled derivatives of the compounds described herein that would be useful not only in imaging but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating the IDO enzyme in tissue samples, including human, and for identifying IDO enzyme ligands by inhibition binding of a labeled compound. Accordingly, further provided are IDO enzyme assays that contain such labeled compounds.
Further provided are isotopically-labeled compounds of the compounds described herein. An “isotopically” or “radio-labeled” compound is a compound described herein where one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides that may be include but are not limited to 2H (also written as D for deuterium), 3H (also written as T for tritium), 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 18F, 35S, 36Cl, 82Br, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br, 123I 124I, 125I and 131I. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro IDO enzyme labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate 3H, 14C, 82Br, 125I, 131I, 35S or will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications 11C, 18F, 125I, 123I, 124I, 131I, 75Br, 76Br or 77Br will generally be most useful.
It is understood that a “radio-labeled” or “labeled compound” is a compound that has incorporated at least one radionuclide. In some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of 3H, 14C, 125I, 35S and 82Br.
Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are applicable to compounds described herein and are well known in the art.
A radio-labeled compound described herein can be used in a screening assay to identify/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the radio-labeled compound described herein to the IDO enzyme. Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the radio-labeled compound for binding to the IDO enzyme directly correlates to its binding affinity.
Kits
Also included are pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in the treatment or prevention of IDO-associated diseases or disorders, obesity, diabetes and other diseases referred to herein which include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein. Such kits can further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, for example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, can also be included in the kit.
The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the disclosure in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of noncritical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. The example compounds below were found to be inhibitors of IDO according to one or more of the assays described herein.
EXAMPLES
All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources. All commercial reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification. The reactions were monitored using analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) with 0.25 mm EM Science silica gel plates (60F-254).

A variety of methods used in this patent to synthesize intermediate A are outlined below in Scheme 1. Palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling of 4-iodo-1-trityl-1H-imidazole with phenylboronic acids gives rise to 2-(1-trityl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)benzaldehydes. The resulting 2-(1-trityl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)benzaldehydes are affected by aldol condensations or Homer-Wadsworth reactions to afford intermediate A. Alternatively, the synthesis of intermediate A can be achieved by allowing 2-iodobenzaldehydes to react with substituted methyl ketones in the presence of a base to afford 3-(2-iodophenyl)prop-2-en-1-ones. Negishi cross-coupling of the resulting 3-(2-iodophenyl)prop-2-en-1-ones with 4-iodo-1-trityl-1H-imidazole, also leads to intermediate A. Subjecting intermediate A to trityl deprotection conditions gives rise to 2-(5H-imidazo[5,1-a]isoindol-5-yl)ethanone B, which may be reduced to 2-(5H-imidazo[5,1-a]isoindol-5-yl)ethanol C (Scheme 2).

The resulting white suspension was allowed to stir for 90 min and a solution of methyl 2-bromo-3-fluorobenzoate (280 mg, 1.20 mmol) in THF (1 mL) was added followed by the immediate addition of Pd(PPh3)4 (58 mg, 0.05 mmol). The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at 90° C. for 18 h under an atmosphere of N2. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was diluted with CH2Cl2 (20 mL) and the organic layer was washed with an EDTA (aq) buffer (pH=9) (2×5 mL) and brine. The organic layer was dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude residue was purified by flash column chromatography to afford the desired product as yellow oil (190 mg, 41%). 1H NMR: 3.93 (s, 3H), 7.12-7.59 (m, 18H), 7.56 (s, 1H), 7.73-7.75 (m, 1H).

To a solution of methyl 3-fluoro-2-(1-trityl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)benzoate (62 mg, 0.134 mmol) in toluene (4 mL) at −78° C. was added dropwise a solution DIBAH (1 M, 0.161 mL, 0.161 mmol) Stirring was continued at for 10 min. At this temperature, dry methanol was added. The mixture was poured into saturated aqueous NH4Cl (5 mL), diluted with EtOAc (15 mL), shaken vigorously for 3 min, added brine (5 mL), shaken again, the phases separated and the organic layer dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated to give the desired aldehyde which was used without further purification.
Example 22 General Procedure for the Synthesis of Dimethyl (2-oxo)phosphonates
To a stirred solution of dimethyl methylphosphonate (3.14 g, 25.3 mmol) in 20 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at −78° C. was added dropwise a solution of n-butyl lithium (10.13 mL, 25.3 mmol, 2.5 M in hexanes) under an atmosphere of N2, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. To this reaction mixture was added dropwise a solution of the appropriate commercially available methyl or ethyl ester or 19-26, 91 or 115-121 (12.7 mmol) as a solution in THF (5 mL). After being stirred for 30 minutes, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 0° C., and stirred for 1 h. The solvent was distilled off and the crude was diluted with saturated NH4Cl (10 mL) and 10 ml of water. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (2×40 mL). The combined ethyl acetate layers were washed with water (1×20 mL), brine (1×20 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the crude product. The crude was purified by column chromatography to afford the following compounds.

The appropriate 2-(1-trityl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)benzaldehyde was added as a solution in THF (3 mL) drop wise over a period of 3 min. The reaction was allowed to warm to RT and stirred overnight. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude was diluted with saturated NH4Cl (10 mL) and water (10 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2×20 mL) and the combined organic fractions were washed with brine (15 mL), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the crude product. To the crude residue was added AcOH (1 mL) and MeOH (3 mL) and the solution was stirred at 90° C. for 2 h. After cooling to rt, the solvent was distilled off and the crude was stirred in a mixture of sat'd K2CO3 (5 mL) and EtOAc (5 mL). The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2×10 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water, brine and dried (Na2SO4) and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel to afford the following compounds.

Biological Example 1 Human IDO Protein Cloning, Expression and Purification
Expression vectors for human indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) protein were prepared by amplification of a 1219 bp fragment of the sequence present in vector phIDO6His cDNA with primers 5′-ggagcatgctaATGGCACACGCTATGGAAAAC-3′ and 5′-gagagatctACCTTCCTTCAAAAGGGATTTC-3′ and cloning the SphI-BglII 1213 bp fragment into pQE70 (Qiagen), to yield vector pQE70-hIDO. This construct adds 2 extra amino acids and a 6-Histidine tag to the C-terminus of the natural human IDO protein while preserving intact the natural start codon and N-terminus amino acid sequence. The amplified allele of human IDO shows two polymorphisms with respect to the sequence deposited in accession file P14902 of SwissProt database. These polymorphisms result in a P110S and E119G amino acid changes.
Plasmid pQE70-hIDO was transformed into M15(pREP4) cells (Qiagen) and clones were selected in LB-agar plates supplemented with carbenicillin 50 μg/mL and kanamycin 30 μg/mL. Protein expression was carried out by growing an overnight culture of the M15pREP4/pQE70-hIDO clone in 100 mL LB supplemented with 100 rμg/mL carbenicillin, 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 50 μg/mL of L-tryptophan (LBCKT medium). 40 mL of this culture were inoculated into 750 mL of LBCKT for 4 hours at 37° C. This culture was diluted 1:10 into LBCKT medium and cultured for another 2 hours at 37° C. until OD600 was higher than 0.8. At this point the cultures were inoculated with Hemin to 7 μM and L-Tryptophan to 75 μg/mL and incubated at 37° C. for 2 h. Induction of protein expression was carried out by supplementing the cultures with IPTG to 1 mM, PMSF to 200 μM, EDTA to 1 mM and L-tryptophan to 50 μg/mL. Incubation was continued for additional 16 h at 25° C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were washed with PBS buffer supplemented with 200 μM PMSF and 1 mM EDTA and stored at −80° C. until protein purification.
The equivalent of 16 L of culture were processed in one batch of purification. Cell pellets were thawed, resuspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 200 μM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mg/mL lysozyme to 10 mL per liter of bacterial culture and incubated 30 minutes on ice. Cells were then lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged 20 min at 20000 g and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 μm filters. The filtered supernatant was loaded onto a 60 mL phosphocellulose column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 (KPB) at 1-3 mL/min. The column was washed with 3 volumes of 50 mM KPB, 3 volumes of 100 mM KPB and the protein was eluted with 15 volumes of a linear gradient of 100-500 mM KPB. Fractions were collected and IDO activity assay was performed by measuring kynurenine production. This was carried out by mixing 50 μL of each fraction with 100 μL of reaction mix to yield a final concentration of 50 mM KPB buffer, 20 mM ascorbic acid, 200 μg/mL catalase, 20 μM methylene blue and 400 μM L-tryptophan. Fractions demonstrating IDO activity were loaded onto a Ni-NTA purification column (15 mL). This affinity purification column was washed with 10 volumes of 250 mM KPB, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole pH 8, and eluted with 10 volumes of buffer containing 250 mM KPB, 150 mM NaCl and a 50 to 250 mM imidazole linear gradient. Collected fractions were assayed by IDO enzymatic assay described above and the positive fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against a buffer containing 250 mM KPB, 50% glycerol. This process yields ˜8-10 mg of pure protein (>98%) with a specific activity of 170 μmol/h/mg.
Biological Example 2 Testing of IDO Inhibitory Compounds by Enzymatic IDO Assay
The IC50 values for each compound were determined by testing the activity of IDO in a mixture containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5; 70 nM purified human IDO protein, 200 μM L-tryptophan, 20 mM ascorbate, 20 μM methylene blue, 0.1% DMSO. The inhibitors were initially diluted in DMSO at 100 mM and were diluted in potassium phosphate 50 mM, added to the reaction mixture at final concentrations raging from 1 mM to 5 nM and preincubated with the enzyme for 5 min at 25° C. The reaction was started by addition of L-tryptophan to 200 μM and incubated 15 min at 37° C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 vol of 30% trichloroacetic acid and incubated 30 min at 60° C. to hydrolyze N-formylkynurenine to kynurenine. The reaction was centrifuged at 3400 g for 5 min to remove precipitated protein and the supernatant was reacted with 2% (w/v) of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in acetic acid. The reaction was incubated 10 min at 25° C. and read at 480 nm in a spectrophotometer. Control samples with no IDO inhibitor, or with no IDO enzyme or with the reference inhibitors 1-methyl-tryptophan (200 μM) and menadione (1.2 μM) were used as controls to set the parameters for the non-linear regressions necessary for determination of the IC50 for each compound. Nonlinear regressions and determination of the IC50 values were performed using the GraphPad Prism 4 software. Compounds with an IC50 of less than 500 μM were considered as active inhibitors in this assay.
Biological Example 3 Determination of IDO Inhibitory Activity and Toxicity in Cell Based IDO/Kynurenine Assay
293-T-REx™ cells (Invitrogen) constitutively express a tet operator binding repressor protein and are maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS, 1× Penicillin+Streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 μg/mL blasticidin at 37° C. with a 5% CO2 in air atmosphere and typically split prior to confluency. Cells were passed by splitting the culture 1/10-by removing media by aspiration, washing 1× with PBS, incubating with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA until the cells detach, disbursing the cells in fresh growth media, and plating at 1/10 dilutions in fresh growth media. For long term cryopreservation, cells are detached from the plate as described above, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in freeze medium (growth medium, 10% DMSO), stored in 1.8 mL cyropreservation vials (˜2-5×106 cells per vial), in liquid nitrogen vapor storage tanks.
IDO1-expressing 293-T-Rex™ cell lines were generated by stable transfection of plasmid pcDNA-tetO-IDO expressing human IDO or murine IDO under the control of the doxycycline-inducible CMV-tet promoter. Transfected cells were selected in DBZ medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1× Penicillin+Streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 μg/mL blasticidin and 25 μg/mL Zeocin) at 37° C. with a 5% CO2 in air atmosphere. Individual clones were isolated by limiting dilution cloning from these populations. These clones were assayed for IDO activity and the clones that showed the highest levels of IDO activity inducible by doxycycline were used for subsequent cell based IDO assays.
To setup an IDO cell based activity assay, IDO-293-T-Rex cells were harvested and resuspended in DBZ media at 106 cells/mL, and split into poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates at 100,000 cells per well. 100 μL of Neutral medium (DBZ medium, 200 μM L-tryptophan) or Induction media (Neutral medium supplemented with 5 μM doxycycline) are added to the cells and incubated 28 h at 37° C. After the IDO induction period, medium is removed and replaced with Induction or Neutral medium containing different concentrations of each inhibitor (1 mM to 0.5 nM). The cells incubated in Neutral medium serve as negative control of the assay. The cells incubated in Induction medium and without inhibitor serve as the positive control of the assay. The incubation is carried out for 16 h at 37° C. in a cell culture incubator. 200 μL of medium are transferred to U-bottom polypropylene 96-well plates containing 25 μL of 30% TCA, incubated 30 minutes at 60° C. and centrifuged at 3400 g for 5 minutes. 150 μL of the clear supernatant is transferred to a polystyrene 96-well plate containing 50 μL of 4% (w/v) of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in acetic acid, incubated for 10 min. Kynurenine concentration is determined by measuring the absorbance at 480 nm.
To measure the toxicity of each compound after 16 h incubation with cells, cell viability is measured via a WST-1 assay (Roche) according to instructions from the manufacturer. Briefly, after the incubation with each compound, medium is aspirated and replaced with 100 mL of WST-1 reagent, and incubated 30 min at 37° C. Absorbance at 540 nm is correlated with the number of viable cells. Determination of IC50 (Kynurenine assay) or LD50 (WST-1 assay) is performed via non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software.
Biological Example 4 Reversal of IDO-Mediated Suppression of T-Cell Proliferation by IDO Inhibitors
Human monocytes were collected from peripheral mononuclear cells by leukoapheresis and cultured overnight at 106 cells/well in a 96-well plate in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. Adherent cells were retained and cultured for 7 days with 200 ng/ml IL-4, 100 ng/ml GM-CSF. Cells were matured for 2 days with a cytokine cocktail containing TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and PGE2 for additional 2 days to induce dendritic cell maturation. At the end of maturation, loosely adherent cells were detached by gentle aspiration and plated in V-bottom 96 well plates, at 5000 cells/well. These cells are >80% IDO+ dendritic cells. Human allogeneic T cells (3×105) from normal donors were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100-200 U/mL IL-2 and 100 ng/mL anti-CD3 antibody and added to the wells. Serial dilutions of IDO compounds dissolved in phenol red-free RPMI was added to yield a final concentration of IDOi between 500 and 1 μM. After incubation for 2-4 days, T cell proliferation was measured by BrdU incorporation assay after an overnight pulse with BrdU labeling mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). At the en of the pulse, the cells were fixed and incubated with 100 μL/well anti-BrdU-POD antibody following the instructions from the manufacturer. Plates were read in a microplate reader.
Alternatively, testing of IDO inhibitors in an in vitro mouse model of IDO-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation is performed by the following procedure. C57bl6 mice are inoculated with 1×106 B78H1-GMCSF tumor cells in the right flank. After 10-12 days, tumor draining lymph nodes are collected and cells are stained with anti-CD11c and anti-B220 monoclonal antibodies. Cells are sorted by high-speed fluorescence activated cell sorting and the CD11c+/B220+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells are collected and seeded at 2000 cells/well in 96 well V-bottom plates. Splenocytes are collected from BM3 transgenic mice (in CBA background) and collected by nylon wool enrichment. BM3 T cells (105 cells/well) are added to each well in 200 μL of RPMI, 10% FCS, 50 μM β-mercaptoetanol. Alternatively, T cells are obtained from spleens of OT-I transgenic mice and added to the culture in combination with OVA peptide. IDO inhibitors are added dissolved in RPMI at final concentrations ranging from 1 mM to 10 nM. After 3 days of stimulation, cells are pulsed by 16 h with BrdU or 3H-thymidine. Cells are collected, fixed and tested for BrdU incorporation following the instructions from the BrdU labeling kit manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). If 3H-tymidine is used to measure T cell proliferation, cells are harvested and dpm counts are measured in a scintillation counter following procedures widely known in the art. Control CD11c+ cells taken from the contralateral lymph node or CD11c+/B220− cells (IDO− population) from the TDLN are used as positive control for proliferation.

Biological Example 6 In Vivo Testing of IDO Inhibitors for Antitumor Activity in Combination with Chemotherapeutic Agents
In vivo anti-tumor efficacy can be tested using modified tumor allograft protocols. For instance, it has been described in the literature that IDO inhibition can syngerize with cytotoxic chemotherapy in immune-competent mice. Due to different susceptibilities of different tumor cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs and to immune mediated rejection, each IDO inhibitor is tested alone and in combination with 2 different chemotherapeutic drugs in 4 different animal tumor models, represented by 4 different mouse tumor cell lines, of different tissue origin (colorectal, bladder, mammary and lung carcinoma), implanted subcutaneously in syngeneic strains of mice. These cell lines have been selected based on their known susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drugs, their partial response to IDO inhibitors as single agents, their presumed pattern of IDO expression according to their tissue of origin, and their ability to elicit an immune reaction.
For every animal tumor model, 2 different chemotherapeutic drugs are tested in separate groups of mice according to the following list: 1] LLC tumor: cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel; 2] EMT6 tumor: cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel; 3] CT26 tumor: cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin; and 4] MB49 tumor: cyclophosphamide and gemcitabine.
The following chemotherapeutic drugs are used, at the indicated doses. The maximum tolerated dose for the following chemotherapeutic agents in mice depends on the formulation, concentration, frequency of administration, route of administration and number of doses. The chemotherapeutic drugs administered in conjunction with each IDO inhibitor drug are: 1] Paclitaxel: 20 mg/kg/day i.p, every 4 days, 4 times (q4dx4) (in Cremophor); 2] Doxorubicin: 5 mg/kg, once a week for 3 weeks (q7dx3); 3] Cyclophosphamide (CTX): 100 mg/kg, I.P., every 4 days, 4 times (q4dx4); 4] Gemcitabine: 80 mg/kg every 4 days, 4 times, i.p. (q4dx4).
All animals receive a subcutaneous injection of a tumor forming dose of live tumor cells (˜50000-1000000 cells) suspended in 0.1 mL of PBS or saline on day 1. Subcutaneous injection forms a localized tumor that allows monitoring tumor growth over time.
To mimic the effect of IDO inhibitor drugs as therapeutic compositions, administration of IDO inhibitor drugs begins at day 5-8 after tumor inoculation. Dosing, route of administration, dosing frequency varies depending on the toxicity and pharmacokinetics profile of each drug. Duration of the treatment is 2 weeks. Most preferably, drug is administered continuously via oral gavage or dissolution in the drinking water. Alternatively, subcutaneous slow release pellets or osmotic pumps containing 100 mg of each drug are implanted under the skin by surgical procedure. IDO inhibitor drug are administered at the maximum tolerated dose or at a concentration corresponding to the LD50.
An example of antitumor activity is shown in FIGS. 1-2 (for Cpd#1357) and FIGS. 3-4 (for Cpd#1304). In this test, 200000 LLC murine tumor cells were injected subcutaneously into syngeneic C57Bl6 mice on day 0. Each treatement group consists of 10 mice. On day 7, once the tumor is established and IDO expression is induced in plasmacytoid dendritic cells at the tumor draining lymph nodes, a group of 10 mice were surgically implanted (subcutaneously and on the opposite flank to the tumor), with osmotic pumps loaded with 200 uL of a 30 mg/mL solution of compounds 1357 or 1304 in cremaphor:EtOH:saline (10:10:80). These pumps release 1 uL of solution per hour for a period of 8 days, achieveing a steady state plasma concentration of drug of ˜0.5-3 micromolar. From days 15 to 24 compound administrations continued via two s.c. daily doses of 1 mg each. In the case of FIGS. 3-4 , mice were optionally treated with cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection on days 9, 13 and 15 post-tumor innoculation, either as a single agent or in combination with compound 1304. The results of these tests indicate that compounds 1357 and 1304 have a significant antitumor effect either as a single agent or when administered in combination with chemotherapy. The therapeutic effect is observed as a reduced rate of tumor growth, which has an impact on median survival time and in overall survival fraction. FIG. 1 shows the average tumor volume over time of two groups of 10 mice each. The control group was treated with vehicle, while the treatment groups received osmotic pumps with compound 1357 as described above. The tumor volumes were fitted to an exponential growth equation and the fitted parameters were compared using GraphPad software. The data indicate a statistically significant differences between the two curves (p<0.0001). FIG. 2 shows the survival plot of the same groups of mice described in FIG. 1 . The log rank test indicates a statistically significant difference in median survival time when animals were treated with compound 1357 as a single agent. FIG. 3 shows the average tumor volume over time of four groups of 10 mice each. The control group was treated with vehicle, while the treatment groups received either cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, osmotic pumps with compound 1304, or a combination therapy of cyclophosphamide with compound 1304. The data shows that this tumor is very sensitive to the effects of treatment with compound 1304 either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. FIG. 4 shows the survival plot of the same groups of mice described in FIG. 3 . The log rank test indicated a statistically significant difference in median survival time when animals were treated with compound 1304, either as a single agent or in combination with cyclophosphamide. The long term survival fraction observed for treatment with 1304 is exceptionally high, with 70-80% of the mice being tumor free after 60 days.
