This application is a § 371 application from PCT/FR2015/051332 filed May 20, 2015, which claims priority from French Patent Application No. 14 54538 filed May 20, 2014, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to chemical compounds and to the therapeutic use thereof, in particular for improving muscle quality in mammals.
More particularly, the invention makes it possible to improve muscle quality in obese mammals.
The invention also makes it possible to improve the muscle quality of sarcopenic mammals.
The invention also relates to the use of these chemical compounds in the treatment and/or prevention of obesity in mammals.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Muscle atrophy can result from several different causes: undernutrition, non-use of the muscles (for example immobilization following a fracture), cancer or other serious disease (heart or kidney failure) inducing cachexia, or resulting naturally from the aging of individuals (sarcopenia). This atrophy can result from a reduction in protein synthesis and/or from an increase in proteolysis and, as appropriate, is accompanied by fibrosis and/or by infiltration by adipose tissue. The identification of the factors and mechanisms controlling muscle protein synthesis and muscle proteolysis thus represents a prerequisite for designing appropriate treatments for these pathological conditions. FIG. 1 , which is part of the prior art, shows the principal pathways of protein synthesis and proteolysis in muscles (reconstructed according to Zhao et al., 2008 and Little et al., 2009).
Muscle protein synthesis is essential, and is essentially controlled at the translational level. It requires of course an adequate nutritional intake of amino acids. It is stimulated by physical activity and regulated by numerous factors, at the forefront of which are IGF-1 and androgens (Little et al., 2009).  TABLE 1

Myofibril proteolysis is performed via the proteasome, while the mitochondria are destroyed by autophagy (Zhao et al., 2008). Satellite cell apoptosis mechanisms are also described (Murphy et al., 2010).
Myostatin, produced in an autocrine manner by the muscles themselves, represents a particularly important factor, since it acts both by stimulating proteolysis and by inhibiting protein synthesis. It also stimulates fibrosis (Li et al., 2008).
Aging is accompanied by a modification of the various regulatory factors (Walston et al., 2012): physical activity is often reduced, protein/vitamin nutrition may be insufficient and, following meals, the contents of circulating amino acids, an increase of which is required to stimulate protein synthesis, show a reduced increase that may be due to splanchnic sequestration (Boirie et al., 1997). Moreover, aging is accompanied by considerable hormonal modifications: an increase in myostatin (Leger et al., 2008), a reduction in androgens (Seidman, 2007) and in growth hormone (Macell et al., 2001; Sattler, 2013), and also an increase in inflammation markers (IL-6, TNF-α etc., Schaap et al., 2009; Verghese et al., 2011), will in particular be noted. These various modifications are unfavorable for protein synthesis, whereas these promote proteolysis, hence the gradual reduction in muscle size (sarcopenia). They also cause a modification in the distribution of muscle fiber types to the detriment of the fast fibers, which is reflected by a decrease in muscle strength (dynapenia). Finally, the development of connective tissue within the muscles (fibrosis) is witnessed.
In an obesity context, the situation is worsened for several additional reasons: fat infiltration of the muscles worsens the inflammatory context, insulin resistance reduces the effect of IGF-1 on protein synthesis, without considering that mobility is reduced by the excess weight (Stenholm et al., 2009). FIG. 2 , which is part of the prior art, illustrates the worsening of sarcopenia in an obesity context (according to Quillot et al., 2013).
In any event, in the absence of treatment, sarcopenia is a process which can only get worse, until total loss of mobility. However, sarcopenia is not the only process which results in skeletal muscle atrophy. Atrophy also occurs during immobilization (for example following a fracture), during prolonged fasting (or a slimming diet), or during serious pathological conditions (for example cancers, AIDS) which cause cachexia. Mention may also be made of various muscle dystrophies of genetic origin. These various situations have a certain number of characteristics in common with sarcopenia, but with a respective weight different than the triggering factors (Tisdale, 2007; Saini et al., 2009).
Known Possible Treatments
Various methods for preventing/treating sarcopenia have thus been envisaged and tested. They are first and foremost physical exercise, the effectiveness of which is established (Bonnefoy et al, 2000; Bonnefoy, 2008; Ryan et al., 2013). Thus, following exercise carried out over a period of 8 weeks, increases in muscle strength of 180% and in muscle mass of 11% have been observed (Fiatarone et al., 1990). However, optimal effectiveness would require several hours of physical exercise per day, which is difficult to envision over long periods of time.
An increased intake of protein synthesis substrates, whether by giving rapidly digestive proteins according to an optimized timing (Coëffier et al., 2009; Aussel et al., 2013), and also a supplement of certain amino acids or their metabolites (leucine, HMB [β-hydroxy-ρ-methylbutyrate], citrulline, ornithine), can increase muscle protein synthesis (Li & Heber, 2011).
Various pharmaceutical treatments aim to correct the modifications of the hormonal context associated with aging (Crenn, 2013). They comprise:
sex hormones such as testosterone (White et al., 2013) or variants thereof, SARMs (Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators), or non-sex hormones such as growth hormone (Liu et al., 2003) and IGF-1, ghrelin or progranulin, or even vitamin D;
myostatin inhibitors (antibodies directed against the molecule or its receptor, or myostatin precursor peptide) (Murphy et al., 2010; Han & Mitch, 2011);
molecules which target the renin-angiotensin system, such as inhibitors of ACE or angiotensin 1-7 (Dalla Libera et al., 2001; Shiuchi et al., 2004; Kalupahana & Moustaid-Moussa, 2012; Allen et al., 2013);
β-adrenergic receptor agonists (Ryall et al., 2004, 2007);
varied natural substances, or even more complex extracts of plant origin (for example, isoflavones: Aubertin-Leheudre et al., 2007; olive oil extract: Pierno et al., 2014; resveratrol: Shadfar et al., 2011; Bennett et al., 2013).
The great diversity of these treatments attests to the difficulty of treating a multifactorial pathological condition, the triggering factors of which have not been totally identified. Furthermore, several candidate molecules have side effects (in the case of sex hormones, SARMs or β-agonists, for example), or have as yet been studied only on animal models. All these elements explain the lack of available medicaments on the market.
To date, research studies target more particularly myostatin, by inhibiting its action with, for example, anti-myostatin antibodies or anti-receptor antibodies (Dumonceaux et al., 2010; Greenberg, 2012; Sakuma & Yamaguchi, 2012; Arounleut et al., 2013; Buehring & Binkley, 2013; Collins-Hooper et al., 2014; White & Le Brasseur, 2014).
Phytoecdysones, and more particularly the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), have been the subject of numerous pharmacological studies, which began in Japan and then in Uzbekistan, and have subsequently developed in various other countries.
These studies have revealed the antidiabetic and anabolic properties of this molecule. Its stimulating effects on protein syntheses in muscles are observed in rats in vivo (Syrov, 2000; Tóth et al., 2008; Lawrence, 2012) and on C2C12 murine myotubes in vitro (Gorelick-Feldman et al., 2008). It is an effect at the level of translation, which involves the phosphorylation of the p70S6K ribosomal protein, at the end of a cascade involving the Akt/PkB protein kinase, a pathway also used by IGF-1 to stimulate protein synthesis.
Using the same C2C12 cells, Zubeldia et al. (2012) have moreover shown that an Ajuga turkestanica extract enriched with phytoecdysones (20-hydroxyecdysone and turkesterone) inhibits the transcription of myostatin and of caspase 3 (a protein involved in apoptosis processes).
Moreover, 20-hydroxyecdysone has antifibrotic properties, which have not been demonstrated on muscles, but in the kidneys, where the fibrosis mechanisms take place very similarly (Hung et al., 2012). It thus opposes the effects of TGFβ, a protein similar to myostatin, and in particular the stimulation of Smad 2,3 caused by this substance. It can thus be considered that 20-hydroxyecdysone could have similar effects on muscles (or the heart).
20-Hydroxyecdysone reduces body fat in mice fed with a fat-enriched diet (Kizelsztein et al., 2009; Foucault et al., 2012) or in ovariectomized female rats, a model of menopause (Seidlova-Wuttke et al., 2010).
Some of the effects described above in animal models have been found in clinical studies, which are even fewer in number. Thus, 20-hydroxyecdysone increases physical capacity (Azizov et al., 1995; Gadhzieva et al., 1995) and muscle mass (Simakin et al., 1988) and causes a loss of abdominal fat mass in obese and overweight volunteers (Wuttke et al., 2013; Foucault et al., 2014; PCT patent application WO 2013/068704).
However, 20E and the metabolites thereof have poor bioavailability in mice (Dzhukharova et al., 1987; Hikino et al., 1972), in rats (Kapur et al., 2010 and Seidlova-Wuttke et al., 2010) and in humans (Brandt 2003; Bolduc, 2006). Their overall performance is among other things not entirely satisfactory in relation to muscle quality improvement applications.
Several studies have shown that turkesterone (11α,20-dihydroxyecdysone), a metabolite derived from 20E, shows a greater activity than that of 20E in vivo (Syrov et al., 2001: Bathori et al., 2008). There is still today, for therapeutic applications targeting an improvement in muscle quality both in obese mammals and in sarcopenic mammals, a need for novel compounds which have good bioavailability, expressed more particularly in terms of high plasma exposure coefficient, while at the same time having an overall activity greater than that of 20E on muscle quality improvement, this overall activity being expressed in terms of performance relating to inhibition of myostatin gene expression combined with increased protein synthesis in the mammal.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The inventors have now discovered that, entirely unexpectedly, certain compounds of the steroid family corresponding to a particular general formula, the structure of which differs from that of 20E and metabolites thereof, have a plasma exposure coefficient that is higher than that of said 20E and effects that are greater than or equal to those of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) with respect to the inhibition of myostatin and the stimulation of protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the S6K1 protein. These effects make it possible to improve the muscle quality and/or strength in sarcopenic mammals and sarcopenic obese mammals.
The compounds of the invention do not interact with steroid nuclear receptors of the sex sphere (androgen receptors and estrogen receptors). They show good chemical stability in plasma and in microsomes. Finally, several of them have a pharmacokinetic profile that is much improved compared with 20-hydroxyecdysone. They also induce better inhibition of myostatin gene expression and a better improvement of protein synthesis.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The object of the invention is to develop novel chemical compounds which meet in particular the objectives set above, in relation to therapeutic applications for the treatment and/or prevention of obesity and/or of sarcopenia in mammals. The latter compounds are novel since they do not exist in the chemical databases. They can advantageously be synthesized according to industrializable processes, that is to say processes with a minimum number of synthesis steps and an optimal yield. They have effects greater than those of 20E in terms of the inhibition of myostatin and the stimulation of protein synthesis via the phosphorylation of the S6K1 protein. They show good chemical stability in plasma and in microsomes. They have an improved pharmacokinetic profile and a defined dosage regimen. They stimulate muscle anabolism in C2C12 cells and show an anti-hyperglycemic effect.
In the context of the present invention, the term “aryl group” is intended to mean an aromatic ring having 5 to 8 carbon atoms or several fused aromatic rings having 5 to 14 carbon atoms. In particular, the aryl groups can be monocyclic or bicyclic groups, preferably phenyl or naphthyl. Advantageously, it is a phenyl group (Ph).
In the context of the present invention, the term “heteroaryl group” is intended to mean any hydrocarbon-based aromatic group of 3 to 9 atoms containing one or more heteroatoms, such as for example sulfur, nitrogen or oxygen atoms. The heteroaryl according to the present invention may consist of one or more fused rings. Examples of a heteroaryl group are furyl, isoxazyl, pyridyl, thiazolyl, pyrimidyl, benzimidazol, benzoxazole and benzothiazole groups. Advantageously, the heteroaryl group is chosen from furyl, pyridyl and thiazolyl groups. Advantageously, it is the furyl group.
In the context of the present invention, the term “halogen atom” is intended to mean any halogen atom, advantageously chosen from Cl, Br, I or F, in particular chosen from F, Cl or Br, in particular F or Cl.
In the context of the present invention, the term “C1-C6 alkyl group” is intended to mean any linear or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, in particular methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl or n-hexyl groups. Advantageously, it is a methyl, ethyl, isopropyl or t-butyl group, in particular a methyl or ethyl group, more particularly a methyl group.
In the context of the present invention, the term “C3-C6 cycloalkyl group” is intended to mean any saturated and hydrocarbon-based ring comprising from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, in particular the cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl group. Advantageously, it is a cyclopropyl or cyclohexyl group.
In the context of the present invention, the term “(C1-C6 alkyl group) aryl” is intended to mean any aryl group as defined above, bonded by means of a C1-C6 alkyl group as defined above. In particular, an example of a (C1-C6 alkyl group) aryl is a benzyl or —(CH2)2 phenyl group.
In the context of the present invention, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” is intended to mean what is of use in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition which is generally safe, nontoxic and neither biologically undesirable or undesirable in another way, and which is acceptable for both veterinary use and human pharmaceutical use.
In the context of the present invention, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts of a compound” is intended to mean salts which are pharmaceutically acceptable, as defined herein, and which have the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound. Such salts comprise:
(1) the acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, citric acid, ethanesulfonic acid, fumaric acid, glucoheptonic acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, glycolic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, muconic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, propionoic acid, salicylic acid, succinic acid, dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid, tartaric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trimethylacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid and the like; or
(2) the salts formed when an acid proton present in the parent compound is either replaced with a metal ion, for example an alkali metal ion, an alkaline-earth metal ion or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic or inorganic base. The acceptable organic bases comprise diethanolamine, ethanolamine, N-methylglucamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine and the like. The acceptable inorganic bases comprise aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide.
In the context of the present invention, the term “solvate of a compound” is intended to mean any compound obtained by addition of an inert solvent molecule to the compound according to the invention, the solvate forming because of their mutual attraction force. The solvates are, for example, alkoxides of the compound. A hydrate is a solvate in which the inert solvent used is water. It may be mono-, di- or trihydrated.
In the context of the present invention, the term “tautomer” is intended to mean any constitutional isomer of the compounds according to the present invention which are interconvertible by means of the reversible chemical reaction known as tautomerization. In most cases, the reaction occurs by migration of a hydrogen atom accompanied by a change in location of a double bond. In a solution of a compound capable of tautomerization, an equilibrium between the two tautomers is created. The ratio between tautomers then depends on the solvent, on the temperature and on the pH. Tautomerism is thus the conversion of one functional group into another, usually by concomitant shift of a hydrogen atom and of a π bond (double or triple bond). Common tautomers are, for example, the following pairs: aldehydes/ketones-alcohols or more specifically enol; amides-imidic acids; lactams-lactims; imines-enamines; enamines-enamines. In particular, it may include a ring-chain tautomerism which takes place when the movement of the proton is accompanied by the conversion of an open structure to a ring.
Description of the General Syntheses and Schemes
The compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared by applying or adapting any method known per se to those skilled in the art and/or within the scope of the latter, in particular those described by Larock (1989), or by applying or adapting the processes described in the procedures which follow.
The various groups refer to the definitions given above.
EXAMPLES
Materials and Methods
The proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra are performed on a Bruker Avance DPX300 apparatus (300.16 MHz). The chemical shifts (6) are measured in parts per million (ppm). The spectra are calibrated on the chemical shift of the deuterated solvent used. The coupling constants (J) are expressed in Hertz (Hz) and the multiplicity is represented in the following way: singulet (s), doublet (d), doublet of doublets (dd), triplet (t), triplet of doublets (td), quadruplet (q), multiplet (m). The mass spectra (MS) are carried out by an Agilent Technologies MSD, type G1946A, spectrometer, and the samples are ionized by an “atmospheric pressure chemical ionization” (APCI) source.

Cascade for Screening and Characterization of the Biological Effects of the 20-Hydroxyecdysone Derivatives
The development of the screening test was initiated on the basis of the studies in the literature and was based on the characteristics of the pathology of sarcopenia. At the physiopathological level, this disease is characterized by a decrease in protein synthesis and an increase in proteolysis. The development of future medicaments should thus be screened on molecular factors in relation to these two phenomena.
At the cellular level, on cultures of muscle cells derived from the C2C12 murine line, Gorelick-Feldman et al. (2008) showed that treatment with phytoecdysones increases protein synthesis by +20% on average. The first development studies were based on the culture and treatment conditions described by Gorelick-Feldman in the presence of reference products (IGF-1 and 20-hydroxyecdysone or 20E). Measurements of tritiated leucine incorporation into these cells were carried out in order to evaluate the de novo protein synthesis. These first results made it possible to determine that the optimal sequence for observing the effects of phytoecdysones on protein synthesis was to differentiate the cells for 5 days, then to add the tritiated leucine for 2 h 30 in the presence of IGF-1 or of 20E.
The analysis of the literature showed that molecules such as IGF-1 increased protein synthesis only by 20%, while at the same time activating targets of this signaling pathway in a more sustained manner that could reach stimulations of about 200% [Kazi et al., 2010]. These targets comprise phosphorylations that activate proteins such as Akt or S6 kinase. Furthermore, in the same C2C12 cell system, Zubeldia et al. (2012) analyzed the phenomena of apoptosis and proteolysis. In their study, they in particular reported that plant extracts containing phytoecdysones such as turkesterone or 20E were capable, after 24 h of treatment of differentiated C2C12 cells, of inhibiting myostatin and caspase 3 gene expression by a factor of 4 and 2, respectively [Zubeldia et al., 2012].
After several experiments in which the C2C12 cells differentiated into myotubes were incubated in the presence of IGF-1 or 20E for 2 h 30 or 6 h, two screening tests were developed. Thus, the phosphorylation of the S6 protein kinase and the expression of the myostatin gene were studied in order to determine their modulation by a growth hormone or an ecdysone and to characterize these modulations from a statistical point of view.
Protocols
Inhibition of Myostatin Expression in C2C12 Cells:
The C2C12 myoblast cells (ATCC CRL-1772) are seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 30 000 cells per well and cultured in a DMEM medium containing glucose in a proportion of 4.5 g/l and supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) and with antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Forty-eight hours later, the myoblasts are induced to differentiate by partial serum depletion (2% instead of 10%) for 5 days. The cells are then placed in a medium which is glucose-depleted (DMEM containing 1 g/l of glucose) and serum-free in the presence of the test molecules or of the references (100 ng/ml IGF-1 or 10 μM 20E) for 6 h. At the end of the experiment, the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are extracted using the conventional methodology based on phenol and chloroform. Briefly, the cells are lysed in a Trizol solution (Sigma T9424) containing a strong acid and phenol. The mRNAs are separated from the proteins by addition of chloroform and then centrifugation. They are then precipitated from isopropanol and then suspended at a concentration of 1 μg/μl in an RNAses-free and DNAses-free ultrapure water. 1 μg of mRNA is then converted by reverse transcription into complementary DNA by the AMV enzyme in the presence of a primer and of a mixture of nucleotides according to the protocol given by the supplier (Applied Biosystems 4368814). The gene expression is studied by chain reaction initiated by a polymerase enzyme and commonly referred to as PCR under quantitative conditions, hence the specific name qPCR. The qPCRs are carried out on a 7900HT Fast real-Time PCR detection system (Applied Biosystems). The programming conditions are standard and consist of 1 cycle at 95° C. for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95° C. for 15 s and at 60° C. for 1 min and the program ends with a melt curve step between 60° C. and 95° C. The samples analyzed all contain 100 ng of cDNA, a qPCR buffer including the enzyme, the mixture of oligonucleotides and the intercalating agent (sybergreen or SYBRgreen), and the pair of primers specific for the gene studied, strategically chosen between two exon sequences and at a final concentration of 200 nM. Fluorescent probes bind to the double-stranded DNA and are fluorescent only once bound to the DNA. A fluorescence threshold is established by the machine's program. When the amount of DNA allows the fluorescent probe to exceed this threshold, a PCR cycle number, called “Ct” for “Cycle Threshold”, is obtained. It is this value which forms the basis of the calculations to quantify the DNA relatively. A ratio R is established between the amount of starting DNA of a sample and that of a control, which has not undergone treatment (i.e. R=2−(Ct sample−Ct control)) and this measurement will be related to that of a housekeeping gene known not to be modulated by the treatment (i.e. R=2−ΔΔCt).

Phosphorylation of the S6 Kinase:
The C2C12 myoblast cells (ATCC CRL-1772) are seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 170 000 cells per well and cultured in a DMEM medium containing glucose in a proportion of 4.5 g/I and supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) and with antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Forty-eight hours later, the myoblasts are induced to differentiate by partial serum depletion (2% instead of 10%) for 5 days. The cells are then placed in a medium which is glucose-depleted (DMEM containing 1 g/l of glucose) and serum-free in the presence of the test molecules or of the references (100 ng/ml IGF-1 or 10 μM 20E) for 2 h. At the end of the experiment, the cells are lysed in a commercial lysis buffer (Invitrogen FNN0011) supplemented with a commercial mixture of anti-proteases (Roche 05056489001). After centrifugation, the cytoplasmic fraction containing the soluble proteins is kept and the protein concentration is determined using a commercial kit (Biorad 500-0114), the principle of which is composed of assaying by the Lowry method. The assaying of the S6 kinase phosphorylation is carried out using a commercial ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) kit (Cell signaling 7063). Briefly, 50 μg of protein lysate are deposited in the wells of a 96-well microplate and incubated overnight at 4° C. with the solution of antigen specific for the pS6 kinase threonine 389 antibody. The binding of the antigen to the bottom of the wells is done electrostatically. The solution of antibody to be assayed (pS6K T389) is then incubated at 37° C. in the wells for 2 hours. The antibodies bind specifically to the antigen. The wells are then washed with washing buffer in order to remove the antigen-specific primary antibodies to be assayed which are in excess. The third step consists in binding the detection antibody. The solution of detection antibodies is incubated at 37° C. in the wells for 1 hour. The wells are then washed in order to remove the excess detection antibodies. It should be noted that the detection antibodies are coupled to an enzyme which, in the presence of its substrate, converts it into a reaction product that can be detected and measured by virtue of the appearance of a coloration. The final step consists in revealing the bound antibodies. A revealing solution containing the substrate for the enzyme, in this case TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine), is incubated at 37° C. in the dark for 30 min. The appearance of a blue coloration in the substrate indicates the presence of the antibody to be assayed. In order to prevent any saturation phenomenon, a stop solution (generally containing sodium hydroxide) is added and brings about a change in coloration, which goes from blue to yellow. The strength thereof is proportional to the amount of enzyme present and thus to the concentration of antibody sought. The strength of the signal is measured using spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 450 nm.
Evaluation of the Effect of the Molecules in a Model of Mice Subjected to a High-Fat Diet
The 20E as comparative compound and the compounds according to the invention (Nos. 51 and 93) were administered orally, at a dose of 5 mg/kg of body weight, to 12-week-old C57BL/6J mice subjected to a high-fat diet for 6 weeks. The effect of the compounds on the weight and the amount of proteins of the Soleus muscle and also the transcripts of genes involved in myogenesis were evaluated.
Myogenesis, which is the process for forming muscle tissues, is controlled by several myogenic transcription factors which act as end effectors of the signaling cascade and produce transcripts involved in the various stages of development. The roles of the transcription factors have been described in various journals (Sabourin and Rudnicki 2000 and Le Grand and Rudnicki 2007). The Pax7 protein (Paired-box protein 7) maintains a population of satellite cells in quiescence and, with Myf5 (Myogenic factor 5), plays a role in the expansion of activated myoblasts. The MyoD protein (Myoblast Determination protein) appears to determine the differentiation potential of activated myoblasts, and cooperates with myogenin and the MEF2 (Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2) protein to control and bring about differentiation. Finally, MRF4 (Muscle-specific Regulatory Factor 4) is required for hypertrophy, even though it probably plays other roles. Quite obviously, these transcription factors do not act alone, but exist in the context of complex signaling cascades which control each step of myogenesis (Knight and Kothary, 2011).
The amount of proteins is determined by first lysing the muscles sampled in a 0.1N NaOH solution with the FastPrep technique. The proteins are quantified by means of a colorimetric assay derived from the Lowry method.
In order to carry out the gene expression analysis, the muscle tissues were homogenized in a Trizol solution (500 μl), and the RNAs were extracted and purified using the phenol/chloroform method. An amount of 1 pg of RNA was used as template for the synthesis of the first cDNA strand using oligo (dT)s as primers and the AMV reverse transcriptase enzyme as described by the supplier (Applied Biosystems 4368814). The q-PCRs were then carried out using a 7900HT machine equipped with a rapid system for real-time detection by PCR (Applied Biosystems) and the standard qPCR program (1 cycle of 95° C. for 15 min, 40 cycles of 95° C. for 15 s and 60° C. for 1 min, a 60-95° C. melt curve for the Sybergreen probes). The experiments are carried out in a Sybergreen SYBR master mix (Applied Biosystems) containing the 100 ng cDNA samples and a set of primers which bind to the two different exons and at a final concentration of 200 nM.
The relative differences in gene expression between treatments are expressed as increase or decrease in the number of cycle times [Ct] compared with the control group, the [Ct] value of each gene having been standardized with the beta-actin gene.
Oral Pharmacokinetic Study of the Molecules in Rats
The pharmacokinetics of the compounds were evaluated orally using male Wistar rats (Charles River). The 20E as comparative compound was administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight. The novel compounds according to the invention were administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight in the form of a mixture of 4 to 6 products. After administration, the blood was sampled from the tail at t=0.25 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h and 8 h. The blood samples were centrifuged and the plasmas removed. The assaying of the plasma samples made it possible to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters, namely the Cmax, which corresponds to the maximum concentration observed after the administration of the molecule, the Tmax, which is the time required to reach the maximum concentration after administration of the molecule, and the AUC: area under the curve composed of the various concentrations of compounds at the various sampling times.

The effect of the molecules on the weight and the amount of proteins of the Soleus muscle and also the transcripts of genes involved in myogenesis were evaluated.
The effects of 20E as comparative compound and of the compounds according to the invention Nos. 51 and 93 on the weight of the muscle are illustrated in FIG. 3A and the effects of 20E and of the compounds Nos. 51 and 93 on the amount of proteins of the Soleus muscle are illustrated in FIG. 3B .
All three of the 20E and the compounds administered at 5 mg/kg induce increases in the weight and in the amount of proteins of the Soleus muscle compared with the control group. The compounds in accordance with the invention show just as high an effectiveness as that of 20E. A significant increase in the protein content is even noted with compound No. 93.
The effects of 20E as comparative compound and of the administered compounds according to the invention No. 51 and No. 93, on the myostatin transcript of the Soleus muscle, are illustrated in FIG. 4 .
The 20E and the compounds Nos. 51 and 93 comparably inhibit myostatin expression in the Soleus muscle. These molecules also inhibited the myostatin transcript in the in vitro studies in the C2C12 cell lines as presented in table 4 above.
The effects of the 20E as comparative compound and of the compounds according to the invention Nos. 51 and 93 on the transcripts of MyoD and of myogenin, which are genes involved in Soleus muscle myogenesis, are respectively illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B .
The 20E and compounds Nos. 51 and 93 induce an increase in the transcripts of the MyoD gene which determines the differentiation potential and the Myf5 gene involved in the proliferation of myocytes. They also induce an increase in the transcript of the myogenin gene involved in the early differentiation of the myocytes.
Pharmacokinetic Study of the Molecules in Rats
The pharmacokinetics of 20E and of compounds according to the invention were evaluated in rats by oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg in the case of the compounds and 50 mg/kg in the case of 20E.  TABLE 6
 principal pharmacokinetic parameters (Tmax; Cmax and AUC)
 of the 20E and of the compounds tested in Wistar rats

 51  10  0.25  174  273  3.6
 93  10  0.5  230  785  10.3
Taking into account the 20E dose which is 5 times higher (50 mg/kg) compared with that of the compounds according to the invention (10 mg/kg), the coefficient of exposure Cexp [Cexp=(Dose20E×AUCcompound): (Dosecompound×AUC20E)] demonstrates the improvement in the pharmacokinetic profile of all compounds tested compared with 20E. Thus, this study in rats shows that compounds Nos. 31; 46; 51 and 93 have a better plasma exposure compared with 20E.
Overview
