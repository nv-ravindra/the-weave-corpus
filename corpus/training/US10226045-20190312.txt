The present invention relates to azoline compounds which are useful for combating or controlling invertebrate pests, in particular arthropod pests and nematodes. The invention also relates to a method for controlling invertebrate pests by using these compounds and to plant propagation material and to an agricultural and a veterinary composition comprising said compounds.
Invertebrate pests and in particular arthropods and nematodes destroy growing and harvested crops and attack wooden dwelling and commercial structures, causing large economic loss to the food supply and to property. While a large number of pesticidal agents are known, due to the ability of target pests to develop resistance to said agents, there is an on-going need for new agents for combating invertebrate pests, in particular insects, arachnids and nematodes.
Related compounds are described in WO 2013/026929, WO 2012/163959, WO 2012/007426, WO 2011/067272, WO 2010/149506, WO 2010/020522, WO 2009/080250, EP-A-1731512, JP-A-2007091708 and JP-A-2008133273. However, these documents do not describe compounds having the characteristic substituents and substituents' arrangement as claimed in the present invention.
It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds that have a good pesticidal activity, in particular insecticidal activity, and show a broad activity spectrum against a large number of different invertebrate pests, especially against difficult to control arthropod pests and/or nematodes.
The object of the present invention is moreover to provide compounds which are less persistent, bioaccumulative and/or toxic than the compounds of the prior art. Especially isoxazoline insecticides of the prior art show a high persistency in the soil and thus accumulate there.

The term “plants” comprises any types of plants including “non-cultivated plants” and in particular “cultivated plants”.
The term “non-cultivated plants” refers to any wild type species or related species or related genera of a cultivated plant.
The term “cultivated plants” is to be understood as including plants which have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering including but not limiting to agricultural biotech products on the market or in development (cf. http://www.bio.org/speeches/pubs/er/agri_products.asp). Genetically modified plants are plants, which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding, mutations or natural recombination. Typically, one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post-translational modification of protein(s), oligo- or polypeptides e. g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated, acetylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties.
Plants that have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering, e. g. have been rendered tolerant to applications of specific classes of herbicides, such as auxin herbicides such as dicamba or 2,4-D; bleacher herbicides such as hydroxyl-phenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors or phytoene desaturase (PDS) inhibit-tors; acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors such as sulfonyl ureas or imidazolinones; enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) inhibitors, such as glyphosate; glutamine synthetase (GS) inhibitors such as glufosinate; protoporphyrinogen-IX oxidase inhibitors; lipid biosynthesis inhibitors such as acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors; or oxynil (i. e. bromoxynil or ioxynil) herbicides as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. Furthermore, plants have been made resistant to multiple classes of herbicides through multiple genetic modifications, such as resistance to both glyphosate and glufosinate or to both glyphosate and a herbicide from another class such as ALS inhibitors, HPPD inhibitors, auxin herbicides, or ACCase inhibitors. These herbicide resistance technologies are e. g. described in Pest Managem. Sci. 61, 2005, 246; 61, 2005, 258; 61, 2005, 277; 61, 2005, 269; 61, 2005, 286; 64, 2008, 326; 64, 2008, 332; Weed Sci. 57, 2009, 108; Austral. J. Agricult. Res. 58, 2007, 708; Science 316, 2007, 1185; and references quoted therein. Several cultivated plants have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by conventional methods of breeding (mutagenesis), e. g. Clearfield® summer rape (Canola, BASF SE, Germany) being tolerant to imidazolinones, e. g. imazamox, or ExpressSun® sunflowers (DuPont, USA) being tolerant to sulfonyl ureas, e. g. tribenuron. Genetic engineering methods have been used to render cultivated plants such as soybean, cotton, corn, beets and rape, tolerant to herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate, some of which are commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady® (glyphosate-tolerant, Monsanto, U.S.A.), Cultivance® (imidazolinone tolerant, BASF SE, Germany) and LibertyLink® (glufosinate-tolerant, Bayer CropScience, Germany).
Furthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins, especially those known from the bacterial genus Bacillus, particularly from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as δ-endotoxins, e. g. CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryIF, CryIF(a2), CryIIA(b), CryIIIA, CryIIIB(b1) or Cry9c; vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIP), e. g. VIP1, VIP2, VIP3 or VIP3A; insecticidal proteins of bacteria colonizing nematodes, e. g. Photorhabdus spp. or Xenorhabdus spp.; toxins produced by animals, such as scorpion toxins, arachnid toxins, wasp toxins, or other insect-specific neurotoxins; toxins produced by fungi, such Streptomycetes toxins, plant lectins, such as pea or barley lectins; agglutinins; proteinase inhibitors, such as trypsin inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, patatin, cystatin or papain inhibitors; ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), such as ricin, maize-RIP, abrin, luffin, saporin or bryodin; steroid metabolism enzymes, such as 3-hydroxy-steroid oxidase, ecdysteroid-IDP-glycosyl-transferase, cholesterol oxidases, ecdysone inhibitors or HMG-CoA-reductase; ion channel blockers, such as blockers of sodium or calcium channels; juvenile hormone esterase; diuretic hormone receptors (helicokinin receptors); stilben synthase, bibenzyl synthase, chitinases or glucanases. In the context of the present invention these insecticidal proteins or toxins are to be understood expressly also as pre-toxins, hybrid proteins, truncated or otherwise modified proteins. Hybrid proteins are characterized by a new combination of protein domains, (see, e. g. WO 02/015701). Further examples of such toxins or genetically modified plants capable of synthesizing such toxins are disclosed, e. g., in EP-A 374 753, WO 93/007278, WO 95/34656, EP-A 427 529, EP-A 451 878, WO 03/18810 and WO 03/52073. The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, e. g. in the publications mentioned above. These insecticidal proteins contained in the genetically modified plants impart to the plants producing these proteins tolerance to harmful pests from all taxonomic groups of athropods, especially to beetles (Coeloptera), two-winged insects (Diptera), and moths (Lepidoptera) and to nematodes (Nematoda). Genetically modified plants capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins are, e. g., described in the publications mentioned above, and some of which are commercially available such as YieldGard® (corn cultivars producing the Cry1Ab toxin), YieldGard® Plus (corn cultivars producing Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 toxins), Starlink® (corn cultivars producing the Cry9c toxin), Herculex® RW (corn cultivars producing Cry34Ab1, Cry35Ab1 and the enzyme Phosphinothricin-N-Acetyltransferase [PAT]); NuCOTN® 33B (cotton cultivars producing the Cry1Ac toxin), Bollgard® I (cotton cultivars producing the Cry1Ac toxin), Bollgard® II (cotton cultivars producing Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab2 toxins); VIPCOT® (cotton cultivars producing a VIP-toxin); NewLeaf® (potato cultivars producing the Cry3A toxin); Bt-Xtra®, NatureGard®, KnockOut®, BiteGard®, Protecta®, Bt11 (e. g.

Furthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more proteins to increase the resistance or tolerance of those plants to bacterial, viral or fungal pathogens. Examples of such proteins are the so-called “pathogenesis-related proteins” (PR proteins, see, e. g. EP-A 392 225), plant disease resistance genes (e. g. potato cultivars, which express resistance genes acting against Phytophthora infestans derived from the mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum) or T4-lysozym (e. g. potato cultivars capable of synthesizing these proteins with increased resistance against bacteria such as Erwinia amylvora). The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, e. g. in the publications mentioned above.
Furthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more proteins to increase the productivity (e. g. bio mass production, grain yield, starch content, oil content or protein content), tolerance to drought, salinity or other growth-limiting environmental factors or tolerance to pests and fungal, bacterial or viral pathogens of those plants.
Furthermore, plants are also covered that contain by the use of recombinant DNA techniques a modified amount of substances of content or new substances of content, specifically to improve human or animal nutrition, e. g. oil crops that produce health-promoting long-chain omega-3 fatty acids or unsaturated omega-9 fatty acids (e. g. Nexera® rape, DOW Agro Sciences, Canada).
Furthermore, plants are also covered that contain by the use of recombinant DNA techniques a modified amount of substances of content or new substances of content, specifically to improve raw material production, e. g. potatoes that produce increased amounts of amylopectin (e. g. Amflora® potato, BASF SE, Germany).

Among the above compounds, preference is given to compounds Ia.1 and Ia.3.
In a specific embodiment, the compounds I are selected from the compounds specified in the examples, either as a free base or in form of an agriculturally or veterinarily acceptable salt, an N-oxide or a stereoisomer thereof.
The compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared by the methods as described in the below schemes or and in the synthesis descriptions of the working examples, or by standard methods of organic chemistry. The substituents, variables and indices are as defined above for formula (I), if not otherwise specified.
Compounds of formula I wherein X1 is O and wherein R3b is hydrogen (termed below as compounds I.a) can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula 1 as shown in scheme 1 below in an imination/Michael addition reaction with hydroxylamine. A′ is A or a precursor of A. Typical precursors of A are a halogen atom, CN, carboxy, C(O)ORz1 (carboxy and C(O)ORz1 are of course only “precursors” if in the desired compound I W is S and/or Rz1 is not the desired radical R9 and/or if Y is to be —NR5R6) or —OSO2—Rz1, where Rz1 is C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-haloalkyl or phenyl which may be substituted by 1, 2 or 3 radicals selected from C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-haloalkyl C1-C4-alkoxy or C1-C4-haloalkoxy. Compounds I′ correspond to compounds I when A′ is A. Compounds I.a′ correspond to compounds I.a when A′ is A. Suitable reaction conditions are described, for example, in WO 2012/158396. Suitably, hydroxylamine is used as the hydrochloride salt. The reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a base, such as NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3 and the like. Suitable solvents are aqueous, such as water or mixtures of water with polar solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and lower alkanols. If necessary (i.e. if A′ is a precursor of A), A′ is then converted into a group A.
Compounds of formula I wherein X1 is CH2 and wherein R3b is hydrogen (termed below as compounds I.b) can be prepared by first subjecting a compound of formula 1 to a Michael addition with nitromethane to 2, then reducing the nitro group of 2 to an amino group. The resulting aminoketone reacts spontaneously to the pyrroline I.b′, as shown in scheme 2 below. Compounds I.b′ correspond to compounds I.b when A′ is A. Suitable reaction conditions are described, for example, in US 2010/0298558. The Michael addition of nitromethane to 1 is carried out in the presence of a base. Suitable bases are for example alkali hydroxides and alcoholates, but preferably non-nucleophilic bases, such as DBN or DBU, are used. Suitable solvents depend i.a. on the base used. If an alkali hydroxide is used, suitably an aqueous medium, such as water of mixtures thereof with lower alkanols are used, while alkoxides are used in the respective alcohol. If non-nucleophilic bases are used, polar, non-protic solvents, such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like are preferred. If necessary (i.e. if A′ is a precursor of A), A′ is then converted into a group A. Reduction of 2 is carried out with a suitable reduction agent, such as Zn, Sn, Sn(II) salts, Fe or hydrogen-producing agents, such as ammonium formate in the presence of Zn or Pd.
Compound 1 can be prepared in analogy to the method described in EP-A-2172462 and as shown in scheme 3 below by subjecting the ketones 3 and 4 to an aldol condensation.
Ketone 3 can be obtained in analogy to the method described in US 2011/0152246.
Compounds I wherein W is O can be prepared by reacting a compound I′ wherein A′ is CI, Br, I or triflate with carbon monoxide in the presence of a palladium catalyst and an alcohol ROH, wherein R is C1-C4-alkyl, to a compound of formula 5. Suitable palladium catalysts are for example those described in WO 2011/161130.
If desired, this ester is then hydrolyzed to the respective carboxylic acid, which is then reacted under standard amidation conditions with an amine NHR5R6. Hydrolyzation can be carried out under standard conditions, e.g. under acidic conditions using for example hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or trifluoroacetic acid, or under basic conditions using for example an alkali metal hydroxide, such as LiOH, NaOH or KOH. Amidation is preferably carried out by activation of the carboxylic acids with oxalylchloride [(COCl)2] or thionylchloride (SOCl2) to the respective acid chlorides, followed by reaction with an amine NHR5R6. Alternatively, amidation is carried out in the presence of a coupling reagent. Suitable coupling reagent (activators) are well known and are for instance selected from carbodiimides, such as DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) and DCI (diisopropylcarbodiimide), benzotriazol derivatives, such as HATU (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), H BTU ((O-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) and HCTU (1H-benzotriazolium-1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-5-chloro tetrafluoroborate) and phosphonium-derived activators, such as BOP ((benzotriazol-1-yloxy)-tris(dimethyl-amino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate), Py-BOP ((benzotriazol-1-yloxy)-tripyrrolidinphosphonium hexafluorophosphate) and Py-BrOP (bromotripyrroli-dinphosphonium hexafluorophosphate). Generally, the activator is used in excess. The benzotriazol and phosphonium coupling reagents are generally used in a basic medium.
Compounds I wherein W is S, can be prepared by reacting the corresponding oxo-compound (W is O) with Lawesson's reagent (CAS 19172-47-5), see for example Jesberger et al., Synthesis, 2003, 1929-1958 and references therein. Solvents such as HMPA or THF at an elevated temperature such as 60° C. to 100° C. can be used. Preferred reaction conditions are THF at 65° C.
Compounds I wherein Y is OH can be prepared from compounds I wherein Y is hydrogen via oxidation of this aldehyde group A. Suitable conditions are for example those of the Pinnick or Lindgren oxidation using a chlorite, such as sodium chlorite NaClO2 as oxidation agent. As scavenger for the hypochlorite (HOCl) formed in the reaction, 2-methyl-2-butene or hydrogen peroxide can be used. The Pinnick or Lindgren oxidation is generally carried out in a water-containing solvent under slightly acidic, buffered conditions (pH ca. 3-5; use of a hydrogen phosphate, e.g. NaH2PO4). Other suitable oxidation conditions are described, for example, in WO 2011/022337. The resulting carboxylic acid can then be further esterified to give compounds I wherein Y is OR9 wherein R9 is not hydrogen, or subjected to an amidation as described above to afford compounds I wherein Y is NR5R6.
Compounds I wherein R3b is not hydrogen can be prepared from compounds I.a′ or I.b′ in analogy to the methods described in WO 2010/020521 by reacting these with a base, such as lithium diisopropylamine, followed by the addition of an electrophile, e.g. a halogenating agent, such as 4-iodotoluene difluoride, N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (“NFSI”), N-chlorosuccinimide (“NCS”), N-bromosuccinimide (“NBS”) or N-iodosuccinimide (“NIS”), an alkylating agent, such as an alkyl halide, e.g. methyl iodide, a sulfanylating agent, such as methanesulfenyl chloride (CH3S—Cl), S-methyl methanethiosulfonate (CH3SO2—SCH3) or dimethyldisulfide (CH3S—SCH3), or, for introducing OH, a hydroxylating agent, such as oxaziridines (for instance, N-sulfonyl oxaziridines) or oxodiperoxymolybdenum(pyridine)-(hexamethyl-phosphoric triamide) (“MoOPH”).
As a rule, the compounds of formula I including their stereoisomers, salts, and N-oxides, and their precursors in the synthesis process, can be prepared by the methods described above. If individual compounds can not be prepared via the above-described routes, they can be prepared by derivatization of other compounds I or the respective precursor or by customary modifications of the synthesis routes described. For example, in individual cases, certain compounds of formula (I) can advantageously be prepared from other compounds of formula (I) by derivatization, e.g. by ester hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, ether cleavage, olefination, reduction, oxidation and the like, or by customary modifications of the synthesis routes described.
The reaction mixtures are worked up in the customary manner, for example by mixing with water, separating the phases, and, if appropriate, purifying the crude products by chromatography, for example on alumina or on silica gel. Some of the intermediates and end products may be obtained in the form of colorless or pale brown viscous oils which are freed or purified from volatile components under reduced pressure and at moderately elevated temperature. If the intermediates and end products are obtained as solids, they may be purified by recrystallization or trituration.

The invention also relates to agrochemical compositions comprising an auxiliary and at least one compound I according to the invention.
An agrochemical composition comprises a pesticidally effective amount of a compound I. The term “effective amount” denotes an amount of the composition or of the compounds I, which is sufficient for controlling harmful fungi on cultivated plants or in the protection of materials and which does not result in a substantial damage to the treated plants. Such an amount can vary in a broad range and is dependent on various factors, such as the species to be controlled, the treated cultivated plant or material, the climatic conditions and the specific compound I used.
The compounds I, their N-oxides and salts can be converted into customary types of agrochemical compositions, e.g. solutions, emulsions, suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes, granules, pressings, capsules, and mixtures thereof. Examples for composition types are suspensions (e.g. SC, OD, FS), emulsifiable concentrates (e.g. EC), emulsions (e.g. EW, EO, ES, ME), capsules (e.g. CS, ZC), pastes, pastilles, wettable powders or dusts (e.g. WP, SP, WS, DP, DS), pressings (e.g. BR, TB, DT), granules (e.g. WG, SG, GR, FG, GG, MG), insecticidal articles (e.g. LN), as well as gel formulations for the treatment of plant propagation materials such as seeds (e.g. GF).

Preferably, compound I or the compositions thereof, respectively, are applied on to the plant propagation material by a method such that germination is not induced, e.g. by seed dressing, pelleting, coating and dusting.
When employed in plant protection, the amounts of active substances applied are, depending on the kind of effect desired, from 0.001 to 2 kg per ha, preferably from 0.005 to 2 kg per ha, more preferably from 0.05 to 0.9 kg per ha, and in particular from 0.1 to 0.75 kg per ha.
In treatment of plant propagation materials such as seeds, e.g. by dusting, coating or drenching seed, amounts of active substance of from 0.1 to 1000 g, preferably from 1 to 1000 g, more preferably from 1 to 100 g and most preferably from 5 to 100 g, per 100 kilogram of plant propagation material (preferably seeds) are generally required.
When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the amount of active substance applied depends on the kind of application area and on the desired effect. Amounts customarily applied in the protection of materials are 0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active substance per cubic meter of treated material.
Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, fertilizer, or micronutrients, and further pesticides (e.g. herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, growth regulators, safeners) may be added to the active substances or the compositions comprising them as premix or, if appropriate not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the compositions according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1:100 to 100:1, preferably 1:10 to 10:1.
The user applies the composition according to the invention usually from a predosage device, a knapsack sprayer, a spray tank, a spray plane, or an irrigation system. Usually, the agrochemical composition is made up with water, buffer, and/or further auxiliaries to the desired application concentration and the ready-to-use spray liquor or the agrochemical composition according to the invention is thus obtained. Usually, 20 to 2000 liters, preferably 50 to 400 liters, of the ready-to-use spray liquor are applied per hectare of agricultural useful area.
According to one embodiment, individual components of the composition according to the invention such as parts of a kit or parts of a binary or ternary mixture may be mixed by the user himself in a spray tank and further auxiliaries may be added, if appropriate.
In a further embodiment, either individual components of the composition according to the invention or partially premixed components, e.g. components comprising compounds I and/or active substances from the groups M) or F) (see below), may be mixed by the user in a spray tank and further auxiliaries and additives may be added, if appropriate.
In a further embodiment, either individual components of the composition according to the invention or partially premixed components, e. g. components comprising compounds I and/or active substances from the groups M.1 to M.UN.X or F.I to F.XIII, can be applied jointly (e.g. after tank mix) or consecutively.

The invertebrate pest (also referred to as “animal pest”), i.e. the insects, arachnids and nematodes, the plant, soil or water in which the plant is growing or may grow can be contacted with the compounds of the present invention or composition(s) comprising them by any application method known in the art. As such, “contacting” includes both direct contact (applying the compounds/compositions directly on the invertebrate pest or plant—typically to the foliage, stem or roots of the plant) and indirect contact (applying the compounds/compositions to the locus of the invertebrate pest or plant).
The compounds of the present invention or the pesticidal compositions comprising them may be used to protect growing plants and crops from attack or infestation by animal pests, especially insects, acaridae or arachnids by contacting the plant/crop with a pesticidally effective amount of compounds of the present invention. The term “crop” refers both to growing and harvested crops.
The compounds of the present invention and the compositions comprising them are particularly important in the control of a multitude of insects on various cultivated plants, such as cereal, root crops, oil crops, vegetables, spices, ornamentals, for example seed of durum and other wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize (fodder maize and sugar maize/sweet and field corn), soybeans, oil crops, crucifers, cotton, sunflowers, bananas, rice, oilseed rape, turnip rape, sugarbeet, fodder beet, eggplants, potatoes, grass, lawn, turf, fodder grass, tomatoes, leeks, pumpkin/squash, cabbage, iceberg lettuce, pepper, cucumbers, melons, Brassica species, melons, beans, peas, garlic, onions, carrots, tuberous plants such as potatoes, sugar cane, tobacco, grapes, petunias, geranium/pelargoniums, pansies and impatiens.
The compounds of the present invention are employed as such or in form of compositions by treating the insects or the plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, soil, surfaces, materials or rooms to be protected from insecticidal attack with an insecticidally effective amount of the active compounds. The application can be carried out both before and after the infection of the plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, soil, surfaces, materials or rooms by the insects.
Moreover, invertebrate pests may be controlled by contacting the target pest, its food supply, habitat, breeding ground or its locus with a pesticidally effective amount of compounds of the present invention. As such, the application may be carried out before or after the infection of the locus, growing crops, or harvested crops by the pest.
The compounds of the present invention can also be applied preventively to places at which occurrence of the pests is expected.
The compounds of the present invention may be also used to protect growing plants from attack or infestation by pests by contacting the plant with a pesticidally effective amount of compounds of the present invention. As such, “contacting” includes both direct contact (applying the compounds/compositions directly on the pest and/or plant—typically to the foliage, stem or roots of the plant) and indirect contact (applying the compounds/compositions to the locus of the pest and/or plant).
“Locus” means a habitat, breeding ground, plant, seed, soil, area, material or environment in which a pest or parasite is growing or may grow.
In general, “pesticidally effective amount” means the amount of active ingredient needed to achieve an observable effect on growth, including the effects of necrosis, death, retardation, prevention, and removal, destruction, or otherwise diminishing the occurrence and activity of the target organism. The pesticidally effective amount can vary for the various compounds/compositions used in the invention. A pesticidally effective amount of the compositions will also vary according to the prevailing conditions such as desired pesticidal effect and duration, weather, target species, locus, mode of application, and the like.
In the case of soil treatment or of application to the pests dwelling place or nest, the quantity of active ingredient ranges from 0.0001 to 500 g per 100 m2, preferably from 0.001 to 20 g per 100 m2.
Customary application rates in the protection of materials are, for example, from 0.01 g to 1000 g of active compound per m2 treated material, desirably from 0.1 g to 50 g per m2.
Insecticidal compositions for use in the impregnation of materials typically contain from 0.001 to 95 weight %, preferably from 0.1 to 45 weight %, and more preferably from 1 to 25 weight % of at least one repellent and/or insecticide.
For use in treating crop plants, the rate of application of the active ingredients of this invention may be in the range of 0.1 g to 4000 g per hectare, desirably from 5 g to 500 g per hectare, more desirably from 5 g to 200 g per hectare.
The compounds of the present invention are effective through both contact (via soil, glass, wall, bed net, carpet, plant parts or animal parts), and ingestion (bait, or plant part).
The compounds of the present invention may also be applied against non-crop insect pests, such as ants, termites, wasps, flies, mosquitos, crickets, or cockroaches. For use against said non-crop pests, compounds of the present invention are preferably used in a bait composition.
The bait can be a liquid, a solid or a semisolid preparation (e.g. a gel). Solid baits can be formed into various shapes and forms suitable to the respective application e.g. granules, blocks, sticks, disks. Liquid baits can be filled into various devices to ensure proper application, e.g. open containers, spray devices, droplet sources, or evaporation sources. Gels can be based on aqueous or oily matrices and can be formulated to particular necessities in terms of stickyness, moisture retention or aging characteristics. The bait employed in the composition is a product, which is sufficiently attractive to incite insects such as ants, termites, wasps, flies, mosquitos, crickets etc. or cockroaches to eat it. The attractiveness can be manipulated by using feeding stimulants or sex pheromones. Food stimulants are chosen, for example, but not exclusively, from animal and/or plant proteins (meat-, fish- or blood meal, insect parts, egg yolk), from fats and oils of animal and/or plant origin, or mono-, oligo- or polyorganosaccharides, especially from sucrose, lactose, fructose, dextrose, glucose, starch, pectin or even molasses or honey. Fresh or decaying parts of fruits, crops, plants, animals, insects or specific parts thereof can also serve as a feeding stimulant. Sex pheromones are known to be more insect specific. Specific pheromones are described in the literature and are known to those skilled in the art. For use in bait compositions, the typical content of active ingredient is from 0.001 weight % to 15 weight %, desirably from 0.001 weight % to 5% weight % of active ingredient.
Formulations of compounds of the present invention as aerosols (e.g in spray cans), oil sprays or pump sprays are highly suitable for the non-professional user for controlling pests such as flies, fleas, ticks, mosquitos or cockroaches. Aerosol recipes are preferably composed of the active compound, solvents such as lower alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol), ketones (e.g. acetone, methyl ethyl ketone), paraffin hydrocarbons (e.g. kerosenes) having boiling ranges of approximately 50 to 250° C., dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, water, furthermore auxiliaries such as emulsifiers such as sorbitol monooleate, oleyl ethoxylate having 3-7 mol of ethylene oxide, fatty alcohol ethoxylate, perfume oils such as ethereal oils, esters of medium fatty acids with lower alcohols, aromatic carbonyl compounds, if appropriate stabilizers such as sodium benzoate, amphoteric surfactants, lower epoxides, triethyl orthoformate and, if required, propellants such as propane, butane, nitrogen, compressed air, dimethyl ether, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, or mixtures of these gases.
The oil spray formulations differ from the aerosol recipes in that no propellants are used.
For use in spray compositions, the content of active ingredient is from 0.001 to 80 weights %, preferably from 0.01 to 50 weight % and most preferably from 0.01 to 15 weight %.
The compounds of the present invention and its respective compositions can also be used in mosquito and fumigating coils, smoke cartridges, vaporizer plates or long-term vaporizers and also in moth papers, moth pads or other heat-independent vaporizer systems.
Methods to control infectious diseases transmitted by insects (e.g. malaria, dengue and yellow fever, lymphatic filariasis, and leishmaniasis) with compounds of the present invention and its respective compositions also comprise treating surfaces of huts and houses, air spraying and impregnation of curtains, tents, clothing items, bed nets, tsetse-fly trap or the like. Insecticidal compositions for application to fibers, fabric, knitgoods, nonwovens, netting material or foils and tarpaulins preferably comprise a mixture including the insecticide, optionally a repellent and at least one binder. Suitable repellents for example are N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), N,N-diethylphenylacetamide (DEPA), 1-(3-cyclohexan-1-yl-carbonyl)-2-methylpiperine, (2-hydroxymethylcyclohexyl) acetic acid lactone, 2-ethyl-1,3-hexandiol, indalone, Methylneodecanamide (MNDA), a pyrethroid not used for insect control such as {(+/−)-3-allyl-2-methyl-4-oxocyclopent-2-(+)-enyl-(+)-trans-chrysantemate (Esbiothrin), a repellent derived from or identical with plant extracts like limonene, eugenol, (+)-Eucamalol (1), (−)-1-epi-eucamalol or crude plant extracts from plants like Eucalyptus maculata, Vitex rotundifolia, Cymbopogan martinii, Cymbopogan citratus (lemon grass), Cymopogan nartdus (citronella). Suitable binders are selected for example from polymers and copolymers of vinyl esters of aliphatic acids (such as such as vinyl acetate and vinyl versatate), acrylic and methacrylic esters of alcohols, such as butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexylacrylate, and methyl acrylate, mono- and di-ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as styrene, and aliphatic diens, such as butadiene.
The impregnation of curtains and bednets is done in general by dipping the textile material into emulsions or dispersions of the insecticide or spraying them onto the nets.
The compounds of the present invention and their compositions can be used for protecting wooden materials such as trees, board fences, sleepers, etc. and buildings such as houses, outhouses, factories, but also construction materials, furniture, leathers, fibers, vinyl articles, electric wires and cables etc. from ants and/or termites, and for controlling ants and termites from doing harm to crops or human being (e.g. when the pests invade into houses and public facilities). The compounds of the present invention are applied not only to the surrounding soil surface or into the under-floor soil in order to protect wooden materials but it can also be applied to lumbered articles such as surfaces of the under-floor concrete, alcove posts, beams, plywoods, furniture, etc., wooden articles such as particle boards, half boards, etc. and vinyl articles such as coated electric wires, vinyl sheets, heat insulating material such as styrene foams, etc. In case of application against ants doing harm to crops or human beings, the ant controller of the present invention is applied to the crops or the surrounding soil, or is directly applied to the nest of ants or the like.
The compounds of the present invention are also suitable for the treatment of plant propagation material, especially seeds, in order to protect them from insect pest, in particular from soil-living insect pests and the resulting plant's roots and shoots against soil pests and foliar insects.
The compounds of the present invention are particularly useful for the protection of the seed from soil pests and the resulting plant's roots and shoots against soil pests and foliar insects. The protection of the resulting plant's roots and shoots is preferred. More preferred is the protection of resulting plant's shoots from piercing and sucking insects, wherein the protection from aphids is most preferred.
The present invention therefore comprises a method for the protection of seeds from insects, in particular from soil insects and of the seedlings' roots and shoots from insects, in particular from soil and foliar insects, said method comprising contacting the seeds before sowing and/or after pregermination with a compound of the present invention, including a salt thereof. Particularly preferred is a method, wherein the plant's roots and shoots are protected, more preferably a method, wherein the plants shoots are protected form piercing and sucking insects, most preferably a method, wherein the plants shoots are protected from aphids.
The term seed embraces seeds and plant propagules of all kinds including but not limited to true seeds, seed pieces, suckers, corms, bulbs, fruit, tubers, grains, cuttings, cut shoots and the like and means in a preferred embodiment true seeds.
The term seed treatment comprises all suitable seed treatment techniques known in the art, such as seed dressing, seed coating, seed dusting, seed soaking and seed pelleting.
The present invention also comprises seeds coated with or containing the active compound.
The term “coated with and/or containing” generally signifies that the active ingredient is for the most part on the surface of the propagation product at the time of application, although a greater or lesser part of the ingredient may penetrate into the propagation product, depending on the method of application. When the said propagation product is (re)planted, it may absorb the active ingredient.
Suitable seed is seed of cereals, root crops, oil crops, vegetables, spices, ornamentals, for example seed of durum and other wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize (fodder maize and sugar maize/sweet and field corn), soybeans, oil crops, crucifers, cotton, sunflowers, bananas, rice, oilseed rape, turnip rape, sugarbeet, fodder beet, eggplants, potatoes, grass, lawn, turf, fodder grass, tomatoes, leeks, pumpkin/squash, cabbage, iceberg lettuce, pepper, cucumbers, melons, Brassica species, melons, beans, peas, garlic, onions, carrots, tuberous plants such as potatoes, sugar cane, tobacco, grapes, petunias, geranium/pelargoniums, pansies and impatiens. In addition, the active compound may also be used for the treatment seeds from plants, which tolerate the action of herbicides or fungicides or insecticides owing to breeding, including genetic engineering methods.
For example, the active compound can be employed in treatment of seeds from plants, which are resistant to herbicides from the group consisting of the sulfonylureas, imidazolinones, glufosinate-ammonium or glyphosate-isopropylammonium and analogous active substances (see for example, EP-A 242 236, EP-A 242 246) (WO 92/00377) (EP-A 257 993, U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,659) or in transgenic crop plants, for example cotton, with the capability of producing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins (Bt toxins) which make the plants resistant to certain pests (EP-A 142 924, EP-A 193 259), Furthermore, the active compound can be used also for the treatment of seeds from plants, which have modified characteristics in comparison with existing plants consist, which can be generated for example by traditional breeding methods and/or the generation of mutants, or by recombinant procedures). For example, a number of cases have been described of recombinant modifications of crop plants for the purpose of modifying the starch synthesized in the plants (e.g. WO 92/11376, WO 92/14827, WO 91/19806) or of transgenic crop plants having a modified fatty acid composition (WO 91/13972).
The seed treatment application of the active compound is carried out by spraying or by dusting the seeds before sowing of the plants and before emergence of the plants.
Compositions which are especially useful for seed treatment are e.g.:
A Soluble concentrates (SL, LS)
D Emulsions (EW, EO, ES)
E Suspensions (SC, OD, FS)
F Water-dispersible granules and water-soluble granules (WG, SG)
G Water-dispersible powders and water-soluble powders (WP, SP, WS)
H Gel-Formulations (GF)
I Dustable powders (DP, DS)
Conventional seed treatment formulations include for example flowable concentrates FS, solutions LS, powders for dry treatment DS, water dispersible powders for slurry treatment WS, water-soluble powders SS and emulsion ES and EC and gel formulation GF. These formulations can be applied to the seed diluted or undiluted. Application to the seeds is carried out before sowing, either directly on the seeds or after having pregerminated the latter.
In a preferred embodiment a FS formulation is used for seed treatment. Typically, a FS formulation may comprise 1-800 g/l of active ingredient, 1-200 g/I Surfactant, 0 to 200 g/I antifreezing agent, 0 to 400 g/l of binder, 0 to 200 g/l of a pigment and up to 1 liter of a solvent, preferably water.
Especially preferred FS formulations of compounds of the present invention for seed treatment usually comprise from 0.1 to 80% by weight (1 to 800 g/I) of the active ingredient, from 0.1 to 20% by weight (1 to 200 g/I) of at least one surfactant, e.g. 0.05 to 5% by weight of a wetter and from 0.5 to 15% by weight of a dispersing agent, up to 20% by weight, e.g. from 5 to 20% of an anti-freeze agent, from 0 to 15% by weight, e.g. 1 to 15% by weight of a pigment and/or a dye, from 0 to 40% by weight, e.g. 1 to 40% by weight of a binder (sticker/adhesion agent), optionally up to 5% by weight, e.g. from 0.1 to 5% by weight of a thickener, optionally from 0.1 to 2% of an anti-foam agent, and optionally a preservative such as a biocide, antioxidant or the like, e.g. in an amount from 0.01 to 1% by weight and a filler/vehicle up to 100% by weight.
Seed Treatment formulations may additionally also comprise binders and optionally colorants.
Binders can be added to improve the adhesion of the active materials on the seeds after treatment. Suitable binders are homo- and copolymers from alkylene oxides like ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, polyvinylacetate, polyvinylalcohols, polyvinylpyrrolidones, and copolymers thereof, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, acrylic homo- and copolymers, polyethyleneamines, polyethyleneamides and polyethyleneimines, polysaccharides like celluloses, tylose and starch, polyolefin homo- and copolymers like olefin/maleic anhydride copolymers, polyurethanes, polyesters, polystyrene homo and copolymers.
Optionally, also colorants can be included in the formulation. Suitable colorants or dyes for seed treatment formulations are Rhodamin B, C.I. Pigment Red 112, C.I. Solvent Red 1, pigment blue 15:4, pigment blue 15:3, pigment blue 15:2, pigment blue 15:1, pigment blue 80, pigment yellow 1, pigment yellow 13, pigment red 112, pigment red 48:2, pigment red 48:1, pigment red 57:1, pigment red 53:1, pigment orange 43, pigment orange 34, pigment orange 5, pigment green 36, pigment green 7, pigment white 6, pigment brown 25, basic violet 10, basic violet 49, acid red 51, acid red 52, acid red 14, acid blue 9, acid yellow 23, basic red 10, basic red 108.

In the treatment of seed, the application rates of the compounds of the present invention are generally from 0.01 g to 10 kg per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 0.05 g to 5 kg per 100 kg of seed, more preferably from 0.1 g to 1000 g per 100 kg of seed and in particular from 0.1 g to 200 g per 100 kg of seed.
The invention therefore also relates to seed comprising a compound of the present invention, including an agriculturally useful salt of it, as defined herein. The amount of the compound of the present invention, including an agriculturally useful salt thereof will in general vary from 0.01 g to 10 kg per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 0.05 g to 5 kg per 100 kg of seed, in particular from 0.1 g to 1000 g per 100 kg of seed. For specific crops such as lettuce the rate can be higher.
Methods which can be employed for treating the seed are, in principle, all suitable seed treatment and especially seed dressing techniques known in the art, such as seed coating (e.g. seed pelleting), seed dusting and seed imbibition (e.g. seed soaking). Here, “seed treatment” refers to all methods that bring seeds and the compounds of the present invention into contact with each other, and “seed dressing” to methods of seed treatment which provide the seeds with an amount of the compounds of the present invention, i.e. which generate a seed comprising a compound of the present invention. In principle, the treatment can be applied to the seed at any time from the harvest of the seed to the sowing of the seed. The seed can be treated immediately before, or during, the planting of the seed, for example using the “planter's box” method. However, the treatment may also be carried out several weeks or months, for example up to 12 months, before planting the seed, for example in the form of a seed dressing treatment, without a substantially reduced efficacy being observed.
Expediently, the treatment is applied to unsown seed. As used herein, the term “unsown seed” is meant to include seed at any period from the harvest of the seed to the sowing of the seed in the ground for the purpose of germination and growth of the plant.
Specifically, a procedure is followed in the treatment in which the seed is mixed, in a suitable device, for example a mixing device for solid or solid/liquid mixing partners, with the desired amount of seed treatment formulations, either as such or after previous dilution with water, until the composition is distributed uniformly on the seed. If appropriate, this is followed by a drying step.
The compounds of the present invention, including their stereoisomers, veterinarily acceptable salts or N-oxides, are in particular also suitable for being used for combating parasites in and on animals.
An object of the present invention is therefore also to provide new methods to control parasites in and on animals. Another object of the invention is to provide safer pesticides for animals. Another object of the invention is further to provide pesticides for animals that may be used in lower doses than existing pesticides. And another object of the invention is to provide pesticides for animals, which provide a long residual control of the parasites.
The invention also relates to compositions comprising a parasiticidally effective amount of compounds of the present invention, including their stereoisomers, veterinarily acceptable salts or N-oxides, and an acceptable carrier, for combating parasites in and on animals.
The present invention also provides a method for treating, controlling, preventing and protecting animals against infestation and infection by parasites, which comprises orally, topically or parenterally administering or applying to the animals a parasiticidally effective amount of a compound of the present invention, including its stereoisomers, veterinarily acceptable salts or N-oxides, or a composition comprising it.
The invention also provides the use of a compound of the present invention, including its stereoisomers, veterinarily acceptable salts or N-oxides, for treating or protecting an animal from infestation or infection by invertebrate pests.
The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a composition for treating, controlling, preventing or protecting animals against infestation or infection by parasites which comprises a parasiticidally effective amount of a compound of the present invention, including its stereoisomers, veterinarily acceptable salts or N-oxides, or a composition comprising it.
Activity of compounds against agricultural pests does not suggest their suitability for control of endo- and ectoparasites in and on animals which requires, for example, low, non-emetic dosages in the case of oral application, metabolic compatibility with the animal, low toxicity, and a safe handling.
Surprisingly it has now been found that compounds of formula (I) and their stereoisomers, veterinarily acceptable salts, tautomers and N-oxides, are suitable for combating endo- and ectoparasites in and on animals.
The compounds of the present invention, especially compounds of formula (I) and their stereoisomers, veterinarily acceptable salts, tautomers and N-oxides, and compositions comprising them are preferably used for controlling and preventing infestations of and infections in animals including warm-blooded animals (including humans) and fish. They are for example suitable for controlling and preventing infestations and infections in mammals such as cattle, sheep, swine, camels, deer, horses, pigs, poultry, rabbits, goats, dogs and cats, water buffalo, donkeys, fallow deer and reindeer, and also in fur-bearing animals such as mink, chinchilla and raccoon, birds such as hens, geese, turkeys and ducks and fish such as fresh- and salt-water fish such as trout, carp and eels.
Compounds of the present invention, including their stereoisomers, veterinarily acceptable salts or N-oxides, and compositions comprising them are preferably used for controlling and preventing infestations and infections in domestic animals, such as dogs or cats.
Infestations in warm-blooded animals and fish include, but are not limited to, lice, biting lice, ticks, nasal bots, keds, biting flies, muscoid flies, flies, myiasitic fly larvae, chiggers, gnats, mosquitoes and fleas.

The present invention relates to the therapeutic and the non-therapeutic use of compounds of the present invention and compositions comprising them for controlling and/or combating parasites in and/or on animals. The compounds of the present invention and compositions comprising them may be used to protect the animals from attack or infestation by parasites by contacting them with a parasiticidally effective amount of compounds of the present invention and compositions containing them. The compounds of the present invention and compositions comprising them can be effective through both contact (via soil, glass, wall, bed net, carpet, blankets or animal parts) and ingestion (e.g. baits). As such, “contacting” includes both direct contact (applying the pesticidal mixtures/compositions containing the compounds of the present invention directly on the parasite, which may include an indirect contact at its locus-P, and optionally also administrating the pesticidal mixtures/composition directly on the animal to be protected) and indirect contact (applying the compounds/compositions to the locus of the parasite). The contact of the parasite through application to its locus is an example of a non-therapeutic use of compounds of the present invention. “Locus-P” as used above means the habitat, food supply, breeding ground, area, material or environment in which a parasite is growing or may grow outside of the animal.
In general, “parasiticidally effective amount” means the amount of active ingredient needed to achieve an observable effect on growth, including the effects of necrosis, death, retardation, prevention, and removal, destruction, or otherwise diminishing the occurrence and activity of the target organism. The parasiticidally effective amount can vary for the various compounds/compositions of the present invention. A parasiticidally effective amount of the compositions will also vary according to the prevailing conditions such as desired parasiticidal effect and duration, target species, mode of application, and the like.
The compounds of the present invention can also be applied preventively to places at which occurrence of the pests or parasites are expected.
Administration can be carried out both prophylactically and therapeutically.
Administration of the active compounds is carried out directly or in the form of suitable preparations, orally, topically/dermally or parenterally.
The compounds of the invention are better bio-degradable than those of the prior art and in addition retain a high level of pest control. This makes them superior in terms of environmental safety. In light of the structural similarities of the compounds of formula I, this significant difference in bio-degradability in favour of the compounds of the invention is unexpected and cannot be derived from what is known from the prior art.
