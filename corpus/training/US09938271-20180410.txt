BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The disclosure generally relates to compounds, compositions, and methods for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The disclosure provides novel inhibitors of HIV, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds, and methods for using these compounds in the treatment of HIV infection.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been identified as the etiological agent responsible for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a fatal disease characterized by destruction of the immune system and the inability to fight off life threatening opportunistic infections. Recent statistics indicate that an estimated 35.3 million people worldwide are infected with the virus (UNAIDS: Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic, 2013). In addition to the large number of individuals already infected, the virus continues to spread. Estimates from 2013 point to close to 3.4 million new infections in that year alone. In the same year there were approximately 1.6 million deaths associated with HIV and AIDS.
There are currently a number of antiviral drugs available to combat the infection. These drugs can be divided into classes based on the viral protein they target or their mode of action. In particular, saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir atazanavir darunavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, lopinavir and tipranavir are competitive inhibitors of the aspartyl protease expressed by HIV. Zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, lamivudine, zalcitabine, emtricitibine, tenofovir and abacavir are nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors that behave as substrate mimics to halt viral cDNA synthesis. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz and etravirine inhibit the synthesis of viral cDNA via a non-competitive (or uncompetitive) mechanism. Enfuvirtide and maraviroc inhibit the entry of the virus into the host cell. An HIV integrase inhibitor, raltegravir (MK-0518, Isentress®), has also been approved for use in treatment experienced patients, and it is clear that this class of inhibitors is very effective as part of a combination regimen containing HIV inhibitors of different classes.
Used alone, these drugs are effective in reducing viral replication: However, the effect is only temporary as the virus readily develops resistance to all known agents used as monotherapy. On the other hand, combination therapy has proven very effective at both reducing virus and suppressing the emergence of resistance in a number of patients. In the US, where combination therapy is widely available, the number of HIV-related deaths has dramatically declined (Palella, F. J.; Delany, K. M.; Moorman, A. C.; Loveless, M. O.; Furher, J.; Satten, G. A.; Aschman, D. J.; Holmberg, S. D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998, 338, 853-860).
Unfortunately, not all patients are responsive and a large number fail this therapy. In fact, initial studies suggest that approximately 30-50% of patients ultimately fail at least one drug in the suppressive combination. Treatment failure in most cases is caused by the emergence of viral resistance. Viral resistance in turn is caused by the replication rate of HIV-1 during the course of infection combined with the relatively high viral mutation rate associated with the viral polymerase and the lack of adherence of HIV-infected individuals in taking their prescribed medications. Clearly, there is a need for new antiviral agents, preferably with activity against viruses already resistant to currently approved drugs. Other important factors include improved safety and a more convenient dosing regimen than many of the currently approved drugs.
Compounds which inhibit HIV replication have been disclosed. See WO2007131350, WO2009062285, WO2009062288, WO2009062289, WO2009062308, WO2010130034, WO2010130842, WO2011015641, WO2011076765, WO2012003497, WO2012003498, WO2012033735, WO2012065963, WO2012066442, WO2014021867, WO20140028384, WO2014164428, WO2014164409, and WO2014159959.
The invention provides technical advantages, for example, the compounds are novel and are useful in the treatment of HIV. Additionally, the compounds provide advantages for pharmaceutical uses, for example, with regard to one or more of their mechanism of action, binding, inhibition efficacy, target selectivity, solubility, safety profiles, or bioavailability.

Biological Methods
Inhibition of HIV Replication:
A recombinant NL-RLuc proviral clone was constructed in which a section of the nef gene from NL4-3 was replaced with the Renilla Luciferase gene. This virus is fully infectious and can undergo multiple cycles of replication in cell culture. In addition, the luciferous reporter provides a simple and easy method for quantitating the extent of virus growth and consequently, the antiviral activity of test compounds. The plasmid pNLRLuc contains the proviral NL-Rluc DNA cloned into pUC 18 at the PvuII site. The NL-RLuc virus was prepared by transfection of 293T cells with the plasmid pNLRLuc. Transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE PLUS kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) according to the manufacturer and the virus generated was titered in MT-2 cells. For susceptibility analyses, the titrated virus was used to infect MT-2 cells in the presence of compound, and after 5 days of incubation, cells were processed and quantitated for virus growth by the amount of expressed luciferase. Assay media was RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin G/100 units/ml streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.55 and 2 mM L-glutamine. The results from at least 2 experiments were used to calculate the EC50 values. Luciferase was quantitated using the Dual Luciferase kit from Promega (Madison, Wis.). Susceptibility of viruses to compounds was determined by incubation in the presence of serial dilutions of the compound. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) was calculated by using the exponential form of the median effect equation where (Fa)=1/[1+(ED50/drug conc.)m] (Johnson V A, Byington R T. Infectivity Assay. In Techniques in HIV Research. ed. Aldovini A, Walker B D. 71-76. New York: Stockton Press. 1990). Results are shown in Table 1. Activity equal to A refers to a compound having an EC50≤100 nM, while B and C denote compounds having an EC50 between 100 nM and 1 uM (B) or >1 uM (C).  TABLE 1

Step 1: Preparation of ethyl (S)-2-(tert-butoxy)-2-((S,Z)-23-(tert-butyl)-44-fluoro-14,26,6-trimethyl-5,11-dioxa-2(8,2)-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridina-1(1,4)-piperidina-3(1,3),4(1,2)-dibenzenacycloundecaphane-27-yl)acetate
2-Bromo-2-methylpropane (45 μl, 0.39 mmol) was added to a stirring slurry of ethyl (2S)-[(22S)-18-fluoro-4,22,28-trimethyl-21,27-dioxa-1,6,8-triazahexacyclo[26.2.2.16,9.110,14.02,7.015,20]tetratriaconta-2,4,7,9(34),10(33),11,13,15,17,19-decaen-3-yl](hydroxy)acetate (40 mg, 0.065 mmol) and silver oxide (45 mg, 0.20 mmol) in dichloromethane (1.3 ml) and cyclohexane (1.3 ml) at rt under N2 balloon. The reaction was allowed to stir 4 h. Then an additional aliquot of reagents: silver oxide (45 mg, 0.20 mmol) and 2-bromo-2-methylpropane (45 μl, 0.39 mmol) were added and the reaction was allowed to stir for 3 days at 35° C. The reaction was concentrated, adsorbed onto Celite and purified on silica gel (Biotage, EtOAc/hexanes gradient, fraction collection at λ=254 nm) to give the expected product (5.0 mg, 6.9 μmol, 11% yield). LC-MS retention time: 1.55 min; m/z (MH+): 728. LC data was recorded on a Shimadzu LC-10AS liquid chromatograph equipped with a Waters Aquity BEH C18 2.1×50 mm 1.7 um column using a SPD-10AV UV-Vis detector at a detector wave length of 220 nM. The elution conditions employed a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min, a gradient of 98% solvent A/2% solvent B to 98% solvent A/2% solvent B, a gradient time of 1.5 min, a hold time of 0.5 min, and an analysis time of 2 min where solvent A was 10% acetonitrile/90% H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B was 10% H2O/90% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MS data was determined using a Micromass Platform for LC in electrospray mode.

The reaction was allowed to stir at 65° C. for 16 h. The mixture was then diluted with EtOAc and washed with aq 1M HCl, and sat aq NaCl.
