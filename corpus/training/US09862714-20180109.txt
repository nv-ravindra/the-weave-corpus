BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The Wnt pathway is an evolutionarily conserved growth pathway in multicellular organisms that regulates animal development and plays critical roles in human disease. Signaling through the Wnt pathway is regulated by secreted Wnt proteins, which act as morphogens to mediate 1) cell fate determination and differentiation required for establishing the body plan, neural patterning, and organogenesis, 2) cell motility and polarity, 3) cell proliferation and apoptosis, and 4) stem cell maintenance.
In Wnt signaling, the transcriptional coactivator, beta-catenin, is constitutively degraded in the absence of a Wnt signal thereby allowing a cell to maintain low cytoplasmic levels of beta-catenin and keeping the Wnt pathway in the “off” position. Degradation of beta-catenin requires its recruitment into a complex consisting primarily of Glycogen synthase kinase (Gsk3), Casein Kinase 1 (CK1), Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), Axin, and the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Within this complex, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by CK1, which primes it for further phosphorylation by Gsk3. Phosphorylated beta-catenin is recognized by the SCF (Skip1, Cullen, F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex, of which the specificity F-box determinant is beta-TRCP, and targeted for polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. The Wnt pathway is turned “on” upon binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled family of receptors and the coreceptor family members LDL receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6), which results in translocation of the beta-catenin destruction complex to the membrane through interaction of Axin with LRP5/6. The interaction between Axin and LRP5/6 is promoted by the phosphorylation of LRP5/6 by CK1 and Gsk3, and Axin-LRP5/6 interaction results in inhibition of beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. Because beta-catenin is continually synthesized in cells, its cytoplasmic concentration increases, and it enters the nucleus and forms a complex with the TCF/LEF1 family of transcriptional factors (as well as the nuclear proteins BCL9 and Pygopus) to regulate a Wnt-specific transcriptional program.
Our bodies are composed of numerous cell types specialized to perform specific functions. These specialized or differentiated cells are derived from a small group of stem and progenitor cells that have the capacity to divide asymmetrically, allowing them to regenerate themselves, and also giving rise to a daughter cell that can differentiate into cell types characteristic of various organs in our bodies. It is recognized that diseases like diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease are caused by death or dysfunction of differentiated cells in tissues where stem cells are limiting. These diseases may be caused by loss of stem cell activity and/or misregulation of critical signaling pathways in stem cells residing in tissues such as the pancreas, brain, and heart. The Wnt pathway is a key regulator of stem cell behavior and viability, and modulation of this pathway presents a method of treating diseases associated with dysfunctional stem cell activity. For example, activation of the Wnt pathway has been associated with heart failure, and inhibition of Wnt signaling has been shown to improve recovery after a heart attack in animal models. Thus, Wnt inhibitors could have broad applications in regenerative (stem cell) medicine for the treatment of major human diseases such as heart disease.
Cancer has been shown to be stem cell related disease, resulting from failure of cells to respond to normal cues to stop proliferating. Wnt signaling is also a critical pathway that drives the uncontrolled proliferation of many solid tumors in cancer stem cells (CSCs). Thus, therapies that down-regulate the activity of Wnt signaling, a fundamental pathway in CSCs, would be effective in the treatment of cancer. Such inhibitors would result in a long-term therapeutic benefit because the cells capable of repopulating the tumor would be killed. Most notably, there is clear evidence that colorectal cancer arises from mutations in the stem cell compartment, and it has been demonstrated that all major solid cancers in humans (e.g. melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer) have abnormal Wnt signaling. Thus, Wnt inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of most of the major solid cancers in humans.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
I. Definitions
The abbreviations used herein have their conventional meaning within the chemical and biological arts.
Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., —CH2O— is equivalent to —OCH2—.
The term “alkyl,” by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight (i.e. unbranched) or branched chain, or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. C1-C10 means one to ten carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers.
The term “alkylene” by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from an alkyl, as exemplified, but not limited, by —CH2CH2CH2CH2—. Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A “lower alkyl” or “lower alkylene” is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.
The term “heteroalkyl,” by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of at least one carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, P, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N, P, S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, —CH2—CH2—O—CH3, —CH2—CH2—NH—CH3, —CH2—CH2—N(CH3)—CH3, —CH2—S—CH2—CH3, —CH2—CH2, —S(O)—CH3, —CH2—CH2—S(O)2—CH3, —CH═CH—O—CH3, —Si(CH3)3, —CH2—CH═N—OCH3, —CH═CH—N(CH3)—CH3, O—CH3, —O—CH2—CH3, and —CN. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, —CH2—NH—OCH3 and —CH2—O—Si(CH3)3. Similarly, the term “heteroalkylene” by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, —CH2—CH2—S—CH2—CH2— and —CH2—S—CH2—CH2—NH—CH2—. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula —C(O)2R′— represents both —C(O)2R′— and —R′C(O)2—. As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom, such as —C(O)R′, —C(O)NR′, —NR′R″, —OR′, —SR′, and/or —SO2R′. Where “heteroalkyl” is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as —NR′R″ or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and —NR′R″ are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus, the term “heteroalkyl” should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as —NR′R″ or the like.
The terms “cycloalkyl” and “heterocycloalkyl”, by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of “alkyl” and “heteroalkyl”, respectively, which can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings) which are fused together or linked covalently. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1 (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1 piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like. A “cycloalkylene” and “heterocycloalkylene” refer to a divalent radical derived from cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl, respectively.
The terms “halo” or “halogen,” by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as “haloalkyl,” are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term “halo(C1-C4)alkyl” is mean to include, but not be limited to, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.
The term “aryl” means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic, hydrocarbon substituent which can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings) which are fused together or linked covalently. The term “heteroaryl” refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon or heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below. “Arylene” and “heteroarylene” refers to a divalent radical derived from a aryl and heteroaryl, respectively.
The term “oxo” as used herein means an oxygen that is double bonded to a carbon atom.
Each of the above terms (e.g., “alkyl,” “heteroalkyl,” “aryl” and “heteroaryl”), unless otherwise noted, are meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Where a substituent is R-substituted (e.g. an R16-substituted alkyl), the substituent may be substituted with one or more R groups as allowed by chemical valency rules where each R group is optionally different (e.g. an R16-substituted alkyl may include multiple R16 groups wherein each R16 group is optionally different). Certain examples of substituents for each type of radical are provided below.
Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often referred to as alkylenyl, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to: —OR′, ═O, ═NR′, ═N—OR′, —NR′R″, —SR′, -halogen, —SiR′R″R′″, —OC(O)R′, —C(O)R′, —CO2R′, —CONR′R″, —OC(O)NR′R″, —NR″C(O)R′, —NR′—C(O)NR″R′″, —NR″C(O)2R′, —NR—C(NR′R″R′″)═NR″″, —NR—C(NR′R″)═NR′″, —S(O)R′, —S(O)2R′, —S(O)2NR′R″, —NRSO2R′, —CN and —NO2 in a number ranging from zero to (2m′+1), where m′ is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R′, R″, R′″ and R″″ each preferably independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl (e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens), substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R′″ and R″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R′ and R″ are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, —NR′R″ is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term “alkyl” is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., —CF3 and —CH2CF3) and acyl (e.g., —C(O)CH3, —C(O)CF3, —C(O)CH2OCH3, and the like).
Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from, for example: halogen, —OR′, —NR′R″, —SR′, -halogen, —SiR′R″R′″, —OC(O)R′, —C(O)R′, —CO2R′, —CONR′R″, —OC(O)NR′R″, —NR″C(O)R′, —NR′—C(O)NR″R″″, —NR″C(O)2R′, —NR—C(NR′R″R′″)═NR″″, —NR—C(NR′R″)═NR′″, —S(O)R′, —S(O)2R′, —S(O)2NR′R″, —NRSO2R′, —CN and —NO2, —R′, —N3, —CH(Ph)2, fluoro(C1-C4)alkoxy, and fluoro(C1-C4)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R′, R″, R′″ and R″″ are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R′″ and R″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present.
Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally form a ring of the formula -T-C(O)—(CRR′)q—U—, wherein T and U are independently —NR—, —O—, —CRR′— or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A-(CH2)r—B—, wherein A and B are independently —CRR′—, —O—, —NR—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)2—, —S(O)2NR′— or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 4. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula —(CRR′)s—X′—(C″R′″)d—, where s and d are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X′ is —O—, —NR′—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)2—, or —S(O)2NR′—. The substituents R, R′, R″ and R′″ are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.
As used herein, the term “heteroatom” or “ring heteroatom” is meant to include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and silicon (Si).
A “substituent group,” as used herein, means a group selected from the following moieties:
(A) —OH, —NH2, —SH, —CN, —CF3, —NO2, oxo, halogen, unsubstituted alkyl, unsubstituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted aryl, unsubstituted heteroaryl, and

The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” is meant to include salts of the active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 1977, 66, 1-19). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.
Thus, the compounds of the present invention may exist as salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The present invention includes such salts. Examples of such salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, methanesulfonates, nitrates, maleates, acetates, citrates, fumarates, tartrates (eg (+)-tartrates, (−)-tartrates or mixtures thereof including racemic mixtures, succinates, benzoates and salts with amino acids such as glutamic acid. These salts may be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art.
The neutral forms of the compounds are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.
In addition to salt forms, the present invention provides compounds, which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.
Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.
Certain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, tautomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention do not include those which are known in the art to be too unstable to synthesize and/or isolate.
The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
The terms “a” or “an,” as used in herein means one or more. In addition, the phrase “substituted with a[n],” as used herein, means the specified group may be substituted with one or more of any or all of the named substituents. For example, where a group, such as an alkyl or heteroaryl group, is “substituted with an unsubstituted C1-C20 alkyl, or unsubstituted 2 to 20 membered heteroalkyl,” the group may contain one or more unsubstituted C1-C20 alkyls, and/or one or more unsubstituted 2 to 20 membered heteroalkyls.
The symbol denotes a point of attachment of a moiety to the remainder of a compound.
The phrase “effective amount” refers to an amount sufficient to attain the desired result. The phrase “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic result. Generally the therapeutic result is an objective or subjective improvement of a disease or condition, achieved by inducing or enhancing a physiological process, blocking or inhibiting a physiological process, or in general terms performing a biological function that helps in or contributes to the elimination or abatement of the disease or condition.
The terms “treat,” “treating” or “treatment,” and other grammatical equivalents as used herein, include alleviating, abating or ameliorating a disease or condition symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, ameliorating or preventing the underlying metabolic causes of symptoms, inhibiting the disease or condition, e.g., arresting the development of the disease or condition, relieving the disease or condition, causing regression of the disease or condition, relieving a condition caused by the disease or condition, or stopping the symptoms of the disease or condition, and prophylaxis. The terms further include achieving a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a patient at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease may not have been made.
As used herein, the term “cancer” refers to all types of cancer, neoplasm, or malignant tumors found in mammals, including leukemia, carcinomas and sarcomas. Exemplary cancers include cancer of the brain, breast, cervix, colon, head & neck, liver, kidney, lung, non-small cell lung, melanoma, mesothelioma, ovary, sarcoma, stomach, uterus and Medulloblastoma. Additional examples include, Hodgkin's Disease, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, multiple mycloma, neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma, primary thrombocytosis, primary macroglobulinemia, primary brain tumors, cancer, malignant pancreatic insulanoma, malignant carcinoid, urinary bladder cancer, premalignant skin lesions, testicular cancer, lymphomas, thyroid cancer, neuroblastoma, esophageal cancer, genitourinary tract cancer, malignant hypercalcemia, endometrial cancer, adrenal cortical cancer, neoplasms of the endocrine and exocrine pancreas, and prostate cancer.
The term “leukemia” refers broadly to progressive, malignant diseases of the blood-forming organs and is generally characterized by a distorted proliferation and development of leukocytes and their precursors in the blood and bone marrow. Leukemia is generally clinically classified on the basis of (1) the duration and character of the disease-acute or chronic; (2) the type of cell involved; myeloid (myelogenous), lymphoid (lymphogenous), or monocytic; and (3) the increase or non-increase in the number abnormal cells in the blood-leukemic or aleukemic (subleukemic). The P388 leukemia model is widely accepted as being predictive of in vivo anti-leukemic activity. It is believed that a compound that tests positive in the P388 assay will generally exhibit some level of anti-leukemic activity in vivo regardless of the type of leukemia being treated. Accordingly, the present invention includes a method of treating leukemia, and, preferably, a method of treating acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, aleukemic leukemia, a leukocythemic leukemia, basophylic leukemia, blast cell leukemia, bovine leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, leukemia cutis, embryonal leukemia, eosinophilic leukemia, Gross' leukemia, hairy-cell leukemia, hemoblastic leukemia, hemocytoblastic leukemia, histiocytic leukemia, stem cell leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia, leukopenic leukemia, lymphatic leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia, lymphogenous leukemia, lymphoid leukemia, lymphosarcoma cell leukemia, mast cell leukemia, megakaryocytic leukemia, micromyeloblastic leukemia, monocytic leukemia, myeloblastic leukemia, myelocytic leukemia, myeloid granulocytic leukemia, myelomonocytic leukemia, Naegeli leukemia, plasma cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, plasmacytic leukemia, promyelocytic leukemia, Rieder cell leukemia, Schilling's leukemia, stem cell leukemia, subleukemic leukemia, and undifferentiated cell leukemia.
The term “sarcoma” generally refers to a tumor which is made up of a substance like the embryonic connective tissue and is generally composed of closely packed cells embedded in a fibrillar or homogeneous substance. Sarcomas which can be treated with a combination of antineoplastic thiol-binding mitochondrial oxidant and an anticancer agent include a chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, lymphosarcoma, melanosarcoma, myxosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Abemethy's sarcoma, adipose sarcoma, liposarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, ameloblastic sarcoma, botryoid sarcoma, chloroma sarcoma, chorio carcinoma, embryonal sarcoma, Wilms' tumor sarcoma, endometrial sarcoma, stromal sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, fascial sarcoma, fibroblastic sarcoma, giant cell sarcoma, granulocytic sarcoma, Hodgkin's sarcoma, idiopathic multiple pigmented hemorrhagic sarcoma, immunoblastic sarcoma of B cells, lymphoma, immunoblastic sarcoma of T-cells, Jensen's sarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, Kupffer cell sarcoma, angiosarcoma, leukosarcoma, malignant mesenchymoma sarcoma, parosteal sarcoma, reticulocytic sarcoma, Rous sarcoma, serocystic sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and telangiectaltic sarcoma.
The term “melanoma” is taken to mean a tumor arising from the melanocytic system of the skin and other organs. Melanomas which can be treated with a combination of antineoplastic thiol-binding mitochondrial oxidant and an anticancer agent include, for example, acral-lentiginous melanoma, amelanotic melanoma, benign juvenile melanoma, Cloudman's melanoma, S91 melanoma, Harding-Passey melanoma, juvenile melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma, malignant melanoma, nodular melanoma, subungal melanoma, and superficial spreading melanoma.
The term “carcinoma” refers to a malignant new growth made up of epithelial cells tending to infiltrate the surrounding tissues and give rise to metastases.

Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an effective amount to achieve its intended purpose. Determination of the effective amounts is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.
In addition to the active ingredients, these pharmaceutical compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. The preparations formulated for oral administration may be in the form of tablets, dragees, capsules, or solutions.
Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipients, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC), and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP: povidone). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dye-stuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.
Pharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin, and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols (PEGs). In addition, stabilizers may be added.
Depending upon the particular condition, or disease state, to be treated or prevented, additional therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to treat or prevent that condition, may be administered together with the inhibitors of this invention. For example, chemotherapeutic agents or other anti-proliferative agents may be combined with the inhibitors of this invention to treat proliferative diseases and cancer. Examples of known chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, adriamycin, dexamethasone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, topotecan, taxol, interferons, and platinum derivatives.
Other examples of agents the compounds of this invention may also be combined with include, without limitation, anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids, TNF blockers, IL-1 RA, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and sulfasalazine; immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, rapamycin, mycophenolate mofetil, interferons, corticosteroids, cyclophophamide, azathioprine, and sulfasalazine; neurotrophic factors such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, MAO inhibitors, interferons, anti-convulsants, ion channel blockers, riluzole, and anti-Parkinsonian agents; agents for treating cardiovascular disease such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and statins; agents for treating liver disease such as corticosteroids, cholestyramine, interferons, and anti-viral agents; agents for treating blood disorders such as corticosteroids, anti-leukemic agents, and growth factors; agents for treating diabetes such as insulin, insulin analogues, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides, and insulin sensitizers; and agents for treating immunodeficiency disorders such as gamma globulin.
These additional agents may be administered separately, as part of a multiple dosage regimen, from the composition. Alternatively, these agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with the compound in a single composition.
Dosage forms (compositions) suitable for internal administration contain from about 1.0 milligram to about 5000 milligrams of active ingredient per unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions, the active ingredient may be present in an amount of about 0.5 to about 95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. Another convention for denoting the dosage form is in mg per meter squared (mg/m2) of body surface area (BSA). Typically, an adult will have approximately 1.75 m2 of BSA. Based on the body weight of the patient, the dosage may be administered in one or more doses several times per day or per week. Multiple dosage units may be required to achieve a therapeutically effective amount. For example, if the dosage form is 1000 mg, and the patient weighs 40 kg, one tablet or capsule will provide a dose of 25 mg per kg for that patient. It will provide a dose of only 12.5 mg/kg for a 80 kg patient.
By way of general guidance, for humans a dosage of as little as about 1 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight and up to about 10000 mg per kg of body weight is suitable as a therapeutically effective dose. Preferably, from about 5 mg/kg to about 2500 mg/kg of body weight is used. Other preferred doses range between 25 mg/kg to about 1000 mg/kg of body weight. However, a dosage of between about 2 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight to about 400 mg per kg of body weight is also suitable for treating some cancers.
Intravenously, the most preferred rates of administration can range from about 1 to about 1000 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily. The composition is generally given in one or more doses on a daily basis or from one to three times a week.
The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the exemplified embodiments, which are intended as illustrations of single aspects of the invention. Indeed, various modifications of the invention in addition to those described herein will become apparent to those having skill in the art from the foregoing description. Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the invention. Moreover, any one or more features of any embodiment of the invention may be combined with any one or more other features of any other embodiment of the invention, without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the compounds described above are equally applicable to the methods and pharmaceutical compositions described herein. References cited throughout this application are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety for all purposes, whether previously specifically incorporated or not.

Amines useful in the synthesis of compounds described herein are exemplified by the compounds shown following.
Synthesis of isoxazole containing compounds useful in the compositions and methods described herein can follow synthetic procedures known in the art and/or described herein. An exemplary synthetic pathway is provided in Scheme 2 following.
With reference to Scheme 2, phenylacetylene, optionally substituted with substituent R′, can react with a nitroacetic acid ester to provide the isoxazole. This [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is catalyzed by base (e.g., DBU) to form the nitronate which then undergoes cycloaddition. Removal of the esterified substitutent R is conveniently catalyzed by LiOH and THF in water to afford the phenylisoxazole acid. Subsequence reaction of the phenylisoxazole acid with amine, in the presence of suitable catalysts (e.g., EDC, HoBT and DIPEA) can afford isoxazoles useful in the compositions and methods described herein.

Screening Procedures
Drug Stocks and Dilutions. Compounds are prepared as 10 mM stocks for each compound in DMSO. Dilutions are prepared in a 96-well plate in DMSO. The stock dilutions are as follows: 10 mM, 3 mM, 1 mM, 300 μM, 100 μM, 30 μM, 10 μM, 3 μM, 1 μM, 300 nM, 100 nM, and 30 nM. Plates are then sealed and stored at −20 C.
Screening with STF293 and SW480STF. HEK STF293 cells are seeded at approximately 25,000-30,000 cells/well in a 96-well (100 uL volume). On the first day, Wnt3a-conditioned media (1:1) will be added along with diluted compounds (1:100). For example, for 100 ul of STF293 cells, 100 ul of Wnt3a-conditioned media and 2 ul of drug will be added to each well. The final concentrations should therefore be 100 μM, 30 μM, 10 μM, 3 μM, 1 μM, 300 nM, 100 nM, 30 nM, 10 nM, 3 nM, 1 nM, and 0.3 nM. On the second day, the media is removed and 75 ul of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) is added to each well. The plate will be shaken at 130 rpm for 15 minutes. For the Steady Glo assay, 45 ul of the lysis is removed and added to a white 96-well plate containing 45 uL/well of Steady Glo solution (Promega). For the Cell Titer assay, 25 ul of the lysis is transferred to a white 96-well plate containing 25 ul/well of Cell Titer solution (Promega). Both Steady Glo and Cell Titer assays will be read with a luminescence plate reader. When determining EC50, the Steady Glo values will be divided by the Cell Titer values to normalize for cell number and the resulting values plotted in a dose-response curve.
EXAMPLE 64
Activity in Reporter Assays
Experimental. All compounds were tested using the human cell line HEK STF293. This cell line carries a Wnt reporter (TCF/LEF1 promoter), which drives expression of the firefly luciferase protein. The level of Wnt activity is directly correlated with the level of luciferase activity (determined using a simple assay). Compounds that inhibit Wnt signaling by reducing luciferase activity in these two cell lines are further tested biochemically. Biochemical confirmation that compounds inhibit Wnt signaling is obtained by immunoblotting for beta-catenin in HEK STF293 cells and demonstrating that its levels are reduced.
Compounds were prepared as 10 mM stocks for each compound in DMSO. Dilutions were prepared in a 96-well plate in DMSO. The stock dilutions are as follows: 10 mM, 1 mM, 100 μM, 10 μM, 100 nM, and 10 nM. Plates were sealed and stored at −20 C.
HEK STF293 cells were seeded at approximately 25,000-30,000 cells/well in a 96-well (100 uL volume). On the first day, Wnt3a-conditioned media (1:1) were added along with diluted compounds (1:100). For example, for 100 ul of STF293 cells, 100 ul of Wnt3a-conditioned media and 2 ul of drug was added to each well. The final concentrations should therefore be 100 uM, 10 uM, 1 uM, 100 nM, 10 nM, and 1 nM. On the second day, the media is removed and 75 ul of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) is added to each well. The plate is shaken at 130 rpm for 15 minutes. For the Steady Glo assay, 45 ul of the lysis is removed and added to a white 96-well plate containing 45 uL/well of Steady Glo solution (Promega). For the Cell Titer assay, 25 ul of the lysis is transferred to a white 96-well plate containing 25 ul/well of Cell Titer solution (Promega). Both Steady Glo and Cell Titer assays were read with a luminescence plate reader. When determining EC50, the Steady Glo values were divided by the Cell Titer values to normalize for cell number.
The control CMV driven cell line assay was performed as recited above for the STF293 assay except that no Wnt3a-conditioned media was added to the plated cells and 1 ul of diluted compound was added instead of 2 ul.
Three concentrations were chosen based on the EC50 curves from the STF293 assay. From the original 10 mM stocks, the following dilutions were prepared in DMSO and stored at −20 C: 100 uM, 50 uM, and 10 uM.
HEK293 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at approximately 8.0×105 cells (2 mL per well). On the first day, Wnt3a-conditioned media (1:1) and compounds (1:100) were added to the plated cells. The final concentrations of compounds were 1 uM, 500 nM, and 100 nM. Vehicle (DMSO) and a Wnt3a-conditioned media plus Vehicle samples were also prepared as controls. Lysates were collected (with non-denaturing lysis buffer) after 24 hours incubation, and protein concentrations determined by Bradford Assay. Immunoblotting with an anti-beta-catenin antibody (equivalent amounts of protein/lane for each condition) were subsequently performed to determine beta-catenin levels.

Functional (Cell Proliferation) Assay
Experimental: Viability of colorectal (CRC) cells (SW480 cells, DLD-1 cells, HCT116 cells, and SW620 cells) in the presence of compounds was performed using the CellTiter-Glo® assay (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. This luminescence-based assay is sensitive (can measure down to 15 cells/well) and allows for multi-well formats. The assay measures the amount of ATP, which is proportional to the number of cells present in the culture. Briefly, cells are plated onto 96-well plates at low density in the presence of normal growth media and increasing concentration of compounds. The number of viable cells is then determined 48 and 72 hours later and compared with the vehicle treated controls.
Results. Certain compounds of the present invention showed anti-proliferation activity.
