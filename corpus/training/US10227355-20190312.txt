CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT/IN2016/050038, filed on Feb. 3, 2016, which claims priority to Indian patent application no. 304/DEL/2015, filed on Feb. 3, 2015, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to novel quinoline derivatives of formula (I). More particularly, the present invention relates to novel quinoline derivatives of formula (I) and preparation thereof.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Quinoline derivatives are one of the most important heterocyclic scaffolds, which occur in various natural products, bioactive compounds and pharmaceuticals, as well as a key part for the synthesis of antibacterial, Alzheimer agents, anticancer agents, and antimalarial drugs. Because of such significance much attention has been paid to the synthesis of substituted quinolines in organic chemistry since the late 1800s. In the last few decades, a number of methods have been developed for quinoline synthesis, but many of them rule out their general application due to harsh reaction condition and poor regioselectivity. For the direct synthesis of quinoline derivatives from their commercially available starting materials few reports are there, but in most of the case 2-substituted quinoline derivatives are reported. Synthesis of 3-functionalized quinoline derivatives are pharmaceutically very important, but so far, there are very few reports for the synthesis of 3-substituted quinoline derivatives and all them are multistep process.
Article titled, “N-Bromosuccinimide-Mediated Radical Cyclization of 3-Arylallyl Azides: Synthesis of 3-Substituted Quinolines” by Wang et. al in Adv. Synthesis & Catalysis (2015), 357(1), 221-226 reports that visible light irradiation of N-bromosuccinimide serves as an effective means to convert methyl 2-(azidomethyl)-3-arylpropenoates and 2-(azidomethyl)-3-arylacrylonitriles to the corresponding iminyl radicals via α-hydrogen abstraction and subsequent extrusion of dinitrogen. Thus formed iminyl radicals then undergo intramolecular ortho attack on the aryl ring, affording methyl quinoline-3-carboxylates and quinoline-3-carbonitriles respectively.

Article titled, “Carbonylations of alkenes with CO surrogates.” By L. Wu, Q. Liu, R. Jackstell, M. Beller in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 6310 reports Alkene carbonylation reactions are important for the production of value-added bulk and fine chemicals. Nowadays, all industrial carbonylation processes make use of highly toxic and flammable carbon monoxide. In fact, these properties impede the wider use of carbonylation reactions in industry and academia. Hence, performing carbonylations without the use of CO is highly desired and will contribute to the further advancement of sustainable chemistry. Although the use of carbon monoxide surrogates in alkene carbonylation reactions has been reported intermittently in the last 30 years, only recently has this area attracted significant interest. This review summarizes carbonylation reactions of alkenes using different carbon monoxide surrogates.

Horaks in J. Med. Chem., 1993, 36, 425 reports a process to prepare inhibitors of the lymphocyte protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. Using the known p56lck inhibitor 3,4-dihydroxy-alpha-cyanocinnamamide (4) as a lead compound, bicyclic analogues were designed as conformationally constrained mimetics in which the phenyl ring and vinyl side chain of the cinnamamide are locked into a coplanar orientation. Bicyclic analogues were prepared using the naphthalene, quinoline, isoquinoline, and 2-iminochromene ring systems and examined for their ability to inhibit autophosphorylation of immunopurified p56lck. The most potent analogues were methyl 7,8-dihydroxyisoquinoline-3-carboxylate (12) (IC50=0.2 microM) and 7,8-dihydroxyisoquinoline-3-carboxamide (13) (IC50=0.5 microM). Inhibition by 12 was not competitive with respect to ATP. These compounds may represent important new structural motifs for the development of p56lck inhibitors.

In the reaction, use of paraformaldehyde as a CO proxy leads to the quinoline products with more effective yield.
