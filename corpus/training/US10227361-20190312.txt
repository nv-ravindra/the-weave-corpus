BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The prevalence of airway diseases has increased in recent decades despite therapeutic advances. Among the airway diseases, asthma exacerbations and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are major causes of hospitalization. Both asthma and COPD involve chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract. Despite the presentation of similar symptoms, such as dyspnea, coughing, wheezing and expectoration, these airway diseases have different underlying pathophysiological processes. COPD is a term which refers to a large group of lung diseases characterized by obstruction of air flow that interferes with normal breathing. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the most important conditions that compose COPD (COPD—Chronic Bronchitis & Emphysema; Australian lung foundation, 2006). COPD involves chronic inflammation of the peripheral airways and lung parenchyma, which leads to progressive narrowing of the airways and shortness of breath. On the other hand Asthma is characterized by episodic airway obstruction and symptoms and usually starts early in life. The inflammation differs markedly between asthma and COPD, with different cells, mediators, consequences and, there is a difference in response to corticosteroids (Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2012; 67(11):1335-43). However, more recently it has become clear that severe asthma is much more similar to COPD, with similarities in the inflammation and sharing a poor response to corticosteroids (J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2013; 131(3):636-45). Interestingly, studies of molecular genetics are now showing that severe asthma and COPD share several gene polymorphisms (Comp Funct Genomics. 2012; 2012: 968267).
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major global health problem that is becoming prevalent, particularly in developing countries. It is one of the most common diseases in the world, with a lifetime risk estimated to be as high as 25%, and now equally affects both men and women (Nature Reviews 2013; 12: 543-559)
Current forms of therapy for COPD are relatively ineffective, as there are no drugs available that considerably reduce disease progression or mortality or have a substantial effect on exacerbations, which are one of the most common causes of hospital admissions.
Long acting bronchodilators are the mainstay of current COPD therapy. There have been several advances in the development of β2-adrenergic receptor agonists and muscarinic receptor antagonists that only need to be administered once a day. Moreover, long acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists (LAMAs) have additive effects on bronchodilation and in the improvement of symptoms, which has led to the development of LABA-LAMA combination inhalers. However, although these drugs produce effective bronchodilation, they fail to treat the underlying inflammatory disease in patients with COPD.
Alternatively or additional to bronchodilators, oral or inhaled corticosteroids could also be used as COPD therapy. But corticosteroids have limitations as long term oral corticosteroid therapy is not recommended and inhaled corticosteroids are known to be associated with increased risk of pneumonia in patients. (www.bcguidelines.ca) Moreover, Inhaled corticosteroids are found largely ineffective in significant number of COPD patients as an anti-inflammatory therapy in COPD (Ann Fam Med. 2006; 4(3):253-62). Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE-4 inhibitors) have recently been shown to document clinical efficacy in COPD, although their utility is hampered by class related side effects. (International Journal of COPD 2007; 2(2): 121-129)
With better understanding of the pathophysiology of COPD disease process and recognition of inflammation as an important feature, it is anticipated that disease modifying therapy for COPD targeting underlying inflammation will prove effective the way it has been successful in the treatment of other chronic inflammatory conditions like RA.
Many kinases are involved in the regulation of proinflammatory transcription factors and inflammatory genes. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family includes the p38 kinases, which consists of highly conserved proline-directed serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated in response to inflammatory signals. The p38 MAPK pathway, which is activated by cellular stress, regulates the expression of many inflammatory genes that are involved in COPD (Nature Reviews 2013; 12: 543-559). Proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and environmental stress activates p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) by phosphorylation, which in turn activates p38 MAPK signaling pathway. p38 is involved in the inflammatory responses induced by different stimuli through activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, posttranslational regulation of these genes, and activation of inflammatory cell migration. Therefore, p38 inhibitors present a potentially attractive treatment target for the chronic inflammatory conditions including COPD. Of the four isoforms known so far, p38 alpha is the most abundant in inflammatory cells and has been the most studied.
Over the past two decades, p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) has been the subject of intense multidisciplinary research. p38 MAPK inhibitors have been shown to be efficacious in several disease models, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and stroke. Recent studies support a role for p38 MAPK in the development, maintenance, and/or exacerbation of a number of pulmonary diseases, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is now an abundant literature which demonstrates that p38 MAPK is activated in chronic inflammatory conditions and that its activation results in the elaboration and release of further proinflammatory cytokines (Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2008; 17(10):1411-1425).
Though orally administered small molecule inhibitors targeted to P38 MAPK have proved to be effective in reducing various parameters of inflammation in cells and tissues obtained from patients with COPD in initial clinical studies, the major obstacle hindering the definition and exploitation of the potential utilities of p38 MAPK inhibitors in the treatment of human chronic inflammatory diseases has been the toxicity observed in patients. This has been sufficiently severe to result in the withdrawal from clinical development of many of the compounds progressed. Presently, none of them is yet approved anywhere in the world because one or the other problems associated with selected molecules such as toxicity or selectivity (Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2008; 17(10):1411-1425 & Chest 2011; 139(6): 1470-1479).
For example, pyridinyl imidazole based p38 MAPK inhibitors into clinical trials were found to be associated with unacceptable safety profile. The side effects reported both preclinically and clinically for other similar p38 MAPK inhibitors include hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, light headedness and other CNS toxicities, skin rash, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, and infections. Some question of selectivity has also arisen for these molecules. Similarly, BIRB-796, a noncompetitive p38 MAPK inhibitor for ATP was evaluated for its activity but it has been withdrawn from Phase II clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis, possibly because of liver enzyme elevations. (Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2008; 17(10):1411-1425 & Chest 2011; 139(6): 1470-1479).
A Phase II study with another p38 MAPK inhibitor Vx-745, in rheumatoid arthritis patients displayed significant clinical benefit compared to placebo at the single low dose tested. However, it was also discontinued because of undisclosed CNS toxicity in dogs during a 6-month safety study. (Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2008; 17(10): 1411-1425)
To overcome these problems of toxicity and selectivity of the target associated with known p38 MAPK inhibitors, some alternative strategies were designed. One of them was to design the treatment approaches wherein p38 kinase inhibitor is dosed directly to the inflamed organ.
Other strategies include developing newer generation p38 MAPK inhibitors with improved selectivity and lesser side effect profile. For example, PH-797804 and Losmapimod have been shown to be well tolerated in clinical studies when treated up to 12-24 weeks. (Thorax. 2013 August; 68(8): 738-45 & J Clin Pharmacol. 2012 March; 52(3): 416-24)
There remains a need to identify and develop new p38 MAPK inhibitors which provides desired therapeutic potential along with improved pharmacokinetic profile and/or lesser side effects.
WO200214321 discloses polycyclic imidazole derivatives as STAT-6 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer or to sensitize cancer cells to other anti-cancer treatment.
GB2232666 and GB2211186 disclose imidazobenzothiazoles as benzodiazepine inverse agonist for the treatment of memory problem, obesity or can be used as minor tranquilizers.
Present invention provides novel fused imidazobenzothiazole derivatives as p38 MAPK inhibitors, which have demonstrated desired efficacy and safety profile.

In which the substituents are as defined in connection with general formula (I) and schemes 1-6.
Synthesis of various compounds of formula Ia-Ih, where R is L-N(R5)C(O)N(R5)-A is shown in scheme 1, wherein L is defined in the scheme and R5 is H. The compounds of formula Ia is synthesized from the reaction of compound of formula Iaa or Iba, separately, with compounds of formula of IIa or IIa′ in the presence of a suitable base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) and suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or ethyl acetate (EtOAc) at reflux temperature. Alternatively, compounds of formula Ia can be synthesized by the reaction of other suitable carbamate using conventional synthetic methods. Compound of formula IIa is synthesized from reaction of suitable substituted amine (A-NH2) with trichloroethylchloroformate in the presence of aqueous basic solution such as sodium bicarbonate/potassium bicarbonate in solvent such as ethylacetate (EtOAc) at room temperature (RT) (J. Med. Chem., 2011, 54, 7797 or WO 2007/091152). Compound of formula IIa′ is synthesized from reaction of suitable phenyl chloroformate with amine (A-NH2) using the similar condition as described for synthesis of compound of formula IIa. The compound of formula Ib is prepared from the reduction of compound of formula Ia with suitable reducing agent like metalborohydride such as lithium borohydride (LiBH4) or lithium aluminium hydride (LAH) or Vitride® in the presence of suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) in an inert atmosphere at reflux or lower temperature, usually at reflux temperature. Compound of formula Ic is synthesized from the compound of formula Ib with suitable chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride in the presence of suitable solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM) at a reflux temperature or lower. Compounds of formula Id is synthesized from the reaction of compound of formula Ic with appropriate R3H. The reaction is being carried out in a suitable solvent or mixture of solvent such as THF, dimethyl formamide (DMF) at room temperature (RT) to the reflux temperature depending on the nature of R3H. Oxidation of compounds of formula Id, when R3 is a sulfur (S) containing group, can provide corresponding mono- or dioxide (S(O)m, where m is 1 or 2) compounds of formula Id. Compound of formula Ie and Ig can be prepared by hydrolysis of compound of formula Ia. The hydrolysis reaction is being done with suitable base such as lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH.H2O) using suitable solvent such as methanol (MeOH) at a temperature between RT and reflux, usually at RT.

Biological Testing
Biological Example 1: In-Vitro Studies
Inhibition of p38 Alpha MAPK Activity: Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Kinase Standard Assay (TR-FRET Assay)
Compounds of present invention at various concentrations were premixed with DMSO. The experiment was initiated by mixing 0.5% 1.0% DMSO as vehicle/compounds with purified recombinant human p38 alpha MAPK (Millipore, USA) in the wells and 15 min incubation at RT. Thereafter, 30 nM of Biotinylated GST-ATF2 (Activation Transcription Factor2) and 100 μM of ATP were added in to the wells containing reaction mixture, followed by reincubation for 60 minutes at RT. Reaction was terminated by addition of 10 mM of EDTA and detection reagent containing anti-phosphothreonine ATF2 antibody (Perkin Elmer, USA) labelled with europium chelate and APC (Allophycocyanin) labeled streptavidin, into the reaction mixture which was further incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. The degree of phosphorylation of the substrate (GST-ATF2) was measured using Envision multimode reader (Perkin Elmer). Percentage inhibition of p38 kinase activity was calculated by determining ratio of specific europium 665 nm energy transfer signal to reference 615 nm signal. Results are summarized in the table 2.

Biological Example 2: In Vivo Studies
In Vivo Efficacy Evaluation of Compounds in Animal Model of Airway Inflammation:
The tobacco smoke induced airway inflammation model is used for in vivo efficacy of compound. Many investigators have used acute tobacco smoke (TS) exposure in rodents as models of airway inflammation for quick screening of anti-inflammatory therapies for COPD (J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2008; 324(3):921-9; J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2010; 332(3):764-75; Journal of Inflammation 2013, 10(Suppl 1):31 and Eur Respir J Suppl 2006; 663s:3850). Given its position as predominant cause of COPD, animal models using TS exposure would appear to be the logical choice for investigation (Respir Res. 2004; 2; 5:18).
A: Efficacy Studies in Acute Mouse Model of Airway Inflammation
Mice were exposed to tobacco smoke (TS) in an acrylic chamber. Animals were exposed to TS from 8, 12, 16 cigarettes on day1, day2, day 3 respectively. From day 4 onwards till day 11, animals were exposed to TS from 20 cigarettes per day. On 11 days of exposure of mice to TS, significant inflammatory cell recruitment, predominantly neutrophils, to lungs was observed as compared to air exposed control mice (BALF neutrophil levels, nil in air control group vs 93.8±11.7*103 cells/animal in smoke exposed vehicle group).
Lung delivery of test compound was achieved by whole body aerosol exposure for 25 minutes in a chamber. Mice were divided in different dose groups and exposed in a chamber for 25 minutes with vehicle or Compound No. 22 (0.3 mg/ml) or Compound No. 22 (3 mg/ml)) or Compound No. 31 (0.3 mg/ml) or Compound No. 31 (1.0 mg/ml). A total quantity of 3.5 ml of either vehicle or test compound formulation (suspension formulation with D90<5μ, with Malvern Mastersizer®) was nebulized in a chamber to respective groups over 25 mins period. Test compounds were administered 2 hr prior to TS exposure from day 6 to day 11. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 24 hr post last TS exposure.
Trachea of animal was cannulated using catheter. Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) was used as lavage fluid. A volume of 0.5 ml was gently instilled and withdrawn and collected in microcentrifuge tube placed on ice. This procedure was repeated further 2 times.
Lavage fluid was separated from cells by centrifugation and supernatant separated. The cell pallet was resuspended in known volume of PBS. Cells in aliquot were stained using Turk solution and total cell numbers were calculated by counting Turk stained aliquot under microscope using haemocytometer.
The residual cell suspension was resuspended and slides prepared using cyto centrifuge technique (Cytospin 4, Thermo Shandon). The slides were then fixed with methanol, air dried and stained with May Grunwald Giemsa stain. Up to 300 cells were counted and differentiated using standard morphometric techniques under light microscopy.
All results are presented at individual data for each animal and mean value calculated for each group. Percentage inhibition for the neutrophil was calculated for Compound No. 22 & 31 treatment group against vehicle group. Results are summarized herein below:

Observation: It was observed that compounds of present invention were found effective in inhibition of neutrophil influx, an index of pulmonary inflammation. These results indicate that compounds of present invention possess pulmonary anti-inflammatory activity.
B. (I) Efficacy Studies in Acute Guinea Pig Model of Airway Inflammation
Guinea pigs were exposed to tobacco smoke (TS) in an acrylic chamber. Animals were exposed to TS from 5, 10, 15 cigarettes on day 1, day 2, day 3 respectively. From day 4 onwards till day 11, animals were exposed to TS from 15 cigarettes per day. On 11 days of exposure of guinea pig to TS, significant inflammatory cell recruitment, predominantly neutrophils, to lungs was observed as compared to air exposed control guinea pig (BALF neutrophil levels, 0.23±0.052*106 cells/animal in air control group vs 3.5±0.62*106 cells/animal in smoke exposed vehicle group).
Lung delivery of test compound was achieved by whole body aerosol exposure for 75 minutes in a chamber. Guinea pig were divided in different dose groups and exposed in a chamber for 75 minutes with vehicle or Compound No. 31 (6 mg/ml). A total quantity of 7.0 ml of either vehicle or test compound formulation (suspension formulation with D90<5μ, with Malvern Mastersizer®) was nebulized in chambers to respective groups over 75 mins period. Test compound was administered 2 hr prior to TS exposure from day 6 to day 11. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 24 hr post last TS exposure.
Trachea of animal was cannulated using catheter. Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) was used as lavage fluid. A volume of 5.0 ml was gently instilled and withdrawn and collected in microcentrifuge tube placed on ice. This procedure was repeated further 5 times.
Lavage fluid was separated from cells by centrifugation and supernatant separated. The cell pallet was resuspended in known volume of PBS. Cells in aliquot were stained using Turk solution and total cell numbers were calculated by counting Turk stained aliquot under microscope using haemocytometer.
The residual cell suspension was resuspended and slides prepared using cyto centrifuge technique (Cytospin 4, Thermo Shandon). The slides were then fixed with methanol, air dried and stained with May Grunwald Giemsa stain. Up to 300 cells were counted and differentiated using standard morphometric techniques under light microscopy.
All results are presented at individual data for each animal and mean value calculated for each group. Percentage inhibition for the neutrophil was calculated for Compound No 31 treatment group against vehicle group. Results are summarized herein below:

(II) Efficacy Studies in Chronic Model of COPD in Guinea Pigs
Guinea pigs were exposed to tobacco smoke (TS) and LPS in an acrylic chamber. Exposure to TS and LPS is given in the manner as illustrated in FIG. 3 in a week for a total of 18 weeks.
Lung delivery of test material was achieved by whole body aerosol exposure for 75 minutes in a chamber. Guinea pig were divided in different dose groups and exposed to vehicle or Compound No. 31 (2 mg/ml). A total quantity of 7.0 ml of either vehicle or Compound No. 31 (suspension formulation with D90<5μ, with Malvern Mastersizer®) was nebulized in chambers to respective groups over 75 mins period. Compound No 31 was administered 2 hr prior to TS/LPS exposure once daily from week 9 to week 18. Control animals were exposed to room air instead of TS and PBS instead of LPS. Lung function and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for each animal was performed 24 hr post last TS exposure.
Lung function assessment in anesthetized and tracheotomized animal was carried out using PFT maneuvers (BUXCO, USA) for determination of various parameters such as Functional Residual Capacity (FRC), Residual volume (RV), Pressure volume and flow volume relationships.
Trachea of animal was cannulated using catheter. Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) was used as lavage fluid. A volume of 5.0 ml was gently instilled and withdrawn and collected in microcentrifuge tube placed on ice. This procedure was repeated further 5 times.
Lavage fluid was separated from cells by centrifugation and supernatant separated. The cell pallet was resuspended in known volume of PBS. Cells in aliquot were stained using Turk solution and total cell numbers were calculated by counting Turk stained aliquot under microscope using haemocytometer.
The residual cell suspension was resuspended and slides prepared using cyto centrifuge technique (Cytospin 4, Thermo Shandon). The slides were then fixed with methanol, air dried and stained with May Grunwald Giemsa stain. Up to 300 cells were counted and differentiated using standard morphometric techniques under light microscopy.
After collection of BALF lung was fixed under constant pressure using neutral buffered formaline, which is to be used further for histopathological analysis. Hematoxylin and eosin stained slides were used for assessment of lung inflammatory cell influx and alveolar & epithelial inflammatory changes. Periodic acid-Schiff-diastase stained slides were used to evaluate mucin secreting cells and Masson's trichome stained slides were used for assessment of collagen fibers in parenchyma.
All results are presented at individual data for each animal and mean value calculated for each group. Percentage inhibition for the neutrophil was calculated for compound no 31 group against vehicle group. Results are summarized herein below:
