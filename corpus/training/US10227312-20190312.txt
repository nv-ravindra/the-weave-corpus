FIELD
Described herein are compounds, methods of making such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and medicaments containing such compounds, and methods of using such compounds to treat or prevent diseases or conditions associated with the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (GCS).
BACKGROUND
Glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) is a key enzyme which catalyzes the initial glycosylation step in the biosynthesis of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids (GSLs) namely via the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) to ceramide to form glucosylceramide. GCS is a transmembrane, type III integral protein localized in the cis/medial golgi. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are believed to be integral in many cell membrane events, including cellular interactions, signaling, and trafficking. Synthesis of GSL structures has been shown (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 1999, 96(16), 9142-9147) to be essential for embryonic development and for the differentiation of some tissues. Ceramide plays a central role in sphingolipid metabolism, and downregulation of GCS activity has been shown to have marked effects on the sphingolipid pattern with diminished expression of glycosphingolipids. Sphingolipids have a role in physiological as well as pathological cardiovascular conditions. In particular, sphingolipids and their regulating enzymes appear to play a role in adaptive responses to chronic hypoxia in the neonatal rat heart (Prostaglandins & Other Lipid Mediators 2005, 78(1-4), 249-263).
GCS inhibitors have been proposed for the treatment of a variety of diseases (see, for example, WO2005068426). Such diseases include glycolipid storage diseases (e.g., Tay Sachs, Sandhoffs, GM1 gangliosidosis, Niemanns-Pick, and Fabry diseases), diseases associated with glycolipid accumulation (e.g., Gaucher disease), diseases that cause renal hypertrophy or hyperplasia such as diabetic nephropathy, diseases that cause hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia, cancers in which glycolipid synthesis is abnormal, infectious diseases caused by organisms which use cell surface glycolipids as receptors, infectious diseases in which synthesis of glucosylceramide is essential or important, diseases in which excessive glycolipid synthesis occurs (e.g., atherosclerosis, polycystic kidney disease, and renal hypertrophy), neuronal disorders, neuronal injury, inflammatory diseases or disorders associated with macrophage recruitment and activation (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, asthma and sepsis), pain (see WO2008011483—neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, headache pain, somatic pain, visceral pain, referred pain), cognitive disorders (see WO2008/109286—agnosia; amnesia; aphasia; an apraxia; delirium; dementia including AIDS dementia complex, Binswanger's disease, dementia with Lewy Bodies, frontotemporal dementia, mild cognitive impairment, multi-infarct dementia, Pick's disease, semantic dementia, senile dementia, and vascular dementia; and learning disorders including Asperger's syndrome, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Rett syndrome), neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer's disease, corticobasal degeneration, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, normal pressure hydrocephalus, organic chronic brain syndrome, Parkinson's disease, Pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and senile dementia (Alzheimer type), glomerular disease, and diabetes mellitus and obesity (see WO 2006053043)). Renal hypertrophy induced by diabetes is associated with enhanced synthesis of glycosphingolipids such as glucosylceramide and ganglioside GM3, which accumulate in the kidney of rats (J. Clin. Invest. 1993, 91(3), 797).
It has been shown that overexpression of GCS is implicated in multi-drug resistance and disrupts ceramide-induced apoptosis. For example, Turzanski et al. (Experimental Hematology 2005, 33(1), 62-72) have shown that ceramide induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and that P-glycoprotein (p-gp) confers resistance to ceramide-induced apoptosis, with modulation of the ceramide-glucosylceramide pathway making a marked contribution to this resistance in TF-I cells. Thus, GCS inhibitors can be useful for treatment of proliferative disorders (such as cancer) by inducing apoptosis in diseased cells.
Sandhoff (or type 2 GM2 gangliosidosis) is caused by a deficiency in β-hexosaminidase A and B activity which leads to an accumulation of the ganglioside GM2 and other glycolipids causing damage to the central nervous system and eventually is lethal (PLoS One 2011, 6(6), e21758). Tay-Sachs disease (or GM2 gangliosidosis) is caused by a deficiency in β-hexosaminidase A which lead to an accumulation of gangliosides in the brain's nerve cells eventually leading to their premature death. Intravenous injection of the missing enzyme(s) is not a viable option as of the enzymes does cross the blood-brain barrier (Genetics in Medicine 2009, 1(6), 425). Glucosylceramide synthase is a key enzyme in the synthesis of glucosylceramide and other glycosphingolipids. Its inhibition can decrease the amount of the glycosphingolipids which accumulate in Sandhoff disease.
Fabry disease is caused by loss of activity of the lysosomal hydrolase α-galactosidase which leads to an accumulation of glycosphingolipids (particularly globotriaosylceramide) causing pain, renal disease and failure, cerebral vascular disease, and myocardial infarction (Kidney International 2000, 57, 446). One treatment strategy is to provide the defective enzyme to the patient; however, enzyme replacement therapy can only slow the progression of the disease and is not a cure. An alternative or complementary strategy is one where glucosylceramide synthase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of glycosphingolipids, is inhibited with a small molecule thus decreasing the amount of globotriaosylceramide and other glucosylceramide-based lipids that need to be broken down by hydrolase α-galactosidase.
Gaucher disease is caused by a defect in the enzyme lysosomal glucocerebrosidase which is responsible for catalyzing the breakdown of glucosylceramide which then accumulates in tissues of affected people (J. Org. Chem. 2007, 72(4), 1088) causing liver malfunction, skeletal disorders, painful bone lesions, hypersplenism, pancytopenia, and neurological symptoms (convulsions, hypertonia, mental retardation, apnea, dementia, and ocular muscle apraxia). One treatment strategy is to provide the defective enzyme to the patient; however, enzyme replacement therapy is not suitable for all patients and does not address the neurological manifestations of the disease for those with type 2 and type 3. An alternative or complementary strategy is one where glucosylceramide synthase is inhibited with small molecules thus decreasing the amount of glucosylceramide that needs to be broken down by glucocerebrosidase.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NALD) is a disease where fat accumulates in the liver of people who drink little or no alcohol and results in inflammation and scarring of the liver which can progress to liver failure. Inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase in ob/ob mice lowered glucose levels, lowered liver/body weight ratio, decreased the accumulation of triglycerides, and prevented and reversed steatosis (Hepatology 2009, 50(1), 85-93). Thus GCS inhibitors are useful for the prevention and treatment of NALD.
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disease characterized by noncancerous cysts which are filled with fluid and cause the kidneys to enlarge which can result in a decrease in quality of life (e.g., headaches, high blood pressure, back and side pain, colon problems, mitral valve prolapsed, and kidney stones) and can be life-threatening (e.g., kidney failure, aneurysm in the brain, and high blood pressure which can lead to heart disease and stroke). PKD can also damage the liver, spleen, pancreas, vasculature, testes, seminal vesicles, and intestines. Glucosylceramide and ganglioside GM3 levels in the kidney are higher than in normal tissue (Nat Med 2010, 16(7), 788). Thus, blocking the synthesis of glucosylceramide with an inhibitor of GCS can be useful in the treatment of PKD to reduce new cyst formation (partial or complete inhibition of cystogenesis), reduce cyst mass, reduce the size and number of cysts, and/or reduce the severity of the symptoms associated. All current treatments for PKD address symptoms and do not treat the underlying cause of the disease (Nat Med 2010, 16(7), 788).

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES
The following describes ways in which the compounds described herein were tested to measure in vitro activity in enzymatic and cell-based assays. A person of ordinary skill in the art would know that variations in the assay conditions could be used to determine the activity of the compounds.
Assay 1: GCS Enzymatic Assay
This assay was modified based on the study by Larsen et al. (J. Lipid Res. 2011, 53, 282). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell lysate was prepared using M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermal Scientific) in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein concentration was determined using BCA assay kit (Pierce). Sixty micrograms of MDCK cell lysate was incubated with various concentrations of a compound described herein from 0.001 μM-10 μM, respectively, or as indicated in Table 2, in 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM NAD, 100 μM UDP-glucose, 10 μM C6-NBD-Ceramide (Matreya LLC, Pleasant Gap, Pa.), 35 μM dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and 5 μM sulfatide (Sigma) in a final reaction volume of 100 μL at 37° C. for 1 hour. 0.1% DMSO was used as mock treatment or control. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μL acetonitrile solution and subjected to LC/MS analysis.
The quantitative analysis of NBD-Ceramide and glucosylceramide was performed on a Shimadzu ultra-fast liquid chromatography (Shimadzu, Japan) coupled with API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Concord, Ontario, Canada). Sample separation was conducted on a Waters Xbridge™ BEH130 C18, 100 mm×4.6 mm i.d, 3.5 μm (Milford, Mass., USA). The mobile phase consisted of water and acetonitrile supplemented with 0.1% formic acid (v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The initial mobile phase was 20% acetonitrile and was ramped in a linear fashion to 50% acetonitrile in 0.4 min. From 0.4 to 1.5 min, the gradient was ramped to 98% acetonitrile, and then was held at 100% until 8.0 min. Acetonitrile was reset to 20% in 1.5 min, and maintained until 10.0 min. The total run time was 10.0 min. The MS/MS detection was performed in ESI positive mode. The mass transition of NBD-Ceramide was m/z 576.36→558.40 under the collision energy of 15 V, and the mass transition of glucosylceramide was m/z 738.35-558.40 under 21V collision energy. The cell lysate was diluted with equal volume of acetonitrile. Aliquots of 50 μL diluted samples were added to 1.5 mL tubes, and 100 μL of acetonitrile containing internal standard (100 ng/mL tolbutamide) were added for protein precipitation. The mixture were vortexed and then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min. 70 μL of supernatant were mixed with 140 μL of H2O and the final solution were injected for LC/MS/MS analysis and IC50's and/or percent inhibitions calculated.
Assay 2: K562 Cell-Based Assay
This assay was modified based on the study by Gupta et al. (J. Lipid Res. 2010, 51, 866).

Then 100 μL of RPMI-1640 medium containing 110 μM of NBD-Ceramide, 11% BSA, 5% FBS, and corresponding concentration of a compound described herein was added into each well and mixed. Cells were incubated for additional 0.5 h at 37° C., followed by washing the cells with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) twice with centrifugation and resuspended with 50 μL cold PBS+1% Triton X-100. The cell lysate was sonicated for 15 min before adding equal volume of methanol for LCMS analysis. A small aliquot of cell lysate was used to determine protein concentration by BCA assay kit. The HPLC equipment and methods used in Assay 1 were used in this assay as well and IC50's were calculated.
Assay 3: NCI/ADR-Res Cell-Based Assay

Sandhoff Disease Mouse Model
The murine model of Sandhoff disease is a knock out (KO) of the HEXB gene, which codes for beta-hexosaminidase in mice, as it does in humans. This KO mouse displays a phenotype closely resembling that seen in humans, although at a more advanced age, compared to humans. At ˜3 months of age, the animals develop tremor and increased limb tone, which is worse in the hind legs. These manifestations become progressively more severe until 4-5 months of age, when the animals become moribund and rapidly lose weight. The motor phenotype has been quantified by activity monitor, bar-crossing, and inverted screen tests (Jayakumar M et al Blood 2001, 97, 327-329; Cachon-Gonzalez et al PNAS 2006, 103(27), 1037-10378). Histologically, the mouse neurons appear to be distended by lysosomal storage material, and signs of neuroinflammation are present. Biochemically, levels of beta-hexosaminidase are absent, and accumulations of gangliosides GM2, GA2, as well as sialic acid, can be demonstrated (Cachon-Gonzalez et al 2006; Arthur et al Neurochem Res 2013, DOI 10.1007/s11064-013-0992-5).
To evaluate the potential efficacy of different compounds described herein in Sandhoff disease, homozygous male mice are mated with heterozygous females. All pups (approximately 50% KO and 50% het) in a litter are treated by daily IP or SC injection with the same test (or control) article for 14 days, beginning at 3 days old. The chosen route of administration is determined based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of the compound to be tested. At the end of the dosing period, pups are deeply anesthetized using isoflurane through nose cones (4% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance), blood is collected by cardiac puncture method, then the mice are euthanized. Brains and livers are collected and snap frozen. These tissues are used for analysis of experimental endpoints (GM2 and sialic acid in brain, GA2 and sialic acid in liver). An additional tissue sample (tail tip or toe) is collected and snap frozen, then sent for genotyping.
If tested compounds are found which have a marked effect on the experimental endpoints, an additional experiment is performed looking at effects on activity, inverted screen, and bar crossing tests, as well as average survival time, compared to vehicle-treated mice.
Polycystic Kidney Disease Mouse Model
To jck mice is administered a compound described herein ad libitum in food (standard chow) from 26-64 days of age. Control jck mice are fed a control diet from 26-64 days of age. At 63 days of age, the animals are transferred to metabolic cages for 24 hour urine collection. At 64 days of age, animals are sacrificed, weighed, and blood is collected by heart puncture for serum isolation. Kidneys are isolated, bisected, and weighed and half of each kidney is fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight for paraffin embedding and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Kidney weight to body weight ratio is used to determine activity of the compound. Cyst volume is measured by quantitating the percentage of cystic area in histological sections of kidneys from the treated and control animals and multiplied by the kidney/body weight ratio. Kidney function is assessed by measuring blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in serum samples derived from animals at sacrifice. BUN levels are elevated in untreated controls while the treated animals demonstrated a significant reduction of BUN levels.

It should be understood, however, that the description and the specific examples, while indicating specific embodiments, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the present description will become apparent from this detailed description.
