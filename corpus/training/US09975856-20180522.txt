FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates to methods of making an estrogen receptor modulating compound, (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The estrogen receptor is a critical driver in breast cancer (Di Cosimo, S. & Baselga, J. (2010) Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol). Since about 60-70% of breast cancer (BC) is estrogen receptor positive (ER+), modulation of estrogen activity and/or synthesis is the main therapeutic strategy in the treatment of ER+BC. Effective hormonal therapies are used across many lines of therapy to decrease estrogen/ligand (ovarian suppression, aromatase inhibitors). Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) bind to ER, downregulate ER levels and antagonize ER transcriptional activity. Selective Estrogen Receptor Degraders (SERDs) bind to ER and degrade ER. Many breast cancer patients relapse or develop resistance in their tumors, which are often still dependent on the ER.
The N-methyl-D-glucamine salt of (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-Chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid (GDC-0810, ARN-810, Seragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Genentech Inc., CAS Registry Number 1365888-06-7) is an oral, non-steroidal, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) antagonist and selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that competes with estrogens for binding to the estrogen receptor with low nanomolar potency (U.S. Pat. No. 8,299,112; U.S. Pat. No. 8,455,534; Lai et al (2015) J. Med. Chem. 58:4888-4904). A Phase I study evaluated the oral selective estrogen receptor degrader GDC-0810 (ARN-810) in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) HER2−, advanced/metastatic breast cancer (Zhou et al, “Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader (SERD) activity in ESR1 mutant models”, AACR Poster #1864; Joseph et al, “Discovery of GDC-0810 a novel, non-steroidal selective estrogen receptor degrader with robust activity in pre-clinical models of endocrine-resistant breast cancer”, AACR Poster #5053; Dickler M N, et al (2015) AACR Annual Meeting, Clinical Trials of New Drugs in Breast Cancer, Apr. 20, 2015, Abstract CT231). GDC-0810 has demonstrated tumor regression in tamoxifen sensitive and resistant BC models.
In contrast to first generation ER antagonists, such as tamoxifen, GDC-0810 fully antagonizes the response of ER to estrogens and induces proteosomal degradation of ER-α in breast cancer cell lines. These bipartite activities result in full antagonism of ER-target gene transcription in breast cancer cell lines in vitro. The result is robust inhibition of ER signaling, and in turn, inhibition of breast tumor cell proliferation. Unlike fulvestrant, which is also an ER antagonist and degrader, GDC-0810 has a nonsteroidal chemical backbone and displays oral bioavailability.

DEFINITIONS
The term “chiral” refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term “achiral” refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.
The term “stereoisomers” refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.
“Diastereomer” refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities.
Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.
“Enantiomers” refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.
Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., “Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds”, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers (stereocenters), and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (−) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (−) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms “racemic mixture” and “racemate” refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.
The term “tautomer” or “tautomeric form” refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.
The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate “mesylate”, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1′-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and/or one or more counter ion.
If the compound of the invention is a base, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, methanesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, such as citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.
If the compound of the invention is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or the like. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include, but are not limited to, organic salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and arginine, ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic amines, such as piperidine, morpholine and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum and lithium.
A “solvate” refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. The term “hydrate” refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.
The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate “mesylate”, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1′-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and/or one or more counter ion.
Preparation of (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-Chloro-4-Fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-Indazol-5-Yl)but-1-En-1-Yl)Phenyl)Acrylic Acid
The present invention includes processes, methods, reagents, and intermediates for the synthesis of the estrogen receptor modulating compound, (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid I (CAS Registry Number 1365888-06-7), also known as GDC-0810, ARN810, or (E)-3-[4-[(E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl]phenyl]-2-propenoic acid, and described in (U.S. Pat. No. 8,299,112; U.S. Pat. No. 8,455,534; WO 2012/037411; WO 2012/037410; Lai et al (2015) J. Med. Chem. 58:4888-4904) which are expressly incorporated by reference). As used herein, GDC-0810 includes all stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
GDC-0810, and reagents and intermediates for preparation of GDC-0810, as compounds of the invention, may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.
The compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms.
The compounds of the invention may also exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The term “tautomer” or “tautomeric form” refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.
The compounds of the invention also include isotopically-labeled compounds which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention, and their uses. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 13N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 32P, 33P, 35S, 18F, 36Cl, 123I and 125I. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention (e.g., those labeled with 3H and 14C) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (3H) and carbon-14 (14C) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as 15O, 13N, 11C and 18F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.
Starting materials and reagents for the preparation of GDC-0810 are generally available from commercial sources or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis, v. 1-19, Wiley, N.Y. (1967-1999 ed.), or Beilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie, 4, Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available via the Beilstein online database).
The following Schemes 1-13 illustrate the chemical reactions, processes, methodology for the synthesis of GDC-0810, Formula I, and certain intermediates and reagents.
Scheme 1 shows conversion of 5-bromo-1H-indazole to 5-(but-1-yn-1-yl)-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazole V (Examples 1 and 2). This process to prepare V is superior as an improvement over methods described in WO 2012/037410 and WO 2012/037411. In particular, WO 2012/037410 and WO 2012/037411 teach reacting V with trimethylsilylacetylene under Sonogashira cross-coupling conditions, followed by metalation of the acetylene proton and alkylation with iodoethane. The method of Scheme 1 has the advantage of avoiding the expensive trimethylsilylacetylene reagent and adding the but-1-yn-1-yl group directly and in one step to VII.
While PdCl2(dppf) is an effective catalyst or catalyst precursor for the reaction, other types of palladium catalysts or catalyst precursors can also be used. A Pd(II) complex is the catalyst precursor of the active catalyst, Pd(O) complex. 1,1′-Bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf), is an organophosphorus compound commonly used as a ligand in homogeneous catalysis. Nonlimiting examples of palladium catalysts or catalyst precursors include Pd2(dba)3, Na2PdCl4, and Pd(OAc)2. While dppf is an effective ligand for the reaction, other types of ligands (monodentate or bidentate) can also be used.
Nonlimiting examples of such ligands include P(t-Bu)3, P(o-Tol)3, as well as nonphosphorous ligands. The active catalyst is a Pd(O) catalyst which can be generated by using a Pd(O) source such as Pd2(dba)3 or Pd(PPh3)4 and a mono or bidentate ligand such as PR3 or dppf (and others) or the Pd(O) species can be generated in situ from a Pd(II) source such as Pd(OAc)2, Na2PdCl4 with a mono or bidentate phosphine such as PPh3, P(tBu)3, P(o-Tol)3, dppf, dppe (1,2-diphenylphosphinoethane).
While K2CO3 is an effective base for the reaction, other types of bases can also be used. Nonlimiting examples of such bases include Et3N, Et2NH, pyrrolidine, i-Pr2NH, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, morpholine, and Cs2CO3. A variety of solvents can be used in Sonogashira reaction, such as DMF, THF, 2-Me-THF, CH3CN, DMSO, toluene, and 1,4-dioxane.
Scheme 2 shows conversion of 5-(but-1-yn-1-yl)-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazole V to (E)-4-(2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)benzaldehyde III (Examples 3-5). This process to prepare III and IV is superior as an improvement over methods described in WO 2012/037410 (pages 70 and 71) and WO 2012/037411.
Borylation of V proceeds with 4,4,4′,4′,5,5,5′,5′-octamethyl-2,2′-bi(1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (bis(pinacolato)diboron (BzPinz) under platinum catalysis to give (Z)-5-(1,2-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazole VI (Example 3). Other borylation reagents and conditions may be used, such as 2,3-dimethylbutane-2,3-diol (pinacol) and naphthalene-1,8-diamine (Sugimome, et al (2010) Jour. Am. Chem. Soc. 132:2548); and B2Pin2 and 1,1′-azanediylbis(propan-2-ol) to form (4R,8R)-4,6,8-trimethyl-2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-1,3,6,2-dioxazaborocane (Santos, et al (2011) Jour. Org. Chem. 76:3397).
Reaction of VI with 4-bromobenzaldehyde (or 4-iodobenzaldehyde) under palladium catalysis gives (Z)-4-(1-(1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)-2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)benzaldehyde IV (Example 4).
While PdCl2 (dppf) is an effective catalyst for the reaction to prepare III from IV, other types of palladium catalysts or catalyst precursors may be useful for the reaction such as PdCl2(PPh3)2, Pd(t-Bu)3, PdCl2 dppf CH2Cl2, Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(OAc)/PPh3, Cl2Pd[(Pet3)]2, Pd(DIPHOS)2, Cl2Pd(Bipy), [PdCl(Ph2PCH2PPh2)]2, Cl2Pd[P(o-tol)3]2, Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3, Pd2(dba)/P(furyl)3, Cl2Pd[P(furyl)3]2, Cl2Pd(PMePh2)2, Cl2Pd[P(4-F-Ph)3]2, Cl2Pd[P(C6F6)3]2, Cl2Pd[P(2-COOH-Ph)(Ph)2]2, Cl2Pd[P(4-COOH-Ph)(Ph)2]2, and encapsulated catalysts Pd EnCat™ 30, Pd EnCat™ TPP30, and Pd(II)EnCat™ BINAP30, according to procedures analogous to those described in J. Tsuji, “Transition Metal Reagents and Catalysts, Innovations in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley & sons, Chichester, 2000 and references cited therein. Palladium catalyzed reactions may be conducted in the presence of organic solvents such as THF, tert-butylmethyl ether, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, dibutyl ether, cyclopentylmethyl ether, dimethyl acetal or dioxane, N,N-dimethylformamide and N-methylpyrrolidone, and with bases such as K3PO4, K2CO3, KHCO3, Cs2CO3, KOH, NaOH, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, N,N-diethylpropylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, and N-methylmorpholine.
Scheme 3 shows conversion of (E)-4-(2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)benzaldehyde III to (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid I (Examples 6 and 7). Intermediate III was treated with malonic acid, piperidine, and pyridine in toluene. Addition of dicyclohexylamine gave dicyclohexylammonium (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate II. The THP group was removed with aqueous acid in a solvent such as toluene. The aqueous acid may be, but not limited to, formic acid, hydrochloric acid, or sulfuric acid.
Scheme 4 shows conversion of (Z)-5-(1,2-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazole VI to (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid I (Examples 8 and 9). Intermediate VI was reacted with (E)-tert-butyl 3-(4-bromophenyl)acrylate and bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride in tetrahydrofuran, potassium phosphate tribasic and water to give (E)-tert-butyl 3-(4-((Z)-1-(1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)-2-(4,4,5, 5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate VIII. Alternatively, cesium carbonate can be used as the base in conversion of Intermediate VI to VIII. Intermediate VIII was reacted with 2-chloro-4-fluoroiodobenzene, bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride in aqueous potassium phosphate or alternatively in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide (Example 8) to give (E)-tert-butyl 3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate IX. Intermediate IX was treated with formic acid and sulfuric acid in water and toluene (Example 9), or alternatively with aqueous hydrochloric acid and methanol to give (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid I.
Scheme 5 shows conversion of methyl 4-bromobenzoate (CAS#619-42-1) to tert-butyl (E)-3-(4-(2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)butanoyl)phenyl)acrylate X (Example 10). The dianion of 2-chloro-4-fluorophenylacetic acid acylates methyl 4-bromobenzoate to give 1-(4-bromophenyl)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)butan-1-one XXIII which is reacted under Heck reaction conditions with tert-butyl acrylate and palladium catalysis to give X. Methyl 4-iodobenzoate can also be used to form XXIII
Scheme 6 shows conversion of methyl 4-formylbenzoate dimethylacetal XIX to tert-butyl (E)-3-(4-(2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)butanoyl)phenyl)acrylate X (Example 11). Acylation of the disodium salt of 2-chloro-4-fluorophenylacetic acid with methyl 4-formylbenzoate dimethyl acetal XIX, alkylation of the intermediate with iodoethane and hydrolysis of the dimethyl acetal gave 4-(2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)butanoyl)benzaldehyde XX. Reaction of XX with tert-butyldiethylphosphonoacetate in the presence of sodium hydride gave X.
Scheme 7 shows conversion of 5-bromo-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazole VII to 1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-1H-indazole XII according to Example 12. Alternatively, VII can be borylated with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane according to Example 13)
Scheme 8 shows conversion of 5-bromo-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazole VII to (1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)boronic acid XXII (Examples 14 and 15).
Scheme 9 shows conversion of (E)-tert-butyl 3-(4-(2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)butanoyl)phenyl)acrylate X to (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid I or pyrrolidin-1-ium (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate XVIII (Examples 16-18). The enolate of X was formed with lithium tert-butoxide in THF. Other strong bases such as lithium tert-pentoxide, lithium diisopropylamide and sodium hexamethydisilazide, and other solvents such as methyl t-butyl ether or 2-methyltetrahydrofuran may be used to form the enolate of X. The enolate of X was trapped with para-toluene sulfonic anhydride as (E)-tert-butyl 3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(tosyloxy)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate version of XI where E is Ts (tosyl), and a small amount of the undesired Z isomer (Example 16). Other electrophilic reagents may be used, including para-toluenesulfonic anhydride, para-toluenesulfonyl chloride, trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, methanesulfonic anhydride, methanesulfonyl chloride and diphenyl phosphoryl chloride to form XI. Coupling of XI and 1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-1H-indazole XII under palladium catalysis gave IX. Potassium phosphate, sodium hydroxide, and other bases may be used in this reaction. The boronic acid analog of XII, (1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)boronic acid, can also be used to couple with XI. Intermediate IX was treated with formic acid and sulfuric acid in water and toluene, or alternatively with aqueous hydrochloric acid and methanol to give (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid I (Example 17). An alternative isolation involves acid mediated deprotection of Intermediate XI with aqueous acid in toluene, followed by addition of pyrrolidine to give pyrrolidin-1-ium (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate XVIII (Example 18).

The Grignard reagent, (E)-(4-(3-(tert-butoxy)-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)magnesium chloride, formed from tert-butyl (E)-3-(4-iodophenyl)acrylate and isopropylmagnesium chloride and lithium chloride complex in THF, adds to XIII to give (E)-tert-butyl 3-(4-(2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-hydroxy-1-(1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)butyl)phenyl)acrylate XV (Example 21). Additives may also be used, including N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine and 2,2′-oxybis(N,N-dimethylethan-1-amine) to form Intermediate XV. The tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) ester is formed with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate and Intermediate XV to give the Boc derivative of Intermediate XVI where Z is tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Example 22). Other Z groups include pivaloyl, isopropyl carbonyl, methoxycarbonyl, N,N-dimethyl carbamoyl, diphenylphosphate, isobutoxycarbonyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl bis(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphoryl, diphenylphosphoryl, and diethylphosphoryl. Elimination by heat or under basic conditions gives tetra-substituted olefin IX (Example 22). Other derivatizing agents can be used to form a leaving group, such as pivalate, t-butyl carbonate, isopropyl carbonate, methyl carbonate, N,N-dimethyl carbamate, diphenylphosphate, isobutyl carbonate, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl bis(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphate, and diethylphosphate from the hydroxyl group of XV. Other elimination conditions can be used to form IX. Intermediate IX was treated with formic acid and sulfuric acid in water and toluene, or alternatively with aqueous hydrochloric acid and methanol to give (E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid I (Example 22).

Formulations
(E)-3-(4-((E)-2-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1H-indazol-5-yl)but-1-en-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid I (GDC-0810), and salts thereof, may be formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice for use in a therapeutic combination for therapeutic treatment (including prophylactic treatment) of hyperproliferative disorders in mammals including humans. The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising GDC-0810 in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, glidant, diluent, or excipient.
Suitable carriers, diluents, glidants, and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water and the like.
The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.
The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings.
Pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared for various routes and types of administration with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients, glidants or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1995) 18th edition, Mack Publ. Co., Easton, Pa.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation, milled powder, or an aqueous solution. Formulation may be conducted by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but may range from about 3 to about 8.
The pharmaceutical formulation is preferably sterile. In particular, formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. Such sterilization is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.
The pharmaceutical formulation ordinarily can be stored as a solid composition, a tablet, a pill, a capsule, a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.
The pharmaceutical formulations of the invention will be dosed and administered in a fashion, i.e., amounts, concentrations, schedules, course, vehicles and route of administration, consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners.
Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl, ethanol, or benzylalcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, including Tween 80, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG), including PEG400. The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 18th edition, (1995) Mack Publ. Co., Easton, Pa. Other examples of drug formulations can be found in Liberman, H. A. and Lachman, L., Eds., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Decker, Vol 3, 2nd Ed., New York, N.Y.
Pharmaceutically acceptable glidants may be selected from silicon dioxide, powdered cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, metallic stearates, sodium aluminosilicate, sodium benzoate, calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, corn starch, magnesium carbonate, asbestos free talc, stearowet C, starch, starch 1500, magnesium lauryl sulfate, magnesium oxide, and combinations thereof.
The pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for the administration routes detailed herein. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 18th Ed. (1995) Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.
Pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may be a solution or a suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared from a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.

Example 1 5-bromo-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazole VII
To an inerted, 1 L jacketed reactor was added 5-bromo-1H-indazole (CAS Reg. No. 53857-57-1, 40 g, 203 mmol), toluene (200 mL) and p-toluene sulfonic acid monohydrate (0.39 g, 2 mmol) at 15-25° C. The reaction mixture is heated to 65-75° C. and 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran (18.8 g, 223 mmol) is added over 1 hr and the mixture is stirred for an additional 1 hr at 65-75° C. Once conversion is complete, as deemed by HPLC analysis, 5% aq. sodium bicarbonate (40 g) is charged to the reactor and stirred at 45-55° C. for at least 20 min. Stirring is stopped and the layers are allowed to separate for at least 30 min at 45-55° C. The aqueous layer is removed and water (40 g) is charged to the reactor and stirred at 45-55° C. for at least 20 min. Stirring is stopped and the layers are allowed to separate for at least 30 min at 45-55° C. The aqueous layer is removed and the organic phase is concentrated under vacuum (Tr=45-65° C., 350-50 mbar) to remove solvent (145-160 g) to give a concentrated toluene solution of 5-bromo-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazole VII (CAS Reg.

To an inerted, 1 L jacketed reactor was added 5-bromo-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazole (56 g, 199 mmol) VII (Example 1, WO 2012/037410, Intermediate 1) as a toluene solution (70-85 g total mass). N,N-dimethylformamide (225 mL) and potassium carbonate (60.6 g, 438.4 mmol) were then charged at 20-30° C., then the reactor was inerted (two vacuum-argon cycles, ≤300 mbar for at least 3-5 minutes vacuum). Copper iodide (0.11 g, 0.57 mmol) and PdCl2(dppf) (0.29 g, 0.40 mmol) were charged to the reaction mixture and the reactor was inerted (two vacuum-argon cycles, ≤300 mbar for at least 3-5 minutes vacuum). 1-butyne (gaseous, 5.5 g, 101.7 mmol) was bubbled through the suspension at <30° C. The reaction mixture was then heated to 85-95° C. while applying a small, constant flow of 1-butyne (gaseous, 21.4 g, 395.6 mmol). After the addition of 1-butyne (total of 2.5 eq., 26.9 g) is complete, then suspension is heated at 85-95° C. for at least 1 hr. Conversion was monitored by HPLC and once the reaction was complete, the mixture was distilled under vacuum (Tr=75-90° C., 150-80 mbar) to remove solvent (50-65 g total). The reaction mixture is cooled to 0-5° C. and 12.5% w/w aq. ammonium hydroxide (30 g) is added dropwise over 20 min. Seeds are charged at 0-5° C. and the mixture is stirred for at least 15 min. Additional 12.5% w/w aq. ammonium hydroxide (270 g) is then added over 1 hr at 0-5° C. and the resulting suspension is stirred for another 30 min. The solids are filtered off and the filter cake is washed with 12.5% w/w aq. ammonium hydroxide (75 g), followed by water (75 g) and finally two heptane (2×51 g) washes. The solids are dried at 35-40° C. to give crude 5-(but-1-yn-1-yl)-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazole V (44 g, 165 mmol).
Crude V (44 g, 165 mmol) was charged to a 1 L inerted reactor along with heptane (120 mL) and heated to 55-65° C. for at least 15 min. Water (20 mL) is charged to the reaction mixture and stirred at 55-65° C. for at least 30 min. Stirring is stopped and the layers are allowed to separate for at least 30 min at 45-55° C. The aqueous layer is removed and activated charcoal (4 g) is charged to the reactor and stirred at 60-70° C. for at least 2 hr. The suspension is filtered and washed with heptane (20 mL, hot) and the resulting solution is concentrated under vacuum (Tr=50-65° C., 300-100 mbar) to remove solvent (110-120 mL). The concentrated solution is cooled to 30-40° C. and seeded, then stirred for at least 20 min at 30-40° C. The suspension is then cooled to −15 to −5° C. over 1 hr and aged for an additional 1 hr. Solids are filtered off and dried under vacuum at 35-40° C. to give 5-(but-1-yn-1-yl)-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-1H-indazole V (37.4 g, 147 mmol, 74% yield). 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 8.08 (s, 1H), 7.82 (s, 1H), 7.69 (d, 1H), 7.39 (d, 1H), 5.84 (dd, 1H), 3.89-3.86 (m, 1H), 3.76-3.72 (m, 1H), 2.45-2.36 (m, 3H), 2.04-1.94 (m, 2H), 1.74 (m, 1H), 1.57-1.20 (m, 2H), 1.16 (t, 3H); LCMS: 255 (M+H)+.
