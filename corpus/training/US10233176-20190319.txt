BACKGROUND
Technical Field
The present disclosure provides compounds that inhibit protein kinases Tyro3, Axl and Mer (TAM family kinases), prodrugs of the compounds, intermediates and methods of synthesizing the compounds and/or prodrugs, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and/or prodrugs and methods of using the compounds and/or prodrugs in a variety of contexts, including, for example, in the treatment and/or prevention of various diseases that are responsive to TAM family kinase inhibition and/or that are mediated, at least in part, by abnormal TAM family kinase activity.
Description of the Related Art
The receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins and function as sensors for extracellular ligands, which transduce signals from extracellular medium to the cytoplasm. Their activation leads to the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of the downstream signaling pathways, which ultimately regulate cellular functions such as proliferation, growth, differentiation or motility. Abnormal overexpression levels and/or enhanced activities of RTKs have been associated to a variety of human cancers, leading to a strong interest in the development of inhibitors against these human cancers. Tyro-3, Axl, and Mer constitute the TAM family of RTKs characterized by a conserved sequence within the kinase domain and adhesion molecule like extracellular domains. With varying degree of specificity and affinity, TAM kinases can be activated by the vitamin K-dependent ligand Gas6 and/or Protein S. Strong evidence supports their association with both cancer (gain-in-function) and autoimmunity (loss-of-function). TAM kinase signaling has been implicated in a myriad of cellular responses, many of which are the hallmarks of cancer, including proliferation, survival, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. In addition, TAM plays pivotal roles innate immunity through inhibiting inflammation in macrophages and dendritic cells and promoting the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. While the oncogenic activity of TAM kinases appears to be mediated via PI3K/AKT pathway, the JAK-STAT pathway is critical for their roles in immune responses. Overexpression of TAM kinases has been observed in over 20 human cancers. The level of their expression was shown to correlate with shorter progression-free and overall survival and their up-regulation has been linked to cancer resistance to cytotoxic drugs and targeted therapies.
While broadly expressed in various human tumor cell lines, Tyro3, Axl, and Mer exhibit their respective tissue-specific expression patterns. Tyro-3 is highly expressed in the nervous system whereas, Axl is expressed ubiquitously. Higher level of Mer is often found in hematopoietic lineages such as monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, NKT cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets.
Compared to Axl and Mer, Tyro3 is the least studied kinase of the TAM family. Implication of Tyro3 in tumorigenesis was only recently substantiated by recent studies, which revealed Tyro3 is a potential oncogene in melanoma that is linked to poorer outcome of patients suffering from melanoma regardless the BRAF or NRAS status by conferring survival advantage to melanoma cells. It was also identified as one of kinases significantly up-regulated in lung cancer by a phosphoproteomic screen. High level of Tyro3 expression has also been correlated with thyroid cancer.
As the founding member of the TAM kinase family, Axl was discovered as a transforming gene in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Axl overexpression has since been reported in a wide range of human malignancies and is associated with invasiveness and metastasis in lung, prostate, breast and pancreatic cancer. Axl is also an important regulator of breast cancer metastasis and EMT. Activation of the Axl kinase confers resistance to EGFR targeted therapy in lung cancer. Upregulation of Axl has been implicated as a mechanism of resistance to imatinib in CML and gastrointestinal stromal tumors and to lapatinib in breast cancer. Axl expression has also been associated with chemoresistance in AML, NSCLC and ovarian cancer. Mer is overexpressed/over-activated in a wide variety of cancers and has been established as a therapeutic target in hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors including leukemia, nonsmall cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, pituitary adenomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas. Oncogenic potential of Mer is mediated through the activation of several canonical oncogenic signaling pathways including the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways, as well as regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription family members, migration-associated proteins including the focal adhesion kinase and myosin light chain 2, and prosurvival proteins such as survivin and Bcl-2. In neoplastic cells, these signaling events result in functional phenotypes such as decreased apoptosis, increased migration, chemoresistance, increased colony formation, and increased tumor formation in murine models. Conversely, Mer inhibition by genetic or pharmacologic means can reverse these pro-oncogenic phenotypes.

“Prodrugs” refers to a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound of Formula (I) or any one of the substructures. Thus, the term “prodrug” refers to a metabolic precursor of a compound of Formula (I) or any one of the substructures, that is pharmaceutically acceptable; the latter is also referred to as a “parent compound.” A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject in need thereof, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, i.e., the parent compound. Prodrugs are typically rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound, for example, by hydrolysis in blood. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam).
A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,” A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein.
The term “prodrug” is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers which release the active compound of the disclosure in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of a compound of the disclosure may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound of Formula (I) or any one of the substructures in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of the disclosure wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug disclosure is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to restore the free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate, and phosphate derivatives of alcohol or amine functional groups in the compounds of Formula (I), (IA), (IB) or any one of the substructures.
“Stable compound” and “stable structure” are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.
“Mammal” or “mammalian subject” includes humans and domestic animals, such as cats, dogs, swine, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, rabbits, and the like.
“Optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event of circumstances may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, “optionally substituted aryl” means that the aryl radical may or may not be substituted and that the description includes both substituted aryl radicals and aryl radicals having no substitution.
“Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient” includes without limitation any adjuvant, carrier, excipient, glidant, sweetening agent, diluent, preservative, dye/colorant, flavor enhancer, surfactant, wetting agent, dispersing agent, suspending agent, stabilizer, isotonic agent, solvent, or emulsifier which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as being acceptable for use in humans or domestic animals.
“Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt” refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, but not limited to, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as, but not limited to, acetic acid, 2,2-dichloroacetic acid, adipic acid, alginic acid, ascorbic acid, aspartic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, 4-acetamidobenzoic acid, camphoric acid, camphor-10-sulfonic acid, capric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, carbonic acid, cinnamic acid, citric acid, cyclamic acid, dodecylsulfuric acid, ethane-1,2-disulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, galactaric acid, gentisic acid, glucoheptonic acid, gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, glutamic acid, glutaric acid, 2-oxo-glutaric acid, glycerophosphoric acid, glycolic acid, hippuric acid, isobutyric acid, lactic acid, lactobionic acid, lauric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, mucic acid, naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid, naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, nicotinic acid, oleic acid, orotic acid, oxalic acid, palmitic acid, pamoic acid, propionic acid, pyroglutamic acid, pyruvic acid, salicylic acid, 4-aminosalicylic acid, sebacic acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, thiocyanic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, undecylenic acid, and the like.
“Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt” refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free acids, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. These salts are prepared from addition of an inorganic base or an organic base to the free acid. Salts derived from inorganic bases include, but are not limited to, the sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like. Preferred inorganic salts are the ammonium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Salts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as ammonia, isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, diethanolamine, ethanolamine, deanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, 2-diethylaminoethanol, dicyclohexylamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, procaine, hydrab amine, choline, betaine, benethamine, benzathine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, methylglucamine, theobromine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, purines, piperazine, piperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, polyamine resins and the like. Particularly preferred organic bases are isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, trimethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, choline and caffeine.
Often crystallizations produce a solvate of the compound of the disclosure. As used herein, the term “solvate” refers to an aggregate that comprises one or more molecules of a compound of the disclosure with one or more molecules of solvent. The solvent may be water, in which case the solvate may be a hydrate. Alternatively, the solvent may be an organic solvent. Thus, the compounds of the present disclosure may exist as a hydrate, including a monohydrate, dihydrate, hemihydrate, sesquihydrate, trihydrate, tetrahydrate and the like, as well as the corresponding solvated forms. The compound of the disclosure may be true solvates, while in other cases, the compound of the disclosure may merely retain adventitious water or be a mixture of water plus some adventitious solvent.
A “pharmaceutical composition” refers to a formulation of a compound of the disclosure and a medium generally accepted in the art for the delivery of the biologically active compound to mammals, e.g., humans. Such a medium includes all pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients therefor.
“Therapeutically effective amount” refers to that amount of a compound of the disclosure which, when administered to a mammal, preferably a human, is sufficient to effect treatment, as defined below, of a disease or condition in the mammal, preferably a human. The amount of a compound of the disclosure which constitutes a “therapeutically effective amount” will vary depending on the compound, the condition and its severity, and the age of the mammal to be treated, but can be determined routinely by one of ordinary skill in the art having regard to his own knowledge and to this disclosure.
“Treating” or “treatment” as used herein covers the treatment of the disease or condition of interest in a mammal, preferably a human, having the disease or disorder of interest, and includes:
(i) preventing the disease or condition from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the condition but has not yet been diagnosed as having it;
(ii) inhibiting the disease or condition, i.e., arresting its development; or
(iii) relieving the disease or condition, i.e., causing regression of the disease or condition.
As used herein, the terms “disease” and “condition” may be used interchangeably or may be different in that the particular malady or condition may not have a known causative agent (so that etiology has not yet been worked out) and it is therefore not yet recognized as a disease but only as an undesirable condition or syndrome, wherein a more or less specific set of symptoms have been identified by clinicians.
The compounds of the disclosure, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)- or, as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids. The present disclosure is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (+) and (−), (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques, such as HPLC using a chiral column. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.
A “stereoisomer” refers to a compound made up of the same atoms bonded by the same bonds but having different three-dimensional structures, which are not interchangeable. The present disclosure contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and includes “enantiomers”, which refers to two stereoisomers whose molecules are non-superimposeable mirror images of one another.
A “tautomer” refers to a proton shift from one atom of a molecule to another atom of the same molecule. The present disclosure includes tautomers of any said compounds.
An “isotopically enriched derivative” refers to a compound wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the disclosure comprises isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H, carbon, such as 11C, 13C and 14C, chlorine, such as 38Cl, fluorine, such as 18F, iodine, such as 123I and 125I, nitrogen, such as 13N and 15N, oxygen, such as 15O, 17O and 18O, phosphorus, such as 31P, 32P and 33P, and sulphur, such as 35S. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically-enriched compounds of the disclosure can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations Sections using an appropriate isotopically-enriched reagent in place of the non-enriched reagent previously employed.
Where a bond is shown as a dashed line (---), it is understood that the location allows for the possibility of a double bond. For example, the structure of the linker W is shown as: in which each dash bond may, but not necessarily, indicate the presence of a double bond. For instance, when A is —NH═, A is connected to the two adjacent carbon atoms by a single bond and a double bond, respectively. On the other hand, if A is defined as —O—, A is connected to the two adjacent carbon atoms by single bonds, respectively. The location and number of the double bonds in a given ring structure of W should satisfy the valence requirement, as would be recognized by a skilled person in the art.
The chemical naming protocol and structure diagrams used herein employ and rely the chemical naming features as utilized by Chemdraw version 12.0.2.1076 (available from Cambridgesoft Corp., Cambridge, Mass.). For complex chemical names employed herein, a substituent group is named before the group to which it attaches. For example, cyclopropylethyl comprises an ethyl backbone with cyclopropyl substituent. In chemical structure diagrams, all bonds are identified, except for some carbon atoms which are assumed to be bonded to sufficient hydrogen atoms to complete the valency.
For example, a compound of formula (I), as set forth above in the Summary of this disclosure, where W is a divalent oxazolyl moiety connected to the 2-aminopyridine moiety and the R1 group at 2 and 5 positions: L is 1H-pyrazol-4-yl, R1 is 4-chlorophenyl, R2 is 1-(piperidin-4-yl), R3, R4 and R5 are each hydrogen, i.e., a compound of the following formula: is named herein as: 3-(5-(4-chlorophenyl)oxazol-2-yl)-5-(1-(piperidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridin-2-amine.
It should be note that there are two possible ways for W to connect with the 2-aminopyridine moiety and the R1 group, namely, the oxazolyl may be connected at its 2 position to the 2-aminopyridine moiety, as shown above; or the oxazolyl may be connected at its 5 position to the 2-aminopyridine moiety. Thus, the following compound is also encompassed by Formula (I), when L is 1H-pyrazol-4-yl, R1 is 4-chlorophenyl, R2 is 1-(piperidin-4-yl), and R3, R4 and R5 are hydrogens:
Similarly, the linker L, which is a divalent radical, may also have two possible ways to connect the 2-aminopyridine and the R2 group. For instance, when L is an amido linker, i.e., —CON(R6)—, a compound of Formula (I) may have the carbonyl portion directly connected to the 2-aminopyridine moiety. Another compound of Formula (I) may have the carbonyl portion directly connected to the R2 group.
As another example, a compound of formula (I), as set forth above in the Summary of this disclosure, where W is a divalent 1,3,4-oxadiazolyl moiety connected to the 2-aminopyridine moiety and the R1 group at 2 and 5 positions: L is 1H-pyrazol-4-yl, R1 is 2,6-dichlorophenyl, R2 is 1-(piperidin-4-yl), R3 and R4 are each hydrogen, i.e., a compound of the following formula: is named herein as: 3-(5-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-5-(1-(piperidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridin-2-amine.

Typically, a successful inhibitory therapeutic agent of the activity of Tyro3, Axl or Mer individually or any combination of them will meet some or all of the following criteria. Oral availability should be at or above 20% Animal model efficacy is less than about 20 mg/Kg, 2 mg/Kg, 1 mg/Kg, or 0.5 mg/Kg and the target human dose is between 10 and 250 mg/70 Kg, although doses outside of this range may be acceptable. (“mg/Kg” means milligrams of compound per kilogram of body mass of the subject to whom it is being administered). The required dosage should preferably be no more than about once or twice a day or at meal times. The therapeutic index (or ratio of toxic dose to therapeutic dose) should be greater than 10. The IC50 (“Inhibitory Concentration—50%”) is a measure of the amount of compound required to achieve 50% inhibition of the kinase activity, over a specific time period, in a kinase activity assay. Any process for measuring the kinase activity of Tyro3, Axl or Mer, preferably human Tyro3, Axl or Mer, may be utilized to assay the activity of the compounds useful in the methods of the disclosure in inhibiting said Tyro3, Axl or Mer activity. Compounds of the disclosure demonstrate an IC50 in a 15 to 60 minute recombinant human kinase assay of preferably less than 10 mM, less than 5 μM, less than 2.5 μM, less than 1 μM. less than 750 nM, less than 500 nM, less than 250 nM, less than 100 nM, less than 50 nM, and most preferably less than 20 nM. Compounds of the disclosure may show reversible inhibition (i.e. competitive inhibition) or irreversible inhibition and preferably do not inhibit other protein kinases.
The identification of compounds of the disclosure as Tyro3, Axl or Mer inhibitors was readily accomplished using the recombinant human Tyro3, Axl and Mer proteins and employing the 33P-radiolabeled phosphate transfer assay for which the procedure is known to someone skilled in the art or as described in Example 18. When tested in this assay, compounds of the disclosure had greater than 50% inhibitory activity at 10 μM concentration of the test compound, preferably greater than 60% inhibitory activity at 10 μM concentration of the test compound, more preferably greater than 70% inhibitory activity at 10 μM concentration of the test compound, and even more preferably greater than 80% inhibitory activity at 10 μM concentration of the test compound, and the most preferably greater than 90% inhibitory activity at 10 μM concentration of the test compound, thereby demonstrating that the compounds of the disclosure are potent inhibitors of the kinase activity of Tyro3, Axl and Mer.
These results provide the basis for analysis of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) between test compounds and the kinase activity of Tyro3, Axl and Mer. Certain-groups tend to provide more potent inhibitory compounds. SAR analysis is one of the tools those skilled in the art may employ to identify preferred embodiments of the compounds of the disclosure for use as therapeutic agents. Other methods of testing the compounds disclosed herein are also readily available to those skilled in the art. Thus, in addition, the determination of the ability of a compound to inhibit Tyro3, Axl and Mer activity may be accomplished in vivo. In one such embodiment this is accomplished by administering said chemical agent to an animal afflicted with a certain tumor graft model and subsequently detecting a change in tumor growth rate in said animal thereby identifying a therapeutic agent useful in treating the said tumors. In such embodiment, the animal may be a human, such as a human patient afflicted with such a disorder and in need of treatment of said disorder.
In specific embodiments of such in vivo processes, said change in Tyro3, Axl or Mer activity in said animal is a decrease in activity, preferably wherein said Tyro3, Axl or Mer inhibiting agent does not substantially inhibit the biological activity of other kinases.

Compositions that will be administered to a subject or patient take the form of one or more dosage units, where for example, a tablet may be a single dosage unit, and a container of a compound of the disclosure in aerosol form may hold a plurality of dosage units. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition (Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, 2000). The composition to be administered will, in any event, contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the disclosure, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for treatment of a disease or condition of interest in accordance with the teachings of this disclosure.
A pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure may be in the form of a solid or liquid. In one aspect, the carrier(s) are particulate, so that the compositions are, for example, in tablet or powder form. The carrier(s) may be liquid, with the compositions being, for example, an oral oil, injectable liquid or an aerosol, which is useful in, for example, inhalatory administration.
When intended for oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition is preferably in either solid or liquid form, where semi-solid, semi-liquid, suspension and gel forms are included within the forms considered herein as either solid or liquid.
As a solid composition for oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated into a powder, granule, compressed tablet, pill, capsule, chewing gum, wafer or the like form.

The liquid pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure, whether they be solutions, suspensions or other like form, may include one or more of the following adjuvants: sterile diluents such as water for injection, saline solution, preferably physiological saline, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride, fixed oils such as synthetic mono or diglycerides which may serve as the solvent or suspending medium, polyethylene glycols, glycerin, propylene glycol or other solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl paraben; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Physiological saline is a preferred adjuvant. An injectable pharmaceutical composition is preferably sterile. A liquid pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure intended for either parenteral or oral administration should contain an amount of a compound of the disclosure such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Typically, this amount is at least 0.01% of a compound of the disclosure in the composition. When intended for oral administration, this amount may be varied to be between 0.1 and about 70% of the weight of the composition. Preferred oral pharmaceutical compositions contain between about 4% and about 75% of the compound of the disclosure. Preferred pharmaceutical compositions and preparations according to the present disclosure are prepared so that a parenteral dosage unit contains between 0.01 to 10% by weight of the compound prior to dilution of the disclosure.
The pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure may be intended for topical administration, in which case the carrier may suitably comprise a solution, emulsion, ointment or gel base. The base, for example, may comprise one or more of the following: petrolatum, lanolin, polyethylene glycols, bee wax, mineral oil, diluents such as water and alcohol, and emulsifiers and stabilizers. Thickening agents may be present in a pharmaceutical composition for topical administration. If intended for transdermal administration, the composition may include a transdermal patch or iontophoresis device. Topical formulations may contain a concentration of the compound of the disclosure from about 0.1 to about 10% w/v (weight per unit volume). The pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure may be intended for rectal administration, in the form, for example, of a suppository, which will melt in the rectum and release the drug. The composition for rectal administration may contain an oleaginous base as a suitable nonirritating excipient. Such bases include, without limitation, lanolin, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycol. The pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure may include various materials, which modify the physical form of a solid or liquid dosage unit. For example, the composition may include materials that form a coating shell around the active ingredients. The materials that form the coating shell are typically inert, and may be selected from, for example, sugar, shellac, and other enteric coating agents. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be encased in a gelatin capsule.
The pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure in solid or liquid form may include an agent that binds to the compound of the disclosure and thereby assists in the delivery of the compound. Suitable agents that may act in this capacity include a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody, a protein or a liposome. The pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure may consist of dosage units that can be administered as an aerosol. The term aerosol is used to denote a variety of systems ranging from those of colloidal nature to systems consisting of pressurized packages. Delivery may be by a liquefied or compressed gas or by a suitable pump system that dispenses the active ingredients. Aerosols of compounds of the disclosure may be delivered in single phase, bi-phasic, or tri-phasic systems in order to deliver the active ingredient(s). Delivery of the aerosol includes the necessary container, activators, valves, subcontainers, and the like, which together may form a kit. One of ordinary skill in the art, without undue experimentation may determine preferred aerosols. The pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure may be prepared by methodology well known in the pharmaceutical art. For example, a pharmaceutical composition intended to be administered by injection can be prepared by combining a compound of the disclosure with sterile, distilled water so as to form a solution. A surfactant may be added to facilitate the formation of a homogeneous solution or suspension. Surfactants are compounds that non-covalently interact with the compound of the disclosure so as to facilitate dissolution or homogeneous suspension of the compound in the aqueous delivery system.
The compounds of the disclosure, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are administered in a therapeutically effective amount, which will vary depending upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed; the metabolic stability and length of action of the compound; the age, body weight, general health, sex, and diet of the patient; the mode and time of administration; the rate of excretion; the drug combination; the severity of the particular disorder or condition; and the subject undergoing therapy. Generally, a therapeutically effective daily dose is (for a 70 kg mammal) from about 0.001 mg/kg (i.e., 0.7 mg) to about 100 mg/kg (i.e., 7.0 gm); preferably a therapeutically effective dose is (for a 70 kg mammal) from about 0.01 mg/kg (i.e., 7 mg) to about 50 mg/kg (i.e., 3.5 g); more preferably a therapeutically effective dose is (for a 70 kg mammal) from about 1 mg/kg (i.e., 70 mg) to about 25 mg/kg (i.e., 1.75 g).
Compounds of Formula (I), (IA), (IB) or substructures thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, may also be administered simultaneously with, prior to, or after administration of one or more other therapeutic agents. Such combination therapy includes administration of a single pharmaceutical dosage formulation which contains a compound of the disclosure and one or more additional active agents, as well as administration of the compound of the disclosure and each active agent in its own separate pharmaceutical dosage formulation. For example, a compound of the disclosure and the other active agent can be administered to the patient together in a single oral dosage composition such as a tablet or capsule, or each agent administered in separate oral dosage formulations. Where separate dosage formulations are used, the compounds of the disclosure and one or more additional active agents can be administered at essentially the same time, i.e., concurrently, or at separately staggered times, i.e., sequentially; combination therapy is understood to include all these regimens.
Isotopic Enrichment of Compounds Isotopic enrichment is a process by which the relative abundance of the isotopes of a given element are altered, thus producing a form of the element that has been enriched in one particular isotope and depleted in its other isotopic forms. Isotopic enrichment of a drug are used for the following applications: reducing or eliminating unwanted metabolites; increasing the half-life of the parent drug; decreasing the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect; decreasing the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect; increasing the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed; and/or decreasing the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not.
Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect. For example, if a C—H bond is broken during a rate-determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (Foster et. al., Adv. Drug Res., 1985, 14, 1-36; Kushner et. al., Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., 1999, 77, 79-88).
Improvement of metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity profiles of pharmaceuticals by isotopic enrichment such as deuteration has been demonstrated by the following examples: Lijinsky et. al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 1982, 69, 1127-1133; Gately et. al., J. Nucl. Med., 1986, 27, 388-394; Gordon et. al., Drug Metab. Dispos., 1987, 15, 589-594; Mangold et. al., Mutation Res., 1994, 308, 33-42; Zello et. al., Metabolism, 1994, 43, 487-491; Wade D., Chem. Biol. Interact., 1999, 117, 191-637.

Preparation 1
PREPARATION OF 2-AMINO-1-PHENYLETHANONE HYDROCHLORIDE
To a solution of 2-bromo-1-phenylethanone (5.00 g, 25.0 mmol) in 25 mL of chloroform was added a solution of hexamethylenetetramine (3.50 g, 25.0 mmol) in 15 mL of chloroform dropwise.

Kinase Enzymatic Activity Assays
Preparation of Active Recombinant Kinase Proteins:
Recombinant human Tyro3 (455-end, the gene accession number NM_006293), human Axl (473-end, the gene accession number NM_021913) and human Mer (578-872, the gene accession number NM_006343) were independently expressed by baculovirus in Sf9 insect cells using an N-terminal GST tag. The recombinant proteins were stored at −70° C. in a medium containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM glutathione, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF and 25% glycerol. The recombinant proteins were aliquoted into smaller quantities after centrifugation to avoid repeated handling and multiple freeze/thaw cycles for the most favorable performance.
Preparation of Assay Reagents:
Kinase Assay Buffer: This buffer solution consisted of the following components: 25 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 12.5 mM β-glycerol-phosphate, 25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA and DTT 0.25 mM which was added prior to use.
Kinase Dilution Buffer: Kinase Assay Buffer was diluted at a 1:4 ratio (5× dilution) with distilled water.
[33P]-ATP assay cocktail: In a designated radioactive working area, a 250 μM [33P]-ATP assay cocktail was prepared by the addition of the following components: 150 μL of 10 mM ATP stock solution, 100 μL [33P]-ATP (1 mci/100 μL), 5.75 mL of kinase assay buffer. This solution was stored in 1 mL aliquots at −20° C.
ATP stock solution (10 mM): The ATP stock solution was prepared by dissolving 55 mg of ATP in 10 mL of kinase assay buffer. It was stored in 200 μL aliquots at −20° C.
Active Kinase Stock Solution: The active recombinant kinase protein (0.1 μg/μL) was diluted with Kinase Dilution Buffer and the activity was assayed using a serial dilution method. The specific activity is expressed in nmoL/min/mg.
Substrates: poly(4:1 glu:tyr) is the substrate used for each kinase Tyro3, Axl and Mer: The peptide substrate was dissolved in water to give the final concentration of 1 mg/mL.
Test compound solution: Test compound was dissolved in DMSO to obtain a 10 mM solution. The assay solution was prepared by adding 5 μL of this solution to 955 μL of 10% DMSO/water to obtain the final concentration of 50 μM.
Assay Procedure:
The enzymatic activity of all three kinases was determined as follows. Using a 96-well plate, the wells were divided into three categories: Blank wells, Background wells and Test wells. In Test wells, 5 μL of the test compound solution and 5 μL of the substrate solution were added. In Control wells, 5 μL of 10% DMSO/water and 5 μL of the substrate solution were added. In Blank wells, 10 μL of 10% DMSO/water was added. To each well was added 10 μL of Active Kinase Stock Solution to make up the volume in each well to 20 μL. All test samples, controls and blanks were run in duplicate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μL of [33P]-ATP assay cocktail, bringing the final volume up to 25 μL in every well. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The reaction was terminated by transferring 10 μL of the reaction mixture into a Millipore MultiScreen filter plate (cat. number MSPHN6B50). The filter plate was washed in a 1% phosphoric acid solution with constant gentle shaking for 15 minutes and this step was repeated once. After the plate was dried in air, scintillation fluid was added to each well and the radioactivity in each well in CPM was counted by a Microbeta TriLux. The corrected CPM in each test well was determined by subtracting the average value of Blank well values. Percentage of inhibition of the kinase enzymatic activity by the test compound was determined using the following formula:
The IC50 values were determined in a similar way following a serial dilution of the test compound. The percentage of inhibition at each concentration was calculated following the above formula. The IC50 was estimated from the curve of % Inhibition against Concentration in log unit using Prism 5, version 5.01.
The following table summarizes the inhibitory activity on Tyro3, Axl and Mer of the compounds of the disclosure. “+” represents the IC50 is >10 μM; “++” represents the 1 μM<IC50<10 μM; “+++” represents the 0.5 μM<IC50<1 μM and “++++” represents the IC50<0.5 μM.

Cell Viability Assay
Cell lines and reagents: A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, HyClone) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life technologies) and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37° C. with 5% CO2.
Cell viability assay protocol: 5×103 A549 cells in 180 μL, of DMEM containing 0.5% FBS were seeded in 96-well flat bottom plates (Costar) and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37° C. with 5% CO2 for 24 hours. The test compound (20 μL) in different concentrations after a serial dilution was added to the wells to a final volume of 200 μL per well. The wells with zero compound concentration were used as the Control wells and the Test wells contained different concentrations of the test compound. To the Blank wells were added medium only. After 48 hours incubation, 40 μL, of MTS (Promega) was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 10 minutes to 1 hour at 37° C. The cell viability was estimated by measurement of optical density at 490 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices).
Example 20
Thymidine Incorporation Assay
1×104 A549 cells in 180 μL of DMEM containing 0.5% FBS were seeded in a 96-well white Isoplate (PerkinElmer) and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37° C. with 5% CO2 for 24 hours. The test compound in different concentrations after a serial dilution was added to the wells to a final volume of 200 μL per well. The wells with zero compound concentration were used as the Control wells and the wells containing different concentrations of the test compound were used as the Test wells. To the Blank wells were added water only. After 24-hour incubation, each well was labeled with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (specific activity, 26.8 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer), and plates were again incubated at 37° C. overnight. After incubation, 50 μL of cold trichloroacetic acid was added into each well and the plates were incubated at 4° C. for 1-2 hours. Plates were subsequently washed with distilled water 5 times and air-dried at room temperature. Scintillation liquid was added to each well and radioactivity in CPM was counted using a MicroBeta TriLux (PerkinElmer) counter. The corrected CPM in each well was determined by subtracting the average value of the Blank well values. Percentage of inhibition of the thymidine incorporation at tested concentrations by the test compound was determined using the following formula:
The IC50 was then estimated from the curve of % Inhibition against concentration in log unit using Prism 5, version 5.01.
Example 21
Colony Formation Assay (Method #1)
A549 cells were treated with the test compound at different concentrations (5, 1 and 0.2 μM) in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS at 37° C. for 1 hour. After treatment, cells were seeded in the agar containing the test compound at different concentrations as outlined above in 6-well plates and the plates were incubated at 37° C. for 2 weeks. DMEM containing the various concentrations of the test compound was added on the top of agar and changed every 2-3 days. The viable colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted. This example is to demonstrate the capability of test compounds to prevent the formation of colonies.
Example 22
Colony Formation Assay (Method #2)
17,500 A549 cells were seeded in agar in each well of 6-well plates and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37° C. for six days and the colonies were formed. The test compound dissolved in DMEM with different concentrations was added to the test wells of the plates and DMEM with no test compound or with diluted DMSO was added to the control wells. The plates were incubated at 37° C. for 18-20 days during which period the DMEM containing 10% FBS and the various concentrations of test compounds was changed every 2 to 3 days. The viable colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted. This example is to demonstrate the capability of teat compounds to inhibit the colony growth after they are established and/or to eliminate the established colonies.
Example 23
Western Blot Assay
5×105 A549 cells were starved in DMEM contains no FBS in 6-well plate overnight, and treated with different concentrations of test compounds in serum-free medium for 30 minutes at 37° C. Cells were subsequently stimulated with or without Gas6 (400 ng/mL) for 30 min at 37° C. Total proteins were extracted from the test compound treated cells using ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton-X 100, 0.1 (w/v) SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford assay. Twenty micrograms of total proteins were fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-rad). Transfer efficiency and loading were confirmed by reversible staining of the membrane with Ponseau S solution (MP Biomedicals) following protein transfer. Membranes were blocked at ambient temperature with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 hour and incubated with primary antibodies against Axl, Tyro3, phospho-AKT (Ser473), total AKT or β-actin at 4° C. After overnight incubation, membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 hour at ambient temperature. Membranes were washed in TBST following incubation with secondary antibodies. Bound antibody complexes were detected and visualized using Luminata Classico Western HRP Substrate (Millipore).
