FIELD
The present disclosure relates generally to compounds and methods for using the compounds to kill or inhibit the growth of parasites, and more specifically for killing or inhibiting growth of parasites that are heme auxotrophs.
BACKGROUND
Over 1.4 billion people across the globe are affected by Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD)—a group of thirteen parasitic and bacterial infections. NTD include the soil-transmitted helminthiasis, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and trachoma, as well as trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis. Often, individuals are infected with multiple NTD agents simultaneously. Currently, the effectiveness of all agents used to treat parasites is diminished by four factors: (a) resistance develops and spreads rapidly, (b) parasites do not actively transport drugs into their bodies, (c) many drugs (eg: anthelminthics) are effective only during certain developmental stages of the parasite, and (d) drugs tend to act on a specific type of parasite and are ineffective in controlling other parasite populations.
Although these are devastating diseases of global concern, their neglected status relative to other health concerns has resulted in a limited arsenal of therapeutic compounds for their treatment [Chatelain E, et al. Drug Des Devel Ther 2011, 5:175-181]. The trypanosomatid parasites L. major and L. amazonensis are causative agents of human cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Old World and New World, respectively. Combined, these two species are responsible for an estimated 2 million new infections annually with ˜350 million people living in areas of active parasite transmission. In many regions of the world, treatment of leishmaniasis still relies on toxic drugs such as pentavalent antimony, which requires high doses and lengthy courses of treatment, and alternative drugs are still costly and not widely available in endemic areas. This situation, combined with the recent increase in Leishmania infections in urban areas, highlights the urgent need for identification of essential pathways in these organisms that can be targeted by new drugs with lower toxicity.
It was previously demonstrated that the free-living roundworm C. elegans and parasitic nematodes cannot synthesize heme, an iron-containing heterocyclic organic ring structure, but instead acquires heme from either their environment or their host to survive and reproduce PMID: 15767563. It is generally accepted that parasites exhibit distinct adaptations that allow them to acquire nutrients unidirectionally from the host to sustain their growth and reproduction. An example of such an adaptation would be the uptake of heme which the parasite cannot produce but is synthesized by all vertebrates (hosts) via a highly conserved multi-step pathway [Hamza I, et al. Biochim Biophys Acta 2012, 1823(9):1617-1632]. This unusual requirement for external heme is also found in single-celled parasites such as Trypanosomes and Leishmania [Hamza I, et al. Biochim Biophys Acta 2012, 1823(9):1617-1632; Chang C S, et al. Mol Biochem Parasitol 1985, 16(3):267-276]. Thus, drugs that target heme transport pathways unique to the parasite and not shared by its mammalian host offers great therapeutic potential. A drug that blocks heme transport or that enters the parasite via a high affinity and essential heme uptake pathway can be a highly effective broad-spectrum therapeutic agent, since such transport mechanisms are likely to have similarities across multiple parasite species. Parasites that limit transport or become resistant to the drug will indirectly also limit heme uptake, suffering impaired growth and development, and this approach could be applied to the treatment of infections caused by a diverse group of parasites, including intestinal nematodes, lymphatic and cutaneous filarial nematodes, and the kinetoplastids Leishmania and Trypanosoma. Thus, there is an ongoing and unmet need for compounds that selectively inhibit targets that are exclusively expressed by the parasites, as opposed to their hosts, and for methods of using such compounds to limit growth or kill such parasites. The present disclosure meets this need.

The present disclosure provides compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, and methods of using the compounds for antagonizing one or more pathways required for the transport of heme. This therapeutic strategy was chosen based at least in part on the following observations: (a) heme is utilized in multiple, critical processes; (b) heme is required in all stages of development; (c) Leishmania and other parasitic heme auxotrophs cannot live without heme and actively ingest it; and (d) both humans and their parasites require heme, but the mechanisms used to fulfill this requirement differ between humans and their parasites.
In general, the disclosure is directed to killing or inhibiting the growth of parasitic organisms that acquire environmental heme, including but not necessarily limited to parasitic helminths, such as ascarids (Ascaris), filarias, hookworms, pinworms (Enterobius) and whipworms (Trichuris trichiura), and members of class Kinetoplastea, including but not necessarily limited to parasites of the genus Trypanosoma, such as T. brucei and T. cruzi and Leishmania, including all members of the Leishmania subgenuses.

Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, a representative scheme is presented herein to describe the synthesis of the aforementioned molecules:
Compounds of this disclosure were designed in part using the following information and approach.
HRG-1 Heme Transporters and Heme Homeostasis: The identification of HRG-1, the first metazoan heme importer/transporter, was accomplished using C. elegans, a roundworm that does not synthesize its own heme. HRG-1 and its paralog HRG-4 is a four transmembrane domain permease with homologs in vertebrates. Knockdown of hrg1 in zebrafish causes congenital malformations and profound anemia. In mammals, HRG1 is strongly expressed in macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system and specifically localizes to the phagolysosomal membranes during erythrophagocytosis (EP), a process that degrades over 5 million senescent RBCs per second. Depletion of Hrg1 in mouse macrophages causes attenuation of heme transport from the phagolysosomal compartment confirming that the long-sought heme transporter for macrophage heme-iron recycling is the mammalian homolog of C. elegans HRG-1.
Implications for Host-Pathogen Interactions: Like C. elegans, kinetoplastid parasites such as Trypanosomes and Leishmania cannot synthesize heme as they lack most of the heme synthesizing enzymes. The Leishmania ortholog of worm HRG-4 is designated LHR1, and was the first parasite heme transporter to be identified. Loss of a single LHR1 allele (LHR1+/−) causes severe growth defects while LHR1 null mutants (LHR1−/−) are not viable which indicates that LHR1-dependent heme transport is essential for parasite survival and that 50% reduction in LHR1 function is sufficient to significantly impair growth.
A HTS to identify small molecule antagonists of LHR1: To develop a cell-based high throughput screen (HTS) for small molecule antagonists of the LHR1, a heterologous yeast assay was developed. While S. cerevisiae synthesize their own heme (like humans), they lack a dedicated plasma membrane heme transporter. Correspondingly, yeast that are genetically defective in heme synthesis (Δhem1 mutant) are unable to grow unless they express LHR1 or HRG1 orthologs in the presence of low amounts of supplemented heme in the growth medium. However, if wildtype yeast expressing LHR1 are grown in the presence of a toxic heme analog gallium protoporphyrin IX (GaPPIX) instead of heme in the growth medium, the yeast die because mis-incorporation of GaPPIX into the yeast hemoproteins is cytotoxic as gallium cannot undergo redox reactions like the iron within heme. To exploit this assay, yeast stably-transformed with LHR1 were cultured in 384-well plates and candidate small molecule antagonists of LHR1 were identified from a chemical library of >200,000 compounds on the basis of “rescuing” yeast growth in the presence of the toxic GaPPIX as measured by optical absorbance for growth using a plate reader. The small molecule library was composed of the following compounds: 75,000 (ChemBridge Corp.); 100,000 (Chemical Diversity Labs); 22,000 (ComGenex); 1200 (TimTek), 1100 (Prestwick); and 450 (NIH clinical collection). The compounds in the library satisfy a relaxed set of Lipinsky's rules with 99% having a molecular weight<550 Da.
Validation and selectivity of compounds that antagonize LHR1 but not human HRG1: The top 960 hits, defined as being >3 standard deviations from the mean, were “cherry-picked” for validation and preliminary selectivity assessment ( FIG. 5D ). From these hits, 373 displayed some activity even at 10-fold lower concentration (0.5 μM) with the nine best leads able to fully rescue yeast growth under assay conditions. Though some of these sub-μM leads appeared to inhibit GaPPIX uptake in counterscreens of yeast expressing HRG-1's from other species such as C. elegans and human hHRG1, many were selective, displaying little or no human HRG1 antagonism, ruling out the possibility that the hits simply coordinate to GaPPIX. From the 373 compounds that showed selectivity for LHR1 over hHRG1 in the yeast assays, compounds that possessed chemically labile structures, shared similar chemical scaffolds, or showed poor (high) IC50 values in dose-response curves in yeast were eliminated. This resulted in the identification of 54 most efficacious compounds, all of which were next tested in Leishmania grown in normal medium or in heme depleted medium which upregulates LHR1 ( FIG. 1A ).
Validation of compounds in Leishmania: Several of the initial hits are toxic to L. amazonensis promastigotes at 50 M, with enhanced toxicity observed in wildtype strains grown in heme-deficient media that upregulates LHR1, supporting the concept that the drug effects are mediated, in part, through the LHR1 transporter itself ( FIG. 1A ). Although some of the HTS hits appear to have metabolic and chemical liabilities, several chemical series represent potent and drug-like inhibitors. Strikingly, some of the compounds decreased L. amazonensis viability in axenic culture by >90% at 5 μM and 10 μM such as Cmpd #34, a 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-hydroxy-1-dibenzofuranyl derivative. This compound was not identified from any other HTS that is publicly available ( FIGS. 1A &B).
To validate the in vivo efficacy of lead compounds against intracellular amastigotes in macrophages, primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mice were obtained and infected them with L. amazonensis amastigotes followed by incubation for 72 h with LHR1 antagonists or amphotericin B which kills intracellular Leishmania, as a positive control. Cells were then fixed and stained with DAPI which permits visualization of the host macrophage nuclei and parasite nuclei and kinetoplasts. Images collected with fluorescent microscopy were used to determine the ratio between total number of parasites and total number of host cells per treatment. Toxicity to host cells were measured by AlamarBlue viability assays. Both Cmpd #34 and novel antagonist FX40 killed about 50% of intracellular L. amazonensis amastigotes ( FIG. 4A ). The demonstration of this property of FX40 led to the development of FX104. (Sch.1 and FIG. 4A ) The structure of FX104 is shown in Scheme 1. Without intending to be constrained by any particular theory or approach, FX104 was determined to have the best drug-like parameters with significantly lower Log P value; better solubility, absorption and metabolic stability; and decreased P-gp efflux. The results show that (a) the novel compound FX104, synthesized from the original scaffold of FX40, is over 30-fold more effective against intracellular forms of Leishmania (IC50: 8 μM versus 250 nM, FIG. 5A ); and (b) FX104 has little or no toxicity in BMDMs even at 40-fold greater concentrations ( FIG. 5B ).
L. donovani metacyclic promastigotes were selectively enriched using a Ficoll density-step gradient. L. donovani metacyclic promastigotes were incubated with BMDMs at a macrophage:promastigote ratio of 1:10. After a 24 h incubation at 37° C. in 5% CO2, non-internalized promastigotes were removed by 4 washes and test compounds were added to the cultures and incubated at 37° C. for 72 h. Intracellular parasite viability was evaluated by DAPI staining. Consistent results obtained with L. amazonensis, Cmpd #34, FX40 and FX104 killed between 50-70% of intracellular parasites ( FIG. 4B ). As shown in FIG. 5C , embodiments of the disclosure include iterative SAR and CSP modeling to improve the efficacy of compounds of this disclosure in intra-macrophage assays, which may be performed prior to evaluating them for metabolic stability and ADME properties. In embodiments, compounds that attain an IC50 value that matches or surpasses that for Amphotericin B: IC50=0.05-0.1 μM against intra-macrophage L. amazonensis or 0.02-0.06 μM for intra-macrophage L. donovani (>90% efficacy) are provided.
To further assess the chemical stability of compounds of this disclosure, the compounds can be incubated with simulated gastric fluid, simulated intestinal fluid, mouse plasma, mouse liver S9 fraction as well as Caco-2 cell homogenate, and assessed as follows. After incubation for varying times, samples are removed and subsequently ice-cold acetonitrile is added to precipitate cellular protein and stop enzymatic activity. The samples are centrifuged at 12,000×g at 4° C. for 30 min and supernatant are collected for LC-MS/MS analysis. To determine the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of the compounds, mouse or human liver microsomes are prepared by differential centrifugation. The test compounds are incubated with microsomal preparation for varying times, along with representative cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors and antibodies. The metabolic reactions are stopped and the extracted samples are subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis for metabolite identification, quantitation, and metabolism kinetics. For toxicity evaluation in cells, the effect of lead compounds on the viability (MTT assay), cellular morphology (microscopy and histology), and nucleic acid stability (DNA fragmentation) can be evaluated, for example, in HeLa, HepG2, and/or HEK293 cells.
