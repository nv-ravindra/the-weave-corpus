CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
The present application is a national phase entry under 35 U.S.C. § 371 of International Application No. PCT/ES2013/070134, filed Mar. 6, 2013, published in Spanish, which claims priority from Spanish Patent Application No. P201230356, filed Mar. 9, 2012, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY
The present invention mainly relates to the pharmaceutical sector with applications intended for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases and any types of disorder or complaint that involve an oxidative process, or which, even though not being implicated in this process, proceed via the Nrf2 transcription factor. The invention is also applicable to any industrial sector with nutritional, homeopathic, phytotherapeutic, dietetic and/or cosmetic application.
PRIOR ART
Epidemiological and clinical studies have provided conclusive evidence showing that populations with a diet rich in crucifers such as broccoli, cauliflower, red cabbage, Brussels sprouts or cabbage are less prone to develop certain types of cancers, such as cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and of the respiratory tract. The prevention of chemical carcinogenesis and the chemo-therapeutic effect that diets of this type provide have been attributed to the high content of phytochemical compounds that are characterized structurally in that they contain a functional group of the isothiocyanate type (Conaway, C. C.; Yang, Y. M. Curr. Drug Metab. 2002, 3, 233).
Sulphoraphane [(Rs)-1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulphinyl)-butane] was isolated for the first time, from extracts of broccoli, in 1992. This chiral molecule, characterized in that it contains the functional groups isothiocyanate and sulphoxide, is one of the principal inducers of the phase 2 detoxifying enzymes and its high activity as a chemopreventive agent is extensively documented. Accordingly, the interest of the scientific community in compounds of this type and other similar compounds that may improve the therapeutic and pharmacological properties thereof has increased enormously in the last decade.
Sulphoraphane helps to prevent colon cancer, and acts as a preventive dietary agent against the development of stomach cancer caused by the action of Helicobacter pylori. Recent clinical and preclinical studies confirm this same chemopreventive activity in women at risk for breast cancer.
In addition to the effects on prevention, sulphoraphane and certain analogues have confirmed in human cell lines that they are effective in the treatment of various types of cancers that are already established, such as colon cancer and pancreatic cancer, among others. This anticancer activity is due in part to the fact that they are able to induce cellular apoptosis owing to the presence of the isothiocyanate group (Min Jung Kim; So Hee Kim; Soo-Jeong Lim. Anticancer Research. 2010, 30, 3611-3619). Thus, (R)-sulphoraphane inhibits the growth of human prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo and slows the development of this type of cancer in transgenic mouse models.
It was demonstrated recently that sulphoraphane provides protection against ultraviolet radiation, thus avoiding sun damage, degeneration caused by ROS (Reactive oxygen species) and the development of skin cancer (Talalay P.; Fahey J. W.; Healy Z. R.; Wehage S. L.; Benedict A. L.; Min C.; Dinkova-Kostova A. T. PNAS. 2007, 104, 17500-17505). It also protects against respiratory inflammation that causes diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Riedl M. A.; Saxon A.; Díaz-Sánchez D. Clinical Immunology. 2009, 130, 244-251).
It should be pointed out that this phytochemical is capable of inhibiting mast cell degranulation, and can therefore be used as medicinal products, natural foods and cosmetics for treating atopic diseases, including atopic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and dermatitis (Japanese patent application No. JP 2006301959).
Another property that is attributed to these sulphoraphane-derived isothiocyanates is antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that these derivatives exert a protective action against Parkinson's disease (in a mouse model) and they also have diuretic, anti-anaemic and laxative properties, among others. Investigation of the molecular basis of the mechanism of action of sulphoraphane indicates that this product acts indirectly as an antioxidant, by stimulation of the phase 2 detoxifying enzymes. Concretely, it activates the Nrf2 cytoprotective transcription factor.
Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. The KEAP1 protein is a cytoplasmic repressor of Nrf2 that inhibits its capacity for translocation to the nucleus, where it stimulates gene expression of the phase 2 detoxifying enzymes. Nrf2 interacts with the KEAP1 protein via the glycine-rich domain of the latter and the hydrophilic region in the NEH2 domain of Nrf2. KEAP1 contains many cysteine residues, therefore the phase 2 enzyme inducers and/or the pro-oxidants can oxidize or covalently modify these cysteine residues. As a result, Nrf2 separates from KEAP1 and translocates to the nucleus. Once there, Nrf2 combines with the small MAF protein (term derived from musculo-aponeurotic-fibrosarcoma virus). Nrf2/MAF form a heterodimer that binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) and presents as target the genes coding for phase 2 detoxifying enzymes or antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase α2 (GSTA2), quinone oxidoreductase NADP (H) (NQO1), γ-glutamate-cysteine ligase (γ-GCLC and γ-GCLM) and haemo-oxygenase-1 (HO-1).
Sulphoraphane interacts directly with KEAP by a covalent bond via its thiol groups. 6-(Methylsulphinyl)hexyl isocyanate (6-HITC), a sulphorane similar to that of Japanese wasabi horseradish, stimulates translocation of Nrf2, which then activates ARE.
Therefore, and in contrast to the direct antioxidants in which each molecule is only capable of neutralizing another molecule of a free radical and they are destroyed in the process, the antioxidant effect of sulphoraphane is more lasting and effective since it activates genes implicated in protection against any oxidizing agent or carcinogen (epigenetic factor) (Young-Joon S. Science. 2003, 3, 768).
Moreover, it was demonstrated recently that the factor Nrf2 plays an important role in growth factor regulation, signalling and tissue repair, concretely regeneration of the liver induced by oxidative stress (Beyer T.; Xu W.; Teupser D.; Keller U.; Bugnon P.; Hildt E.; Thiery J.; Yuet Wai K.; Werner S. The EMBO Journal. 2008, 27, 212-223).
However, the low solubility of sulphoraphane in water, together with its relative chemical stability, has hampered its development as a medicinal product and its clinical use. Moreover, owing to the restrictions of the medicinal product agencies on chiral products, it is imperative to have both enantiomers of sulphoraphane and/or analogues for the purpose of determining the biological activity and cytotoxicity for each of them. In this sense, since sulphoraphane in particular and the sulphinyl isothiocyanates in general are dialkyl sulphoxides, their synthesis in enantiopure form by the methodologies described in the literature is impracticable.
For synthesis of compounds of this type, one of the major difficulties resides in the chirality of the sulphoxide group. Two methodologies are mainly used for the synthesis of chiral sulphoxides (I. Fernandez, N. Khiar. Chem. Rev. 2003, 103, 3651):
Asymmetric oxidation of prochiral sulphides: in which a metal is used as catalyst. The limitation of this methodology is that good asymmetric induction is only produced when there is a large difference in size between the substituents.
Another route is Andersen's methodology, modified by Mioskowski and Solladié, which allows a diastereoisomerically pure sulphinate to be obtained: menthyl (S)-p-toluenesulphinate, by a process of asymmetric transformation induced by crystallization. The drawback of this methodology is that only good asymmetric induction of the arylsulphoxides is obtained.
In 2009 a new methodology was published that makes it possible to obtain sulphoraphane and certain analogues in enantiomeric ally pure form (Khiar N.; Werner S.; Mallouk S.; Lieder F.; Alcudia A.; Fernandez I. J. Org. Chem. 2009, 74, 6002-6009). Access to analogues of synthetic origin makes it easier to conduct studies and establish structure-activity conclusions. In this way, a series of compounds was prepared that made it possible to determine that the nature of the substituent of the sulphinyl sulphur has an influence on the activity. Although these sulphoraphane derivatives that were prepared showed activity, it was greater in the alkyl- than in the aryl-sulphinyl derivatives, with a decrease in said activity being observed on increasing the size of the alkyl group.
In the present invention, for the first time sulphoraphane derivatives or analogues are synthesized that are more water-soluble than those known hitherto, bearing in mind that greater hydrophilicity may endow them with better bioavailability. Moreover, in the present invention, a methodology is used that was developed in the research group that includes the inventors, for the synthesis, for the first time, of both optical isomers or enantiomers of hydrophilic analogues of sulphoraphane in an efficient, enantiodivergent manner (enantiopure synthesis). It should be emphasized that this method uses just a single chiral alcohol (DAG) for the synthesis of two epimeric sulphinates on the sulphinyl sulphur, owing to a stereodirecting effect of the achiral base used in the process. Additionally, this methodology involves dynamic kinetic resolution of the starting sulphinyl chlorides. That is to say, this methodology provides access to both enantiomers selectively. The analogues synthesized showed excellent characteristics as activators of the Nrf2 transcription factor and chiral discrimination in the activation of certain phase 2 detoxifying enzymes.

Investigation of the Biological Activity of the Compounds of General Formula (I)
The biological activity of the products prepared in step 6′ and 6″ (6″c) was determined by two separate tests:
1) Luciferase Test (Gould S. J.; Subramani S. Anal. Biochem. 1998, 1, 5-13). This is a recombinant method that is used for measuring transcriptional activity of a gene indirectly by measuring the light emitted by luciferin in the presence of ATP. We may thus relate the light emitted directly to the functioning of the Nrf2 transcription factor.
The genes that code for luciferase are inserted into immortal cells of human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). These transfected cells that contain the luciferase gene under the control of a promoter of interest emit light as a result of reaction of the enzyme luciferase with luciferin, which is measured with a luminometer, relating said emission to the antioxidant activity of the sulphoraphane molecule and analogues thereof.
This test uses HaCaT cells transfected with a plasmid (“reporter gene”) that contains a 31-bp fragment of the rat promoter Nqo1 that includes ARE (pGL3-rNQ01 ARE) (Favreau, L. V.; Pickett, C. B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995, 270, 24468), and the countercurrent SV40 promoter of the luciferase gene.
Once the transfection mixture has been added to the cells, after 24 h they are incubated with fresh culture medium that contains various concentrations of sulphoraphane and its analogues (50 nm, 0.5 μM, 5 μM, 50 μM, 500 μM) or DMSO as negative control.
Next, the luciferase activity is determined with the MicroLumatPlus LB96V luminometer (EG&G Berthold), expressing the results as activation of X times in comparison with the cells treated with DMSO. The results correlate with the activity of the Nrf2 transcription factor ( FIG. 3 ). The concentrations of 50 and 500 μM proved toxic for the cells (data not included in the figure).
2) Quantitative real-time PCR ((qRT)-PCR): cells of the HaCaT line are treated with the sulphoraphane analogues for 24 h. At the end of this time, the cells are submitted to a lysis process for extracting the mRNA. This mRNA is transcribed into cDNA, which is used in PCR.
With this method, regulation of the endogenous genes that are the target of Nrf2 is quantified at the mRNA level. Concretely, expression of the genes that code for GCLc, GCLm and NQO1 is quantified ( FIG. 4 ).

Encapsulation of the Compounds of General Formula (I) in Cyclodextrins (CD). Investigation of Stability, Solubility in Water and Bioavailability
The inclusion complexes were prepared by physical mixing of host and guest, and both confirmation of formation of the complex and its stoichiometry, association constant (Kas) and degree of degradation were determined by NMR spectroscopy.
Once the cyclodextrin-sulphoraphane complex (CD-SFN) was formed, 1:1 stoichiometry of the inclusion complex was confirmed by Job's continuous variation method (Job, P. Annali di Chimica. 1928, 9, 113-203), using, as already mentioned, 1H spectroscopy as the method of evaluation.
The association constants of the complex formed by inclusion of the compound 16-R, in α-cyclodextrins (16-Rs-αCD) were measured by experiments for evaluation by 1H NMR in D2O. The association constants (Kas, M−1) at 298 K were determined experimentally by measuring the changes in chemical shift (Δδ, ppm) of the 1H NMR signals using fixed solutions of the analogues versus increasing concentrations of the CDs. In a typical evaluation experiment, a 4.16 mM solution of the analogue in D2O was prepared, a 500-μL aliquot was transferred to the NMR tube and the initial spectrum was recorded. A solution of CD was prepared (26.50 mM), adding 10-μL aliquots to the NMR tube so that the concentration of the analogue was kept constant. The amounts of CD added were increased until there was complete complexation of the sulphoraphane analogue, recording the 1H NMR spectra after each addition. Mathematical processing of the curves of the variations of chemical shift of the signals from the protons of the analogue (Δδ) versus the increasing values of concentration of CD using a least-squares method of iterative adjustment allowed the values of Kas to be determined.
For investigating the stability of the analogues complexed with CD, proton nuclear magnetic resonance was also employed for verifying the state of the sulphoraphane analogues in aqueous solution with the passage of time at room temperature in the presence and in the absence of cyclodextrins.
In all cases, the signal from the protons of the methyl group bound to the sulphinyl sulphur was taken as the reference for observing the process of degradation that the product undergoes. Checks were made at time zero and at forty days for all the sulphoraphanes ( FIG. 6 ).
