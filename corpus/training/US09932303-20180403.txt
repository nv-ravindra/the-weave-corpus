BACKGROUND
Nitroxyl (HNO) has been shown to have positive cardiovascular effects in in vitro and in vivo models of failing hearts. However, at physiological pH, nitroxyl dimerizes to hyponitrous acid, which subsequently dehydrates to nitrous oxide; due to this metastability, nitroxyl for therapeutic use must be generated in situ from donor compounds. A variety of compounds capable of donating nitroxyl have been described and proposed for use in treating disorders known or suspected to be responsive to nitroxyl. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,936,639; 7,696,373; 8,030,356; 8,268,890; 8,227,639; and 8,318,705 and U.S. pre-grant publication nos. 2009/0281067; 2009/0298795; 2011/0136827; and 2011/0144067. Although all of these compounds are capable of donating nitroxyl, they differ in various physicochemical properties, and there remains a need to identify nitroxyl donors that have physicochemical properties best suited for treating specific clinical conditions via specific routes of administration.
U.S. Pat. No. 8,030,056 describes the synthesis of derivatives of Piloty's Acid type compounds that are capable of donating nitroxyl under physiological conditions and are useful in treating heart failure and ischemia/reperfusion injury. The nitroxyl donor CXL-1020 (N-hydroxy-2-methanesulfonylbenzene-1-sulfonamide) has been evaluated in a Phase I safety study in healthy volunteers and in a Phase IIa placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study conducted at multiple hospitals. Sabbah et al., “Nitroxyl (HNO) a novel approach for the acute treatment of heart failure”, Circ Heart Fail., published online Oct. 9, 2013 (Online ISSN: 1941-3297, Print ISSN: 1941-3289). The studies demonstrated that in patients with systolic heart failure, CXL-1020, when administered intravenously as an aqueous solution at pH=4, reduced both left and right heart filling pressures and systemic vascular resistance, while increasing cardiac and stroke volume index. Hence, the studies demonstrated that CXL-1020 enhances myocardial function in human patients suffering from heart failure. However, at threshold doses of CXL-1020 needed to produce hemodynamic effects, the compound was found to induce side effects including unacceptable levels of inflammatory irritation at and distal to the intravenous insertion site, and the authors report that because of such side effects, this compound would not be a viable candidate for a human therapeutic.
Additionally, while nitroxyl donors for parenteral (e.g., intravenous) administration are currently being developed for clinical use, insufficient solid state stability of the donors has hampered the development of oral dosage forms.
Accordingly, there is a need to develop new nitroxyl donating compounds and compositions that are useful for the treatment of heart failure and that have a suitable safety profile. Moreover, there exists a need to develop nitroxyl donors that have enhanced solid state stability and that can be used for oral administration.

In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound in Table 1 can be utilized as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
Unexpectedly, it has been discovered that compounds falling within the scope of formulae (I), (II), (III) and (IV) (e.g., Compounds in Table 1) are sufficiently stable under solid state conditions and, thus, are amenable to oral administration. Moreover, particular compounds falling within the scope of formulae (I), (II), (III) and (IV) have a half-life of greater than about 10 minutes, e.g., when measured in dog human plasma in the presence of an anticoagulant (e.g., heparin or sodium citrate) at pH 7.4, in accordance with the procedure described in Example 24. It has been discovered that such compounds have a favorable toxiclogical profile.
Measuring Nitroxyl Donating Ability
Compounds are easily tested for nitroxyl donation by routine experiments. Although it is typically impractical to directly measure whether nitroxyl is donated, several analytical approaches are accepted as suitable for determining whether a compound donates nitroxyl. For example, the compound of interest can be placed in solution, for example in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or in a phosphate buffered solution at a pH of about 7.4, in a sealed container. After sufficient time for disassociation has elapsed, such as from several minutes to several hours, the headspace gas is withdrawn and analyzed to determine its composition, such as by gas chromatography and/or mass spectrometry. If the gas N2O is formed (which occurs by HNO dimerization), the test is positive for nitroxyl donation and the compound is deemed to be a nitroxyl donor.
The level of nitroxyl donating ability can be expressed as a percentage of a compound's theoretical stoichiometric maximum. A compound that donates a “significant level of nitroxyl” means, in various embodiments, a compound that donates about 40% or more, about 50% or more, about 60% or more, about 70% or more, about 80% or more, about 90% or more, or about 95% or more of its theoretical maximum amount of nitroxyl. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donor compound herein donates from about 70% to about 90% of its theoretical maximum amount of nitroxyl. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donor donates from about 85% to about 95% of its theoretical maximum amount of nitroxyl. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donor donates from about 90% to about 95% of its theoretical maximum amount of nitroxyl. N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donor compounds that donate less than about 40%, or less than about 50%, of their theoretical maximum amount of nitroxyl are still nitroxyl donors and can be used in the methods disclosed. A N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donor compound that donates less than about 50% of its theoretical amount of nitroxyl can be used in the methods disclosed, but may require higher dosing levels as compared to a compound that donates a higher level of nitroxyl.
If desired, nitroxyl donation also can be detected by exposing the test compound to metmyoglobin (Mb3+). See Bazylinski et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 107(26):7982-7986 (1985). Nitroxyl reacts with Mb3+ to form a Mb2+—NO complex, which can be detected by changes in the ultraviolet/visible spectrum or by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The Mb2+—NO complex has an EPR signal centered around a g-value of about 2. Nitric oxide, on the other hand, reacts with Mb3+ to form an Mb3+—NO complex that has a negligible, if any, EPR signal. Accordingly, if a compound reacts with Mb′ to form a complex detectable by common methods, such as ultraviolet/visible or EPR, then the test is positive for nitroxyl donation.
Testing for nitroxyl donation can be performed at a physiologically relevant pH. The N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compounds are capable of donating nitroxyl at physiological pH (i.e., a pH of about 7.4) and physiological temperature (i.e., a temperature of about 37° C.) (together, “physiological conditions”). In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate about 40% or more of its theoretical maximum (i.e., 100%) amount of nitroxyl under physiological conditions. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate about 50% or more of its theoretical maximum amount of nitroxyl under physiological conditions. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate about 60% or more of its theoretical maximum amount of nitroxyl under physiological conditions. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate about 70% or more of its theoretical maximum amount of nitroxyl under physiological conditions. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate about 80% or more of its theoretical maximum amount of nitroxyl under physiological conditions. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate about 90% or more of its theoretical maximum amount of nitroxyl under physiological conditions.
It will be understood that a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound might also donate a limited amount of nitric oxide, so long as the amount of nitroxyl donation exceeds the amount of nitric oxide donation. In certain embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate about 25 mole % or less of nitric oxide under physiological conditions. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate about 20 mole % or less of nitric oxide under physiological conditions. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate about 15 mole % or less of nitric oxide under physiological conditions. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate about 10 mole % or less of nitric oxide under physiological conditions. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donates about 5 mole % or less of nitric oxide under physiological conditions. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate about 2 mole % or less of nitric oxide under physiological conditions. In particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can donate an insignificant amount (e.g., about 1 mole % or less) of nitric oxide under physiological conditions.

The pharmaceutical compositions can be for immediate, sustained or controlled release.
In one particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated for intravenous administration. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated for intravenous administration by continuous infusion.
In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated for oral administration. Compounds for oral administration can be formulated as liquid or solid dosage forms. In particular embodiments where the N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compounds are formulated as oral liquid dosage forms, polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300) can usefully serve as an excipient.
The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein can be prepared as any appropriate unit dosage form, such as capsules, sachets, tablets, powder, granules, solution, suspension in an aqueous liquid, suspension in a non-aqueous liquid, oil-in-water liquid emulsion, water-in-oil liquid emulsion, liposomes or bolus.
Tablets can be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the therapeutic agent or agents in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets can be optionally coated or scored and can be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. Methods of formulating such slow or controlled release compositions of pharmaceutically active ingredients, such as the therapeutic agents herein and other compounds known in the art, are known in the art and disclosed in issued U.S. patents, some of which include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,369,174, 4,842,866, and the references cited therein. Coatings can be used for delivery of compounds to the intestine (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,638,534, 5,217,720, 6,569,457, and the references cited therein). An artisan will recognize that in addition to tablets, other dosage forms can be formulated to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient. Such dosage forms include, but are not limited to, capsules, granulations and gel-caps.
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical administration include, without limitation, lozenges comprising the ingredients in a flavored basis, such as sucrose, acacia and tragacanth; and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis or in an inert basis, such as gelatin and glycerin.
Various embodiments of pharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration include, without limitation, either aqueous sterile injection solutions or non-aqueous sterile injection solutions, each containing, for example, anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous sterile suspensions and non-aqueous sterile suspensions, each containing, for example, suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampules or vials, and can be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier, such as water, immediately prior to use.
Pharmaceutical compositions administered parenterally can be administered in an acidic, neutral or basic solution. In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions comprising a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can be formulated in an acidic solution having a pH of from about 4 to about 5, for instance, a pH of about 4, about 4.5, about 4.8, or about 5, including values there between. While a pH of about 4 has generally been considered optimal for formulating nitroxyl donating compositions to achieve adequate stability of the compound, it has been discovered that formulating under such acidic conditions can potentially cause or exacerbate venous irritation following parenteral administration. The amount of irritation can be attenuated by formulating the N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound in less acidic or even neutral solutions (see FIG. 4). Accordingly, in particular embodiments, a N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compound can be formulated for parenteral use at a pH of from about 5 to about 6.2 (e.g., pH of about 5, about 5.5, about 5.8, about 6, or about 6,2, including values there between).

Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury
In another embodiment, the disclosed subject matter provides a method of treating, preventing or delaying the onset and/or development of ischemia/reperfusion injury, comprising administering an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition as disclosed herein to a subject in need thereof.
In a particular embodiment, the method is for preventing ischemia/reperfusion injury. In a particular embodiment, a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure is administered prior to the onset of ischemia. In a particular embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure is administered prior to procedures in which myocardial ischemia can occur, for example an angioplasty or surgery, such as a coronary artery bypass graft surgery. In a particular embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure is administered after ischemia but before reperfusion. In a particular embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure is administered after ischemia and reperfusion.
In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure can be administered to a patient who is at risk for an ischemic event. In a particular embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure is administered to a patient at risk for a future ischemic event, but who has no present evidence of ischemia. The determination of whether a patient is at risk for an ischemic event can be performed by any method known in the art, such as by examining the patient or the patient's medical history. In a particular embodiment, the patient has had a prior ischemic event. Thus, the patient can be at risk of a first or subsequent ischemic event. Examples of patients at risk for an ischemic event include patients with known hypercholesterolemia, EKG changes associated with ischemia (e.g., peaked or inverted T-waves or ST segment elevations or depression in an appropriate clinical context), abnormal EKG not associated with active ischemia, elevated CKMB, clinical evidence of ischemia (e.g., crushing sub-sternal chest pain or arm pain, shortness of breath and/or diaphoresis), prior history of myocardial infarction, elevated serum cholesterol, sedentary lifestyle, angiographic evidence of partial coronary artery obstruction, echocardiographic evidence of myocardial damage, or any other evidence of a risk for a future ischemic event. Examples of ischemic events include, without limitation, myocardial infarction (MI) and neurovascular ischemia, such as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
In another embodiment, the subject of treatment is an organ that is to be transplanted. In a particular embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure can be administered prior to reperfusion of the organ in a transplant recipient. In a particular embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure can be administered prior to removal of the organ from the donor, for example through the perfusion cannulas used in the organ removal process. If the organ donor is a live donor, for example a kidney donor, the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure can be administered to the organ donor. In a particular embodiment, the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure are administered by storing the organ in a solution comprising the compound or pharmaceutical composition. For example, a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure can be included in the organ preservation solution, such as the University of Wisconsin “UW” solution, which is a solution comprising hydroxyethyl starch substantially free of ethylene glycol, ethylene chlorohydrin and acetone (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,798,824). In a particular embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure that is administered is such that ischemia/reperfusion injury to the tissues of the organ is reduced upon reperfusion in the recipient of transplanted organ. In a particular embodiment, the method reduces tissue necrosis (the size of infarct) in at-risk tissues.
Ischemia/reperfusion injury can damage tissues other than those of the myocardium and the disclosed subject matter embraces methods of treating or preventing such damage. In various embodiments, the ischemia/reperfusion injury is non-myocardial. In particular embodiments, the method reduces injury from ischemia/reperfusion in the tissue of the brain, liver, gut, kidney, bowel, or any part of the body other than the myocardium. In another embodiment, the patient is at risk for such injury. Selecting a person at risk for non-myocardial ischemia could include a determination of the indicators used to assess risk for myocardial ischemia. However, other factors can indicate a risk for ischemia/reperfusion in other tissues. For example, surgery patients often experience surgery related ischemia. Thus, patients scheduled for surgery could be considered at risk for an ischemic event. The following risk factors for stroke (or a subset of these risk factors) could demonstrate a patient's risk for ischemia of brain tissue: hypertension, cigarette smoking, carotid artery stenosis, physical inactivity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, past myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction with mural thrombus, and mitral stenosis. Ingall, Postgrad. Med. 107(6):34-50 (2000). Further, complications of untreated infectious diarrhea in the elderly can include myocardial, renal, cerebrovascular and intestinal ischemia. Slotwiner-Nie et al., Gastroenterol. Clin. N. Amer. 30(3):625-635 (2001). Alternatively, patients could be selected based on risk factors for ischemic bowel, kidney and/or liver disease. For example, treatment would be initiated in elderly patients at risk of hypotensive episodes (such as surgical blood loss). Thus, patients presenting with such an indication would be considered at risk for an ischemic event. In another embodiment, the patient has any one or more of the conditions listed herein, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Other conditions that can result in ischemia, such as cerebral arteriovenous malformation, could demonstrate a patient's risk for an ischemic event.

Nitroxyl Production as Determined Via N2O Quantification
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is produced via the dimerization and dehydration of HNO, and is the most common marker for nitroxyl production (Fukuto et al., Chem. Res. Toxicol. 18:790-801 (2005)). Nitroxyl, however, can also be partially quenched by oxygen to provide a product that does not produce N2O (see Mincione et al., J. Enzyme Inhibition 13:267-284 (1998); and Scozzafava et al., J. Med. Chem. 43:3677-3687 (2000)). Using either nitrous oxide gas or Angeli's salt (AS) as a standard, the relative amounts of N2O released from N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compounds was examined via gas chromatography (GC) headspace analysis.
A procedure for determining the relative amounts of N2O released from N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compounds is as follows. GC was performed on an Agilent gas chromatograph equipped with a split injector (10:1 splitting), microelectron capture detector, and a HP-MOLSIV 30 m×0.32 mm×25 μm molecular sieve capillary column. Helium was used as the carrier (4 mL/min) gas and nitrogen was used as the make-up (20 mL/min) gas. The injector oven and the detector oven were kept at 200° C. and 325° C., respectively. All nitrous oxide analyses were performed with the column oven held at a constant temperature of 200° C.
All gas injections were made using an automated headspace analyzer. Vial pressurization was 15 psi. The analyzer's sample oven, sampling valve, and transfer line were kept at 40° C., 45° C., and 50° C., respectively. The oven stabilization, vial pressurization, loop fill, loop equilibration, and sample injection times were 1.00 min., 0.20 min., 0.20 min., 0.05 min., and 1.00 min., respectively.
All determinations used a batch of nominal 20 mL headspace vials with volumes pre-measured for sample uniformity (actual vial volume varied by ≤2.0% relative standard deviation (n=6)). The average vial volume for the batch was determined from six randomly-selected vials by calculating the weight difference between the capped and sealed empty (i.e., air-filled) vial and the capped and sealed deionized water-filled vial using the known density of deionized water, then averaging. Blanks were prepared by sealing and capping two vials then purging each for 20 seconds with a gentle argon stream. Nitroxyl standards were prepared by sealing and capping four vials then purging each for 1 minute with a gentle stream, from a gas cylinder, of a 3000 ppm nitroxyl standard.
CXL-1020 (N-hydroxy-2-methanesulfonylbenzene-1-sulfonamide) “standards” were prepared by, in duplicate, accurately weighing 10±0.5 mg of CXL-1020 and adding it to each 4 mL vial. Using an auto pipette, 1 mL of argon-purged anhydrous DMF (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each 4 mL vial to form a CXL-1020 stock solution for each sample and the vials were capped and shaken and/or sonicated to insure complete dissolution upon visual observation. Using an auto pipette, 20 mL vials were charged with 5 mL of PBS (purged for at least 30 min. with argon prior to use), purged with argon for at least 20 sec., and sealed with a rubber septum. Using a 50 μL syringe, 50 μL of the CXL-1020 stock solution was injected into each 20 mL vial containing the PBS.
Samples were prepared as follows. In duplicate, 18±1 mg of each sample was accurately weighed into each 4 mL vial. Using an auto pipette, 1 mL of argon-purged anhydrous DMF was added to each 4 mL vial to form a sample stock solution for each sample and the vials were capped and shaken and/or sonicated to insure complete sample dissolution upon visual observation. Using an auto pipette, 20 mL vials were charged with 5 mL of PBS (purged for at least 30 min. with argon prior to use), purged with argon for at least 20 sec., and sealed with a rubber septum. The vials were equilibrated for at least 10 min. at 37° C. in a dry block heater. Thereafter, using a 50 μL syringe, 50 μL of a sample stock solution was injected into each 20 mL vial containing the PBS. The vials were then held at 37° C. in the dry block heater for a time period such that the sum of the time spent in the dry block heater plus the time spent in the automated headspace analyzer oven before sample injection equaled the desired incubation time.
The sequence for auto-injection was as follows: blank replicate 1, blank replicate 2, N2O standard replicate 1, N2O standard replicate 2, CXL-1020 standard replicate 1, CXL-1020 standard replicate 2, sample 1 replicate 1, sample 1 replicate 2, sample 2 replicate 1, sample 2 replicate 2, etc., concluding with N2O standard replicate 3, and N2O standard replicate 4. An EXCEL spreadsheet is used for inputting data thus determined and calculating, for each sample, the relative N2O yield in percent for each incubation time. The results obtained are provided in Table 2.  TABLE 2

hydroxymethanesulfonamide
Another procedure for determining the relative amounts of N2O released from N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compounds is as follows. GC is performed on a Varian CP-3800 instrument equipped with a 1041 manual injector, electron capture detector, and a 25 m 5 Å molecular sieve capillary column. Grade 5.0 nitrogen is used as both the carrier (8 mL/min) and the make-up (22 mL/min) gas. The injector oven and the detector oven are kept at 200° C. and 300° C., respectively. All nitrous oxide analyses are performed with the column oven held at a constant temperature of 150° C. All gas injections are made using a 100 μL gas-tight syringe with a sample-lock. Samples are prepared in 15 mL amber headspace vials with volumes pre-measured for sample uniformity (actual vial volume ranges from 15.19 to 15.20 mL). Vials are charged with 5 mL of PBS containing diethylenetriamine pentaacetic anhydride (DTPA), purged with argon, and sealed with a rubber septum. The vials are equilibrated for at least 10 minutes at 37° C. in a dry block heater. A 10 mM stock solution of AS is prepared in 10 mM sodium hydroxide, and solutions of the nitroxyl donors are prepared in either acetonitrile or methanol and used immediately after preparation. From these stock solutions, 50 μL is introduced into individual thermally-equilibrated headspace vials using a 100 μL gas-tight syringe with a sample-lock to provide final substrate concentrations of 0.1 mM. Substrates are then incubated for 90 minutes or 360 minutes. The headspace (60 μL) is then sampled and injected five successive times into the GC apparatus using the gas-tight syringe with a sample lock. This procedure is repeated for two or more vials per donor.

In Vitro Stability of N-Hydroxymethanesulfonamide Nitroxyl Donors in Plasma
Certain compounds from Table 1 were tested for their stability in plasma. The assay system comprised (i) PBS, or plasma from rat, dog or human (at least 3 donors, male, pooled) at pH 7.4, and (ii) for tests conducted in plasma, an anticoagulant (sodium heparin or sodium citrate). Each test compound (5 μM) was incubated in PBS or plasma at 37° C. on a THERMOMIXER® with shaking Three samples (n=3) were taken at each of seven sampling time points: 0, 10, 30, 60, 90, 180 and 360 minutes. The samples were immediately combined with 3 volumes (i.e., 3 times the volume of PBS or plasma) of acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid and an internal standard to terminate the reaction. AB SCIEX API 3000 LC-MS/MS analysis of the test compounds was performed without a standard curve. Half-lives (T1/2) of the test compounds were determined from graphs of the percent remaining values using the peak area response ratio. The half-lives determined are provided in Table 3.  TABLE 3

Solubility of N-Hydroxymethanesulfonamide Nitroxyl Donors
The solubilities of the N-hydroxymethanesulfonamide nitroxyl donating compounds are measured by visual assessment at 100 μg/mL and 1000 μg/mL in a pH 4 buffer. The buffer is prepared by mixing 660 mL of Solution A (10.5023 g of citric acid dissolved in 1 L of water) and 450 mL of Solution B (14.7010 g of sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate dissolved in 1 L of water). The pH of the buffer is about 4 as measured by pH meter.
Each compound is shaken for about 5 minutes in the pH 4 buffer solution prepared above at two concentration points (100 μg/mL and 1000 μg/mL) and the solubility is observed visually.
Additionally, a sample of a compound of the disclosure are prepared in water to determine the approximate solubility of the compound in the absence of excipients (e.g., CAPTISOL®).
