FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to compounds that inhibit lysine-specific demethylase one (LSD1). In particular, the present invention relates to compounds that irreversibly inhibit the activity of LSD1, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use therefor.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Lysine-specific demethylase one (“LSD1”), also known as KDM1A, is a flavin-dependent lysine demethylase that removes methyl groups from mono- and dimethylated lysine4 of the histone H3 protein through flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) dependent enzymatic oxidation (e.g., see Shi et al., (2004) Cell 119:941-953). In addition, LSD1 demethylates mono- and dimethylation of histone H3 lysine9 in prostate cancer cell lines and is essential for transcriptional regulation mediated by the androgen receptor (Metzger et al., Nature (2005) 437:436-439). LSD1 also demethylates a number of cellular proteins, such as p53, E2F1 and STAT3 and regulates their function.
LSD1 has been reported to be overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers and tissues, including lung cancer, bladder cancer, neuroblastoma, prostate cancer and breast cancer. LSD1 is thought to play a role in cellular proliferation and cancer cell growth by modulating prosurvival gene expression and p53 transcriptional activity (e.g., see Suzuki and Miyata (2011) J. Med. Chem. 54:8236-8250). LSD1 also plays a role in regulating viral gene transcription, e.g., Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), by demethylating histone H3 lysine9 required for viral gene expression in the host.
With increasing evidence that LSD1 plays a critical role in a diverse set of cancers and diseases, a variety of LSD1 inhibitors, including irreversible LSD1 inhibitors, have been reported and are in clinical development. Irreversible cyclopropyl amine-containing inhibitors, e.g., reviewed in Suzuki and Miyata, ibid, have been shown to be potent inhibitors of the LSD1 enzyme; however, such compounds tend to lack robust cellular potency, have poor metabolic stability and high clearance in vivo.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present inventors recognized a need to develop new LSD1 inhibitors that demonstrate improved cellular potency, efficacy, stability and safety. The compounds and compositions of the present invention advantageously overcome one or more of these shortcomings by providing potent, selective and orally active LSD1 inhibitors.
In one aspect of the invention, compounds are provided that irreversibly inhibit LSD1 activity. In certain embodiments, the compounds are represented by formula (I):

Definitions
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents, patent applications, and publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference to the extent they are consistent with the present disclosure. Terms and ranges have their generally defined definition unless expressly defined otherwise.
For simplicity, chemical moieties are defined and referred to throughout primarily as univalent chemical moieties (e.g., alkyl, aryl, etc.). Nevertheless, such terms may also be used to convey corresponding multivalent moieties under the appropriate structural circumstances clear to those skilled in the art. For example, while an “alkyl” moiety generally refers to a monovalent radical (e.g. CH3—CH2—), in certain circumstances a bivalent linking moiety can be “alkyl,” in which case those skilled in the art will understand the alkyl to be a divalent radical (e.g., —CH2—CH2—), which is equivalent to the term “alkylene.” (Similarly, in circumstances in which a divalent moiety is required and is stated as being “aryl,” those skilled in the art will understand that the term “aryl” refers to the corresponding divalent moiety, arylene.) All atoms are understood to have their normal number of valences for bond formation (i.e., 4 for carbon, 3 for N, 2 for 0, and 2, 4, or 6 for S, depending on the oxidation state of the S).

Pharmaceutical Compositions
In another aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a LSD1 inhibitor according to the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, or diluent. Compounds of the invention may be formulated by any method well known in the art and may be prepared for administration by any route, including, without limitation, parenteral, oral, sublingual, transdermal, topical, intranasal, intratracheal, or intrarectal. In certain embodiments, compounds of the invention are administered intravenously in a hospital setting. In certain other embodiments, administration may preferably be by the oral route.
The characteristics of the carrier will depend on the route of administration. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means a non-toxic material that is compatible with a biological system such as a cell, cell culture, tissue, or organism, and that does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient(s). Thus, compositions according to the invention may contain, in addition to the inhibitor, diluents, fillers, salts, buffers, stabilizers, solubilizers, and other materials well known in the art. The preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable formulations is described in, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, ed. A. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990.
As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to salts that retain the desired biological activity of the above-identified compounds and exhibit minimal or no undesired toxicological effects. Examples of such salts include, but are not limited to acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids (for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and the like), and salts formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, pamoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acid, and polygalacturonic acid. The compounds can also be administered as pharmaceutically acceptable quaternary salts known by those skilled in the art, which specifically include the quaternary ammonium salt of the formula —NR+Z—, wherein R is hydrogen, alkyl, or benzyl, and Z is a counterion, including chloride, bromide, iodide, —O-alkyl, toluenesulfonate, methylsulfonate, sulfonate, phosphate, or carboxylate (such as benzoate, succinate, acetate, glycolate, maleate, malate, citrate, tartrate, ascorbate, benzoate, cinnamoate, mandeloate, benzyloate, and diphenylacetate).
The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent in an amount sufficient to deliver to a patient a therapeutically effective amount without causing serious toxic effects in the patient treated. A dose of the active compound for all of the above-mentioned conditions is in the range from about 0.01 to 300 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 100 mg/kg per day, more generally 0.5 to about 25 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day. A typical topical dosage will range from 0.01-3% wt/wt in a suitable carrier. The effective dosage range of the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives can be calculated based on the weight of the parent compound to be delivered. If the derivative exhibits activity in itself, the effective dosage can be estimated as above using the weight of the derivative, or by other means known to those skilled in the art.
The pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of the present invention may be used in the methods described herein.
Methods of Use
In yet another aspect, the invention provides for methods for inhibiting LSD1 activity in a cell, comprising contacting the cell in which inhibition of LSD1 activity is desired with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or pharmaceutical compositions containing the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
The compositions and methods provided herein are particularly deemed useful for inhibiting LSD1 activity in a cell. In one embodiment, a cell in which inhibition of LSD1 activity is desired is contacted with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) to negatively modulate the activity of LSD1.

REACTION SCHEMES AND EXAMPLES
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared using commercially available reagents using the synthetic methods and reaction schemes described herein, or using other reagents and conventional methods well known to those skilled in the art.
For instance, compounds of the present invention may be prepared according to the general reaction schemes I-V.
Schemes Ia and Ib illustrate preparation of compounds of formula (I) or formula (II), respectively, wherein W is NR4 or O, (or Y is S, SO, or SO2) and L is an epichlorohydrin derivative. The epichlorihydrin A undergoes substitution with nucleophile W—R5 to afford intermediate B (Step 1). The substitution proceeds in solvents such as MeCN in the presence of a base such as K2CO3, typically at an elevated temperature. In the case where Y is SO or SO2, the initial substitution with a nucleophile of the form R6SH will be followed by oxidation to the sulfoxide or sulfone derivative yielding Y—R6. Reaction of B with amines C affords compounds D (Step 2). The epoxide ring opening also typically proceeds under conditions similar to Step 1. Removal of the protecting group in Step 3 to afford compounds E typically proceeds with an acid such as TFA in a solvent such as DCM.
Schemes IIa and IIb illustrate preparation of compounds of formula (I) and formula (II), respectively, wherein W is NR4 or O, (or Y is S, SO or SO2), and L is an alkyl derivative. Reagent F undergoes substitution with nucleophile W—R5 to afford intermediate G (Step 1). The substitution proceeds in solvents such as acetone in the presence of a base such as K2CO3. In the case where Y is SO or SO2, the initial substitution with a nucleophile of the form R6SH will be followed by oxidation to the sulfoxide or sulfone derivative yielding Y—R6. Reaction of G with amines C affords compounds H (Step 2). This substitution typically proceeds under conditions similar to Step 1. Alternative bases and solvents such as Cs2CO3 and MeCN may also be effective. Removal of the protecting group in Step 3 to afford compounds I typically proceeds with an acid such as TFA in a solvent such as DCM.
Scheme IIIa and Scheme IIIb illustrate preparation of compounds of formula (I) and formula (II), respectively, wherein Y is NR4SO2 or NR4C(O). Intermediate C undergoes alkylation with a nitrile derivative, which is subsequently reduced to afford free amines J. In one case, alkylation with, for example, chloromethyl acetonitrile in a solvent such as acetone with a base such as K2CO3 would afford an intermediate that could be reduced to give the amine where L is —CH2CH2—. Alternatively, amines J could arise from the alkylation of intermediates C with a protected amine derivative. Functionalization of amines J would give rise to derivatives K, which would give targets L upon deprotection. The functionalization of K would proceed, for example, by reaction with sulfonyl or acyl chlorides. Removal of the Boc protecting group in the final step proceeds with acids such as TFA in solvents such as DCM.
Schemes IVa and IVb illustrate preparation of compounds of formula (I) and formula (II), respectively, wherein Y is SO2NR4. Intermediate C undergoes addition, for example with a vinyl sulfonamide derivative M, to afford compounds N. Removal of the Boc protecting group in the final step proceeds with acids such as TFA in solvents such as DCM to afford derivatives O.
Schemes Va and Vb illustrate preparation of compounds of formula (I) and formula (II), respectively, wherein Y is —CO—. Intermediate C is alkylated with a halogen derivative P and the ester is cleaved to afford carboxylic acids S. This substitution proceeds in a solvent such as DMF with a base such as TEA and potassium iodide. Removal of the ester group occurs with a base such as NaOH in a solvent such as THF. Amide bond formation with a species R6 followed by removal of the protecting group affords compounds T. The amidation using R6 reaction proceeds, for example, in dichloromethane with EDC/HOBt. Removal of the Boc group proceeds, for example, with a dilute solution of HCl in dioxane.

Alternatively, compounds of the present invention may be synthesized using optically pure, chiral reagents and intermediates to prepare individual isomers or entantiomers as described, for example, in Examples 7 & 8. Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) and racemic forms are within the scope of the invention.
Example A
This Example illustrates that exemplary compounds of the present invention inhibit LSD1 enzymatic activity.
Ten-point dose-response curves for compounds shown in Table 3 were determined using a fluorescence coupling enzymatic assay using purified N-terminal truncated human LSD1 enzyme (aa 151-852; Genbank Accession No NM015013) containing an N-terminal His-Tag (Reaction Biology Corp). In this assay, hydrogen peroxide is produced by the LSD1 FAD-dependent demethylase activity using a horseradish peroxidase/Amplex Red coupling reaction resulting in the production of highly fluorescent compound, Resorufin, which is detected at 590 nM.
Briefly, compounds of the present invention were solubilized in DMSO and a series of 10, three-fold serial dilutions were made for each compound in 15% DMSO. The initial starting concentration for the serial dilutions of each compound was 10 μM. Control samples lacking compound, LSD1 enzyme or various reaction components also were prepared and processed in parallel with compound test samples.
An aliquot of each serial dilution of test compound was added to a 96 well plate containing 50 nM purified N-truncated LSD1 enzyme (RBC Cat# PDM-11-350), 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% CHAPS and 1% DMSO in a 10 microliter reaction volume. The plate was pre-incubated at room temperature for 30 min to which 10 M of histone 3.3 peptide (aa 1-21) was added to initiate the enzymatic reaction. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for one hour. After one hour, 10 μl of a detection mixture of horseradish peroxidase (Sigma Cat #P8375) and Amplex Red (InVitrogen A36006) was added and kinetic measurements were read at 5 minute intervals for a period of 30 minutes using an Envision Multiplate Reader (PerkinElmer; excitation at 535 nM and emmission read at 590 nM). The IC50 value for each compound was determined from each 10-point dose-response curve using GraphPad Prism 4 software with a sigmodial dose response. The results for exemplary compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (II) are shown in Table 3.  TABLE 3

Example B
This Example illustrates that exemplary compounds of the present invention inhibit the growth of tumor cell lines that express LSD1.
The MV4-11 cell line cell line was established from the blast cells of a 10-year-old male with biphenotypic B-myelomonocytic leukemia. This cell line expresses a leukemic fusion protein (MLL-AF9+), LSD1 and has been shown to be sensitive to inhibitors of LSD1.
Inhibition of LSD1-mediated cellular proliferation by compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) was measured in a CellTiter Glo luminescence assay (Promega Corp), which determines the number of viable cells by quantitating the amount of ATP, using a BMG LabTech CLARIOStar instrument in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MV4-11 cells were plated at a density of 1000 cells/90 μl/well in 96 well culture plates and cultured in IMDM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin at 37° C. A series of 3-fold serial dilutions of each test compound of Formula (I) was prepared in IMDM medium lacking FBS and added to the cells at final concentrations ranging from 1 μM to 0.01 nM. Control samples lacking test compound or cells were processed in parallel. The plates were incubated at 37° C. for four days and thereafter 50 μl fresh medium containing the same concentration of test compound was added. The plates were incubated for an additional three days (Day 7). A baseline measurement, as described below, was taken for a time zero point at Day 0.
At Day 7, the supernatant was removed by aspiration and the plate was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature (˜15 min). The cells were lysed using 45 μl (30 μl for Day 0) of Cell Titer Glo reagent (Promega Corp). The plates were shaken for two minutes and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The degree of inhibition of cell viability was determined using a spectrophotometric readout by measuring the luminescence at 340 nm and the EC50 concentration for each compound was calculated using Graph Pad Prism 4 software. The results are shown in Table 4. Key: N/D=not determined.  TABLE 4
