CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
This application is the national stage of International Application No. PCT/EP2015/062691, filed internationally on Jun. 8, 2015, which claims the benefit of European Application No. 14172037.5, filed Jun. 11, 2014, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes.
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing 3,5-bis(haloalkyl)pyrazole derivatives.
Polyfluoroalkylpyrazolylcarboxylic acid derivatives and 3,5-bis(haloalkyl)pyrazoles are valuable precursors of active fungicidal ingredients (WO 2003/070705, WO 2008/013925, WO 2012/025557).
Pyrazolecarboxylic acid derivatives are typically prepared by reacting acrylic acid derivatives having two leaving groups with hydrazines (WO 2009/112157 and WO 2009/106230). WO 2005/042468 discloses a process for preparing 2-dihaloacyl-3-aminoacrylic esters by reacting acid halides with dialkylaminoacrylic esters and subsequent cyclization thereof with alkyl hydrazines. WO 2008/022777 describes a process for preparing 3-dihalomethylpyrazole-4-carboxylic acid derivatives by reacting α,α-difluoroamines in the presence of Lewis acids with acrylic acid derivatives and subsequent reaction thereof with alkylhydrazines.
3,5-Bis(fluoroalkyl)pyrazoles are prepared by reacting bisperfluoroalkyl diketones (e.g. 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoroacetylacetone) with hydrazines (cf. Pashkevich et al., Zhurnal Vsesoyuznogo Khimicheskogo Obshchestva im. D. I. Mendeleeva (1981), 26(1), 105-7), the yield being only 27-40%. The synthesis, isolation and purification of the polyfluoroalkyl diketones is very complex since the compounds are generally very volatile and highly toxic.
In the light of the prior art described above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a process that does not have the aforementioned disadvantages and hence gives a route to 3,5-bis(haloalkyl)pyrazole derivatives in high yields.
The object described above was achieved by a process for preparing 3,5 -bis(haloalkyl)pyrazoles of the formula (I), in which
R1 and R3 are each independently selected from C1-C6-haloalkyl;
R2 is selected from H, halogen, COOH, (C═O)OR5, CN and (C═O)NR6R7;

R2 is selected from H, F, Cl, Br, COOCH3, COOC2H5, COOC3H7, CN and CON(CH3)2, CON(C2H5)2;

Preferred compounds of the general formula (II) are Trifluoracetylchloride, Trifluoracetylfluoriede, Difluoracetylfluoride, Difluoroacetylchloride, Trifluorocetylbromide. It is also possible to generate compound of formula (II) in situ for instance using Trfufluoroacetic acid, pivaloyl chloride and pyridine (see WO 2003/051820).

For the process according to the invention 1 to 2 mol, preferably 1 to 1.5 mol, most preferably 1 to 1.2 mol of the acid derivatives of the formula (II) is reacted with 1 mol of compounds of formula (III).
Suitable solvents are, for example, aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons, for example petroleum ether, n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene or decalin, and halogenated hydrocarbons, for example chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethane or trichloroethane, ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, methyl tert-amyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane or anisole; nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, n- or isobutyronitrile or benzonitrile; amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylformanilide, N-methylpyrrolidone or hexamethylphosphoramide; sulphoxides such as dimethyl sulphoxide or sulphones such as sulpholane. Particular preference is given, for example, to THF, acetonitriles, ethers, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, n-hexane, cyclohexane or methylcyclohexane, and very particular preference, for example, Dichloromethane, ether or dichloromethane. The intermediates of the formula (V) formed can be used in the cyclization step without prior workup.
Alternatively, the intermediates can be isolated by suitable workup steps, characterized and optionally further purified.
Compounds of formula (III) can be prepared from aldehydes or ketones of formula (V) according to the scheme shown below:
The reaction of compounds of formula (V) (in which the radicals are as defined above) and compounds of formula (VI) (in which the radicals are as defined above) is effected at temperatures of −40° C. to +120° C., preferably at temperatures of +20° C. to +100° C., more preferably at 20° C. to +60° C. and under standard pressure.
For this process 0.9 to 1.8 mol, preferably 1 to 1.6 mol, most preferably 1 to 1.4 mol of the compound of the formula (V) is reacted with 1 mol of the compound of the formula (VI).
It is preferred to have a ratio of 1:1.
The reaction time is not critical and may, according to the batch size and temperature, be selected within a range between a few and many hours. The typical reaction time is 1-5 h.
Suitable solvents are, for example, aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons, for example petroleum ether, n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene or decalin, and halogenated hydrocarbons, for example chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethane or trichloroethane, ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, methyl tert-amyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane or anisole; nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, n- or isobutyronitrile or benzonitrile; amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylformanilide, N-methylpyrrolidone or hexamethylphosphoramide; sulphoxides such as dimethyl sulphoxide or sulphones such as sulpholane, alkohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanolm butanol.

The reaction time is not critical and may, according to the batch size, be selected within a relatively wide range.
Typically, the cyclization step (B) is effected without changing the solvent.
Typically the cyclization of compound of the formula (IV) proceeds under acidic condition.
Preference is given to mineral acids, for example H2SO4, HCl, HF, HBr, HI, H3PO4 or organic acids, for example CH3COOH, CF3COOH, p-toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid. 0.1 mol to 2 mol, preferably 0.1 to 1.5 mol of the acid for 1 mol of the compound of formula (IV) is used.
Suitable solvents are, for example, aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons, for example petroleum ether, n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene or decalin, and halogenated hydrocarbons, for example chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethane or trichloroethane, ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, methyl tert-amyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane or anisole; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or butanol, nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, n- or isobutyronitrile or benzonitrile; amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylformanilide, N-methylpyrrolidone or hexamethylphosphoramide; sulphoxides such as dimethyl sulphoxide or sulphones such as sulpholane. Particular preference is given, for example, to acetonitrilestoluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, n-hexane, cyclohexane or methylcyclohexane, and very particular preference, for example, to acetonitriles, THF, toluene or xylene. After the reaction has ended, for example, the solvents are removed and the product is isolated by filtration, or the product is first washed with water and extracted, the organic phase is removed and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure.
The compounds of the formula (I) where R2 equals (C═O)OR5 can then be converted to pyrazole acids of the formula (I) where R2 equals COOH.
Amine (IV) can be reused for the preparation of compound (III). Alternatively, it is trapped by washing the reaction mixture with acid.

Solution of 1-(1,1-Difluoropropan-2-ylidene)-2-(diphenylmethylene)hydrazine 2.2 g (7.5 mmol) and 1.2 g Pyridine in 50 ml of Dichloromethane was cooled to 0° C. 19.5 g of Difluoroacetic acid anhydride was added portionwise at this temperature under intensive stirring and the mixture was finally stirred at 10° C. for 6 h. 50 ml water were added and CH2Cl phase was separated and washed 2 times with water, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuum to give pale yellow oil which slowly solidify.
Analytical data confirm the structure.
