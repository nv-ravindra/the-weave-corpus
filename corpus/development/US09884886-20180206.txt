FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to disulfide masked prodrug compounds, compositions and methods that are amenable to bioactivation by a reducing agent such as glutathione. Such disulfide based compounds, compositions, and methods can be useful, for example, in providing novel prodrugs for use as therapeutics.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The following is a discussion of relevant art pertaining to certain prodrug compositions. The discussion is provided only for understanding of the invention that follows. The summary is not an admission that any of the work described below is prior art to the claimed invention.
The fields of medicinal chemistry and biotechnology have yielded a multitude of biologically active compounds having well demonstrated in vitro activity. These compounds, however, need to be effectively delivered to target cells and tissues of interest in order to be useful as research tools or as therapeutic agents in vivo. Many biologically active molecules have in vivo activity profiles that are compromised by virtue of their net negative (anionic) charge, their size, or a combination of both anionic charge and size. Furthermore, the polyanionic backbone of oligonucleotide compounds is recognized by nucleases that rapidly degrade these molecules. Various strategies have been developed in an attempt to overcome these barriers. In the case of oligonucleotide delivery, both viral and non-viral delivery strategies have yielded mixed results, with most having dose limiting toxicity or other safety issues. Such safety issues are representative of the challenge faced in effectively delivering other charged molecules to cells and tissues of interest. These challenges have driven innovation in a divergent approach, that of the prodrug.
A prodrug is a pharmacological substance administered in an inactive or significantly less active form. Once administered, the prodrug is metabolised in vivo into an active metabolite in a process termed bioactivation. The rationale behind the use of a prodrug is generally for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) optimization. Anion masking produgs represent a new platform of compounds that provide the advantage of improving ADME properties through a variety of mechanisms. First, the anion masking prodrug neutralizes anionic charge, and therefore overcomes barriers of cellular adsorption and tissue distribution. Second, because certain nucleases rely upon anionic charge to identify their substrates, the anion masking prodrug can circumvent metabolism. Furthermore, the charge masking moiety of the prodrug can also serve as a scaffold for various chemical entities that can confer improved targeting, immunosuppression, or solubility profiles. All of these factors can lead to improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a compound or molecule of interest.
Examples of anion masking phosphotriester protecting groups have been disclosed, see for example Lebleu et al., (2000), Russ. J. Bioorg. Chem., 26, 174-182. However, this approach utilizes ultraviolet radiation for deprotection and thus is not amenable to use in vivo. Beaucage et al. (2007), J. Org. Chem., 72, 805-815 describes in vivo bioactivation of certain phosphotriester oligonucleotide prodrugs. However, this approach generates THF as a byproduct upon bioconversion. WO 2010/039543 describes certain anion masking disulfide phosphotriester oligonucleotide prodrugs. Nevertheless, cyclodeesterification of these disulfide prodrugs results in the release of a reactive thiirane species, which can limit the use of such prodrugs due to dose limiting toxicity.
Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide that contains an unusual peptide linkage between the amine group of cysteine, which is attached by normal peptide linkage, to a glycine and the carboxyl group of the glutamate side-chain. Glutathione is an important antioxidant, preventing damage to cellular components caused by reactive oxygen species such as free radicals and peroxides. Glutathione thiol groups are reducing agents, existing at a concentration of approximately 5 mM in cells. Glutathione reduces disulfide bonds formed within cytoplasmic proteins to cysteines by serving as an electron donor. In the process, glutathione is converted to its oxidized form glutathione disulfide (GSSG), which is also called L(−)-Glutathione. Once oxidized, glutathione can be reduced back by glutathione reductase, using NADPH as an electron donor. Glutathione is therefore an attractive bioconversion reducing agent for prodrugs.
Certain examples of glutathione activated prodrugs are disclosed in, for example, Gunnarsdottir et al., (2003), Drug Metabolism and Disposition, 32, 321-327 and Tirouvanziam et al., (2006), PNAS, 103, 12, 4628-4633. These glutathione activiated prodrugs, however, do not offer any anionic charge masking capabilities. Accordingly, there exists a need for improved anion masking prodrugs that are amenable to bioconversion in vivo.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention provides a solution to the problem of providing glutathione activated prodrug compositions and methods that are capable of masking anionic charge and that do not result in the formation of a reactive species upon bioconversion.
Disclosed herein are prodrug compounds and compositions and methods of making and using the same. The prodrug compounds, compositions and methods of the invention feature a conformationally restricted disulfide phosphotriester moiety to mask anionic charge. The conformationally restricted disulfide phosphotriester moiety can also serve as a scaffold to attach a helper molecule, such as targeting moieties, immunnosuppression moieties, solubility enhancing moieties etc. The conformationally restricted disulfide phosphotriester moiety undergoes charge dissipation driven cyclodeesterification via glutathione mediated reduction/bioconversion to release the active anionic molecule of interest and eject any helper moiety during the bioconversion process. During bioconversion, the reactive thiirane species is internally quenched via a intramolecular 1,5-exo-tet ring closure to produce stable tetrahydrothiophenes. The disulfide phosphotriester moiety of the invention can provide charge masked prodrug analogs of nucleic acids, polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, peptides, polypeptides, proteins, antibodies, hormones, small molecules, antivirals and other biologically active molecules as are known in the art.

Aerosols and Delivery Devices
a. Aerosol Formulations
The compounds of the present invention, either alone or in combination with other suitable components, may be made into aerosol formulations (i.e., they may be “nebulized”) to be administered via inhalation (e.g., intranasally or intratracheally) (see, Brigham et al., Am. J. Sci., 298:278 (1989)). Aerosol formulations may be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like.
In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention and formulations thereof are administered via pulmonary delivery, such as by inhalation of an aerosol or spray dried formulation administered by an inhalation device or nebulizer, providing rapid local uptake of the nucleic acid molecules into relevant pulmonary tissues. Solid particulate compositions containing respirable dry particles of micronized compounds may be prepared by grinding dried or lyophilized compositions, and then passing the micronized composition through, for example, a 400 mesh screen to break up or separate out large agglomerates. A solid particulate composition comprising the compounds of the invention may optionally contain a dispersant which serves to facilitate the formation of an aerosol as well as other therapeutic compounds. A suitable dispersant is lactose, which may be blended with the compound in any suitable ratio, such as a 1 to 1 ratio by weight.
Spray compositions comprising compounds or compositions of the invention may, for example, be formulated as aqueous solutions or suspensions or as aerosols delivered from pressurized packs, such as a metered dose inhaler, with the use of a suitable liquefied propellant. In one embodiment, aerosol compositions of the invention suitable for inhalation may be either a suspension or a solution and generally contain an compound of the invention and a suitable propellant such as a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon or mixtures thereof, particularly hydrofluoroalkanes, especially 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane or a mixture thereof. The aerosol composition may optionally contain additional formulation excipients well known in the art such as surfactants. Non-limiting examples include oleic acid, lecithin or an oligolactic acid or derivative such as those described in WO94/21229 and WO98/34596 and co-solvents for example ethanol. In one embodiment a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation of the invention comprising a compound of the invention and a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon or mixtures thereof as propellant, optionally in combination with a surfactant and/or a co-solvent.
The aerosol formulations of the invention may be buffered by the addition of suitable buffering agents.
Aerosol formulations may include optional additives including preservatives if the formulation is not prepared sterile. Non-limiting examples include, methyl hydroxybenzoate, anti-oxidants, flavorings, volatile oils, buffering agents and emulsifiers and other formulation surfactants. In one embodiment, fluorocarbon or perfluorocarbon carriers are used to reduce degradation and provide safer biocompatible non-liquid particulate suspension compositions of the invention. In another embodiment, a device comprising a nebulizer delivers a composition of the invention comprising fluorochemicals that are bacteriostatic thereby decreasing the potential for microbial growth in compatible devices. Capsules and cartridges comprising the composition of the invention for use in an inhaler or insufflator, of for example gelatin, may be formulated containing a powder mix for inhalation of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. In one embodiment, each capsule or cartridge contains a compound of the invention and one or more excipients. In another embodiment, the compound of the invention may be presented without excipients such as lactose
The aerosol compositions of the present invention may be administered into the respiratory system as a formulation including particles of respirable size, e.g. particles of a size sufficiently small to pass through the nose, mouth and larynx upon inhalation and through the bronchi and alveoli of the lungs. In general, respirable particles range from about 0.5 to 10 microns in size. In one embodiment, the particulate range may be from 1 to 5 microns. In another embodiment, the particulate range may be from 2 to 3 microns. Particles of non-respirable size which are included in the aerosol tend to deposit in the throat and be swallowed, and the quantity of non-respirable particles in the aerosol is thus minimized. For nasal administration, a particle size in the range of 10-500 um is preferred to ensure retention in the nasal cavity.
In some embodiments, compounds of the invention are administered topically to the nose for example, for the treatment of rhinitis, via pressurized aerosol formulations, aqueous formulations administered to the nose by pressurized pump or by nebulization. Suitable formulations may contain water as the diluent or carrier for this purpose. In certain embodiments, the aqueous formulations for administration of the composition of the invention to the lung or nose may be provided with conventional excipients such as buffering agents, tonicity modifying agents and the like.
b. Devices
The compounds of the invention may be formulated and delivered as particles and/or aerosols as discussed above and dispensed from various aerosolization devices known by those of skill in the art.
Aerosols of liquid or non-liquid particles comprising a compound or formulation of the invention may be produced by any suitable means, such as with a device comprising a nebulizer (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,729) such as ultrasonic or air jet nebulizers.
Solid particle aerosols comprising a compound or formulation of the invention and surfactant may be produced with any solid particulate aerosol generator. One type of solid particle aerosol generator used with the compounds of the invention is an insufflator. A second type of illustrative aerosol generator comprises a metered dose inhaler (“MDI”). MDIs containing compounds or formulations taught herein may be prepared by methods of the art (for example, see Byron, above and WO96/32099).
The compounds may also be formulated as a fluid formulation for delivery from a fluid dispenser, such as those described and illustrated in WO05/044354.
In certain embodiments of the invention, nebulizer devices are used in applications for conscious, spontaneously breathing subjects, and for controlled ventilated subjects of all ages. The nebulizer devices may be used for targeted topical and systemic drug delivery to the lung. In one embodiment, a device comprising a nebulizer is used to deliver a compound or formulation of the invention locally to lung or pulmonary tissues. In another embodiment, a device comprising a nebulizer is used to deliver a compound or formulation of the invention systemically.
E. Examples
The invention will now be illustrated with the following non-limiting examples. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non-critical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results.
Oligonucleotide based medicines have the opportunity to provide several new treatment platforms to address a variety of diseases and conditions that currently have unmet medical need. By conferring the ability to selectively modulate gene expression, i.e. by directly down-regulating or up-regulating genes of interest, oligonucleotide medicines are uniquely poised for changing the face of modern medicine. However, because oligonucleotides are labile polyanionic macromolecules with only limited capability to cross cell membranes, their development into successful drugs has been contingent on safe and effective delivery approaches. Moreover, oligonucleotides are readily metabolized into shorter oligonucleotides and ultimately nucleotides by the action of naturally occurring enzymes (endo- and exo-nucleases). To address this shortcoming, the phosphodiester backbone is often modified by inclusion of phosphothiotes, or with modification of the nucleotide sugar or base portion(s). Also, unmodified oligonucleotides can posses strong immunogenic properties, and extensive chemical modification of the sugar/phosphodiester backbone may be needed to abbrogate this action. However, these chemical alterations can often alter the inherent potency of oligonucleotide based therapeutics.
Conversion of the naturally occurring phosphodiester linkage to a biolabile phosphotriester offers an elegant solution to the problems described above. According to this approach, the oligonucleotide prodrug remains protected against nuclease induced cleavage while in transit to the target cell/tissue. After entering the target cells, the biolabile bond contained within the phosphotriester group is broken via a site-specific mechanism releasing the biologically active oligonucleotide molecule.
The naturally reductive environment of the cytoplasm can serve as a suitable release trigger, and a disulfide moiety present within the phosphotriester can serve as a biolabile linker. Moreover, since the disulfide moiety is readily reduced only in alkaline pH (such as that of the cytoplasm), these constructs are expected to be stable in endosomes/lysosomes as the pH of these compartments is typically mildly acidic.
The principle of the oligomer release is exemplified in Scheme 1. According to this example, the initial cleavage of a disulfide bond contained within a phosphotriester group of a oligonucleotide (1-1) can produce the unstable intermediate 1-2, which is expected to undergo a spontaneous, charge-dissipation driven cyclodeesterification to produce the bioactive nucleic acid molecule/oligonucleotide (1-4) and thiirane (1-3).
The cyclodeesterification of 1-2 described in Scheme 1 is a spontaneous process and is expected to take place irrespective of the manner in which species 1-2 was produced. For example, S-acyl-2-thioethyl (SATE) prodrugs of oligonucleotides described by Petersen (WO 2010039543 A2, 2010, Traversa Therapeutics) are capable of producing the unstable intermediate 1-2 via an esterase-mediated hydrolysis of triesters such as 1-5, Scheme 1.
In spite of its elegance, the mechanism as described in Scheme 1 has inherent limitations. For example, linear disulfides are rather reactive and can readily react with the P(III) phosphorus usually present in these nucleoside building blocks. Similarly problematic is the use of esters such as 1-5, as these are easily decomposed with nucleophiles such as methylamine routinely used to to remove amide protecting groups present on nucleosides during oligonucleotide synthesis. However, perhaps the most problematic aspect of these thioethyl-based olignucleotide prodrugs is production of a reactive thiirane species. Besides deleterious acute effects, this reactive alkylating agent can, inter alia, readily react with nucleobases present naturally in DNA/RNA.
An effective solution to the above limitations, and the subject of the present invention, is described in Scheme 2. According to this approach, a cyclic disulfide moiety such as present in 2-1 can undergo a reduction analogous to that described in Scheme 1, producing intermediate 2-2. The nucleic acid/oligonucleotide of interest is released in a similar cyclodeesterification as in the case of the linear disulfides, however, the formed substituted thiirane (2-3) undergoes a rapid 1,5-exo-tet ring closure to produce a stable tetrahydrothiophene ring (2-5).
To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, a simple model oligomer was synthesized consisting of only two nucleosides UpU (5-2). The key intermediate, phosphoramidite 3-3 was prepared using either one of synthetic routes described in Scheme 3a. The commercially available 5′-dimethoxytrityl-2′-O-methyl-uridine (3-1) was reacted with bis(diisopropylamino)chlorophosphine to produce intermediate 3-2, which was without isolation reacted with O-propargyl dithiothreitol (3-5) without addition of an auxiliary catalyst. Alternatively, 3-5 can be reacted with bis(diisopropylamino)chlorophosphine to yield intermediate 3-6, which again, without isolation was reacted with nucleoside 3-1 to produce the phosphoramidite 3-3. This compound was purified by silica gel column chromatography typically applied to purification of standard cyanoethyl group containing phosphoramidites and exhibited similar physicochemical behavior, including stability. The O-substituted dithiothreitol 3-5 was prepared from commercially available racemic dithiothreitol and propargyl bromide under phase transfer conditions, Scheme 3a. Similar phase transfer O-alkylations with suitable alkylating agents such as halides or sulfonates were used to access other substituted threitols (DTT) or erythritols (DTE).
In analogous procedures, replacement of uracil in 3-1 with heterocycles such as guanine, adenine or cytosine led to preparation of phosphoramidites derived from guanosine, adenosine or cytidine. Similarly, other 2′-substituted nucleoside phosphoramidites, carrying for example 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro or a suitably protected 2′-OH groups can be prepared (see for example Scheme 3b).
The 5′-unprotected coupling partner in preparation of dimer 5-2 was prepared as described in Scheme 4. 5-Dimethoxytrityl-2′-O-methyl uridine (3-1) was condensed with levulinic acid to yield the ester 4-1, and the acid-labile dimethoxytrityl group was removed using dichloroacetic acid in the presence of dodecanethiol.
The desired UpU 5-2 dimer was then prepared by usual coupling of phosphoramidite 3-3 and alcohol 4-2, as shown in Scheme 5. The oxidation of the P(III) intermediate to the P(V) dimer took place using tert-butyl hydroperoxide.
Since the dithiothreitol employed to make 3-3 consisted of a racemic mixture of trans-isomeres and the P(III) to P(V) oxidation proceeded without stereo control, the dimer 5-2 was obtained as a mixture of four diastereosimeres. To facilitate kinetic studies, these isomeres were separated using preparative HPLC. To gain further mechanistic insights, the single isomeres of 5-2 were extensively analyzed by NMR to provide information regarding preferred conformations within the DTT ring. These studies have confirmed that the relative stereochemistry of the two oxygen atoms (at position 1 and 6 on the DTT ring) is indeed trans, and their absolute orientation is, as expected, di-equatorial.
Exposure of DTE- or DTT-based dimers (5-2) to glutathione (GSH) resulted in rapid cleavage of the disulfide bond and the envisioned cyclodeesterification effected the release of the dimer phosphodiester, FIG. 2 . The kinetic behavior of this model system was found to be consistent with a pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. The half life of prodrug-dimer 5-2 was dependent on the character and excess of the reducing reagent (500:1/Prodrug:GSH), in this instance approximately 4 hours. The kinetics of the release was also dependent on pH and 1M TRIS hydrochloride buffers of pH values varied between 5.0 and 7.8 were used. As expected, the release was considerably slower at acidic conditions (data shown in FIG. 2 were recorded at pH of 7.30). The dithioerythritol (DTE) derivative with cis-stereochemistry (axial/equatorial orientation) showed similar kinetic behavior.
In order to verify that the cleaved dithiothreitol based linker undergoes the envisioned 1,5-exo-tet ring closure to neutralize the transient thiirane, the propargyl group of dimer 5-2 was modified, Scheme 6. It is known that 7-hydroxycoumarin can be easily traced by its strong UV absorbance at 340 nM, and it would make the identification of linker-related products facile. Accordingly, 3-azido-7-hydroxycoumarin was reacted with a single isomer of dimer 5-2 (B1 isomer was used) and the product (6-1) showed strong absorption at both 220 nm (dimethoxytrityl-) as well as 340 nm (coumarin). Exposure to glutathione (or other reducing agent, e.g. TCEP) lead to release of the dimer 6-2 (UV at 220 nm, not at 340 nm) and a product which showed strong UV absorbance at 340 nm, but not at 220 nm. LCMS analysis suggested a molecular weight of 378, which corresponds well for either structure 6-3, or 6-4.
In order to differentiate between thiirane 6-3 and tetrahydrothiophen 6-4, a substantial quantity of this material was needed. The independent synthesis is described in Scheme 7. The commercially available phosphormidite 7-1 was condensed with propargyl dithiothreitol (3-5) under typical reaction conditions (thioethyltetrazole, DCM) and oxidized (tert-butyl hydroperoxide). The UV marker was attached by a click reaction to produce the P(V)-triester 7-3. Exposure of this material to reducing conditions (tributylphosphine) led to rapid ejection of the diester 6-2 and formation of a 340 nm UV active product, which was identical (HPLC/MS, UV) to that obtained from dimer 6-1.
Extensive NMR analysis of this product confirmed, that its structure corresponds to 6-4 and not 6-3, FIG. 3 .
To verify that the release mechanism operates properly when part of an oligomer, the DTT-triester was incorporated into siRNAs targeting β-catenin (CTNNB1 1767). This sequence contained nucleosides with alternating 2′-fluoro and 2′-methyl modification and the triester was incorporated between the first and second nucleoside of the guide strand. The synthesis of the oligomer was performed under standard conditions, as the sterically hindered phosphotriester was quite resistant to methylamine mediated hydrolysis. The P(III) to P(V) oxidation can be performed either by iodine, or tert-butyl hydroperoxide.
Exposure of this RNA oligomer to glutathione (GSH) at concentrations similar to those found in cytoplasm (˜5 mM) lead to release of the RNA oligomer, FIG. 4 . The kinetic behavior was found to be dependent on an excess of the reducing agent (GSH) and pH. The observed half life of the siRNA prodrug (GSH:PD/500:1, pH 7.30) was found to be approximately 9 hours.
The siRNA release is influenced by pH, FIG. 5 , main panel. The reduction is slow at acidic pH values (<10% within 24 hours). To demonstrate that the RNA release is glutathione dependent, the RNA prodrug was exposed to the used buffers at their respective pH values, except that no glutathione was added. Under these conditions no more than 10 percent of RNA release was observed within 24 hours which resulted from passive aqueous hydrolysis of the oligomers ( FIG. 5 , bottom panel).
The propargyl group present in the prodrug is well suited for attachment of targeting, immunossupressing or other groups designed to aid the therapeutic utility of oligomers. For example, N-acetylgalactosamine can bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), a membrane protein present in hepatic cells. Reversible attachment of the N-acetylgalactosamine group to a therapeutic oligomer can be used to target hepatocytes and the release mechanism described in this invention is uniquely suited to exploit this property. A post synthetic incorporation of this targeting group is shown in FIG. 6 . An azide connected to the N,O-peracetylgalactosamine via a short PEG spacer is reacted with the acetylene group present in the linker. The O-acetyl groups are then removed by mild hydrolysis.
This construct provides protection against RNAase mediated RNA cleavage while the oligomer is protected as a prodrug (“extracellular space”, “in transit”), and after the ASPGR mediated hepatocyte uptake the targeting group is jettisoned in a glutathione-mediated event and the active oligomer is released at its site of action. Using this mechanism, attachment of multiple targeting ligands or immunosupressing groups is possible.
To assess the ability of the prodrug construct containing the N-acetyl galactosamine targeting agent ( FIG. 6 ) to eject the active RNA oligomer, the N-acetyl galactosamine prodrug (0.0014 mM concentration) was subjected to glutathione (5 mM, prodrug to GSH ratio of 1:3600) at pH of 7.30. The release of the siRNA was monitored using an LCMS and the data are summarized in FIG. 7 . In this instance, the half life of the ejection was found to be approximately 8 hours.
Oligonucleotides containing more than one incorporation of the cyclic disulfide linking group were synthesized using procedures analogous to those used for preparation of oligonucleotides containing only one prodruging group. In this instance, the regular cyanoethyl group containing phosphoramidite was replaced with the phosphoramidite containing the cyclic disulfide at the desired position of the sequence. The efficacy of this synthetic protocol was demonstrated by incorporation of as many as five cyclic disulfide prodruging groups per strand, FIG. 8 .
Exposure of these sequences (15 μM) to 5 mM concentration of glutathione at pH 7.3 (aqueous TRIS.HCl buffer) led to gradual ejection of the parent RNAs. Time course of this release was monitored using an LC/MS and the respective release-curves (x-axis: time in seconds, and the y-axis: area peak) are shown in FIG. 9 .
Biology
To investigate the biological significance of the present invention, we have incorporated the triester-prodrug into siRNA molecules designed to target the CTNNB1 gene, which encodes the β-catenin protein and corresponds to a twenty one nucleotide sequence beginning at nucleotide 1797 (for structures see FIG. 10 ). The triester-prodrug (DTT) moiety was incorporated between the first and second uridine nucleotides at the 5′-terminus of the guide strand of the siRNA duplex. The nucleosides included within the RNA oligomer were 2′-modified (F, or OMe) to impart stability. The first and last nucleosides of the passenger strand were protected by 5′-phosphodiester containing anhydroribitols (iB). In addition, the iB at the 5′-end of the passenger strand carried a hexylamino group for conjugation to targeting groups, FIG. 10 .
Negative charges present along the phosphodiester backbone of oligonucleotides represent an important recognition element of nucleolytic enzymes. Incorporation of phosphotriester-based prodrugs is therefore expected to confer metabolic stability to oligomers. This represents an important use of the instant invention as temporary (extracytoplasmic) protection of oligomers is an important condition for their successful therapeutic use. Data demonstrating this behavior are summarized in Table 1. At 60 and 120 minutes, the prodrug-triester containing duplexes (CTNNB1(1797)13bDTT, for structures see FIG. 10 ) showed comparable stability in mouse S9 homogenates (pH 7.5) as well as mouse serum to those with a phosphodiester bond between nucleosides 1 and 2 of the guide strand. However, under conditions mimicking that of rat lysosomes (pH 5.5), the prodrug triester containing siRNAs (R-008522970-000C) proved to be completely stable, while the 1,2-phosphodiesters (R-008428355-000S) were completely hydrolyzed.

The in vivo efficacy of these siRNA prodrugs, structures of which are indicated in FIG. 10 , was demonstrated at doses of 1 and 5 mpk in mouse, FIG. 11 . The duplexes counting the the DTT-triester prodrug between the first and second nucleoside of the guide strand were shown to be as efficacious as those containing phosphothioate between nucleosides 1,2 and 3,4. Under these conditions, duplexes containing no triester prodrug or thioate modification at these positions were inactive.
The in vitro cell-based potency of duplexes containing multiple prodrug incorporations was evaluated using Hepa 1-6 cells (IC50, at 24 h). The respective in vivo activity was assessed by subcutaneous injection of 1 and 5 mpk in mice and the degradation of target RNA (percent KD, “knockdown”) was measured after 72 h. Data are summarized in FIGS. 12 (one through five incorporations) and 13 (six through ten incorporations).
Solid-Phase Synthesis of Oligonucleotides
Synthesis of oligonucleotides from natural or chemically modified nucleoside phosphoramidites (phosphoramidites) proceeds in a synthesis cycle where a series of 4 chemical steps is repeated, varying the nature of the phosphoramidite, to obtain the requisite oligonucleotide sequence. The synthesis is carried out on an automated synthesizer from the 3′- to 5′-end on a solid support, typically controlled pore glass (CPG) or polymer bead, where the first 3′ protected nucleoside is attached to the support via a suitable linker, often comprising a succinyl linkage.
The first step in the synthesis cycle is removal of a 5′-hydroxyl dimethoxytrityl (DMT) protecting group by treatment with a suitable acid, such as trichloroacetic acid or dichloroacetic acid. Following deprotection, the second step is chain elongation by coupling with a suitably protected phosphoramidite in the presence of an activator, such as 5-ethylthio-1H-tetrazole. The third step in the synthesis cycle is oxidation of phosphorous using an oxidizer, such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide, or iodine in pyridine. Finally, the fourth step is capping any remaining uncoupled 5′-hydroxyl groups with a suitable agent, such as acetic anhydride. This synthesis cycle is repeated; varying the nature of the phosphoramidite, until the desired chain length and composition has been prepared.
The protected oligonucleotide is then liberated from the solid phase support by treatment with a suitable base, such as methylamine in water, which can affect both the cleavage of the oligonucleotide chain from the solid support, as well as remove any exocyclic amine protecting groups. If the oligonucleotide contains any 2′-O-silyl protecting groups, these may be removed by treatment with a suitable reagent, such as triethylamine trihydroflouride.
The crude 5′-DMT protected oligonucleotide is then purified on a suitable support, such as a C-18 resin, where deprotection by-products are removed by elution with aqueous solvents, short-chain capped oligonucleotides may be removed with buffer elution, and the final 5′-DMT protecting group is removed by treatment with an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid. The purified oligonucleotide is then eluted using a suitable mixture of an organic solvent in water.
This process is repeated to prepare a suitably complimentary oligonucleotide strand.
The two complimentary strands are then mixed together in a 1:1 molar ratio to afford an siRNA duplex.
Intermediates and Compounds
All non-hydrolytic reactions, unless indicated otherwise were carried out in dry solvents purchased from Aldrich. HPLC analyses, except for the amidites, were performed at 60° C. using an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18, 2.1×50 mm, 1.8 micron column, at 0.8 mL/min flow rate, eluted with a gradient (5 to 95%) of acetonitrile and water with formic acid (0.1%) as a modifier. The amidites were analyzed using a Supelco Ascentis C18, 100×4.6 mm, 2.7 micron column and ammonium formate (3 mM) as a modifier, under otherwise identical conditions. UV traces were recorded at 220 nm and mass spectra were obtained using an Agilent Technologies 6140 Quadrupole LC/MS mass spectrometer in both positive and negative ion mode. Preparative purifications were performed by gradient chromatography on a Teledyne Isco CombiFlash Rf using pre-packed columns. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 600, 500, or 400 spectrometers.
