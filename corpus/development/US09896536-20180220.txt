FIELD
Described herein are compositions including heterocyclic organic compounds. More specifically, described herein are fused pyrrole-containing compounds in combination with diketopyrrolopyrrole compounds, methods for making them, and uses thereof.
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
Highly conjugated organic materials, due to their interesting electronic and optoelectronic properties, are being investigated for use in a variety of applications, including organic semiconductors (OSCs), field effect transistors (FETs), thin-film transistors (TFTs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), electro-optic (EO) applications, as conductive materials, as two photon mixing materials, as organic semiconductors, and as non-linear optical (NLO) materials.
In particular, OSCs have attracted a great amount of attention in the research community due to their advantages over inorganic semiconductors, including easy processing, high mechanical flexibility, low cost production, and low weights. Polycyclic aromatic compounds, such as oligothiophenes, acenes, rylenes, phthalocyanens, and polythiophene, have been widely studied as semiconductor materials.
Among the organic p-type semiconductors, pentacene exhibits charge mobilities well above 1 cm2/V·s in organic field effect transistor devices. This number has been set up as a bench mark for new small molecule systems in terms of mobility requirements. However, due to the continuing need for improved performance and stability in semiconductor structures, there continues to be an unmet need to develop better performing OSCs that have improved mobility, are structurally stable, and applicable to the large number of potential applications seen in the various high technology markets.
SUMMARY
Embodiments comprise a rationally designed family of compounds and polymers comprising optionally-substituted dihydropyrroloindoles (“DHPI”), dipyrrolothiophenes or fused pyrroles (all generally referred to as “pyrrole groups” herein) bridged to optionally substituted diketopyrrolopyrroles (“DPP”). The materials have advantages over DPP alone in that they are soluble in non-chlorinated solvents, efficiently synthesized, and show very high mobilities in non-chlorinated solvents. Further, the compounds are relatively easy to modify and substituents can be introduced to multiple positions which allows for fine tuning material packing behaviors.

Embodiments comprise rationally designed compounds and polymers comprising optionally-substituted dihydropyrroloindoles (“DHPI”), dipyrrolothiophenes or fused pyrroles (all generally referred to as “pyrrole groups” herein) bridged to optionally substituted diketopyrrolopyrroles (“DPP”). The materials have advantages over DPP alone in that they are soluble in non-chlorinated solvents, efficiently synthesized, and show very high mobilities in non-chlorinated solvents. Further, the compounds are relatively easy to modify and substituents can be introduced to multiple positions which allows for fine tuning material packing behaviors.

In some embodiments, X is NR1, PR1, AsR1, Sb, O, S, Se, or Te with the proviso that due to conjugation, X may be bonded to one or more additional R1; and each R, R1, R2, and R3 is independently H, halo, optionally substituted C1-C40 alkyl, optionally substituted aralkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, optionally substituted C2-C40 alkenyl, optionally substituted C2-C40 alkynyl, aminocarbonyl, acylamino, acyloxy, optionally substituted aryl, aryloxy, optionally substituted amino, carboxyalkyl, optionally substituted cycloalkyl, optionally substituted cycloalkenyl, halo, acyl, optionally substituted heteroaryl, optionally substituted heteroaralkyl, heteroaryloxy, optionally substituted heterocyclyl, thiol, alkylthio, heteroarylthiol, optionally substituted sulfoxide, or optionally substituted sulfone.

In some embodiments, each R2 is independently H, optionally substituted alkyl, or halo. In particular, due to improvements in solubility and other factor, it is advantageous in some embodiments to have at least one or more of R, R2, or R3 independently be an optionally substituted C1-C20 alkyl or C2-C20 alkenyl, and in particular an optionally substituted branched C1-C20 alkyl or C2-C20 alkenyl. Particular embodiments may have optionally substituted C1-C20 alkyl groups only on one or more R2 groups, or alternatively only on one or more R groups.
In some embodiments, particularly where compounds 1a-1e and 2 are to be used in polymerization steps, each Y is independently H, halo, —OSO-alkyl, —Mg-halo, —Zn-halo, —Sn(alkyl)3, —SnH3, —B(OH)2, or —B(alkoxy)2.
Another aspect comprises methods of making compounds 1a-1e and 2. The formation of the dipyrrolopyrole (DPP) moiety can be done via the reaction scheme shown in Tieke et al., Beilstein, J. Org. Chem. 830 (2010), 25 Chem. Mater. 782 (2013), and U.S. application Ser. No. 13/665,055, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Generally, the reaction to form the DPP moiety is shown via the following reaction scheme (Scheme 1):
Formation of the pyrrole groups can be done via a number of chemical processes. For example, it can be done via cyclization of a diamine- or amide-modified benzene ring. A number of cyclization processes have been developed to prepare the DHPIs described herein. For example, in Scheme 2, a N,N′-1,4-Phenylenebis[2-chloro-N—R2]acetamide is added to anhydrous aluminum chloride in an oil bath at ˜200° C., cooled and filtered to produce the DHPI-dione shown.
The DHPI-dione can be converted to a di-halo moiety via reaction (Scheme 3):
Similarly, PCl5 can be used to make the chlorine-based equivalent of the structure in Scheme 3.
The modification nitrogen on the diindole group can be accomplished via the use of a base, such as potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in solvent (e.g., DMSO) followed by reaction with R2Br (Scheme 4): where R, R1, Ar, X, and k are as noted above. These reactions can also be applied to the other compounds disclosed herein.
Dibromination of the pyrrole groups can be accomplished using techniques developed by the inventors, see, e.g., PCT Int. Appl., 2011146308, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, where a compounds such as N-bromosuccinimide is used to brominate the pyrrole groups through radical reaction (Scheme 5): Likewise, precursors to compounds 1b-1e, and 2, may also be brominated in a similar fashion.
In some cases, it is advantageous to place a reactive tin group on the pyrrole groups. It is possible to obtain a ditin-modified pyrrole group via methods developed by the inventors, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 8,278,346, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The ditin compound may be obtained either directly from reaction of a di-hydrogen compound or from the dibromo compound as shown in Scheme 6: Likewise, the pyrrole groups in 1b-1e, and 2, may also be converted in a similar fashion.
In some embodiments, it may be advantageous to create a monomer of 1a-1e or 2. In such cases, it may be necessary to modify the chemistry of Scheme 6 to limit the formation of the ditin group to one side of the pyrrole compound. Modifications including the use of protecting groups or rendering reactive sites inactive is known in the art. Once the tin compound is formed, the pyrrole compound may be reacted with a bromo-modified DPP to produce compounds 1a-1e and 2. For example, a tin-modified compound of structure: is reacted with a di-halo DPP of structure: where X is halo and Ar, k, R, R1, R2, and R3 are as defined above to produce structure 1a. This reaction is equally applicable to the other pyrrole structures in 1b-1e and 2.
In another aspect, the composition comprises a polymer comprising at least one moiety of formula 1a′, 1b′, 1c′, 1d′, 1e′, or 2′: wherein n is an integer greater than zero; X, Y, R, R1, and R2 all have the same meanings as above. In some embodiments, n is an integer from about 1 to 500. In some embodiments, n is an integer from about 3 to about 20, about 3 to about 15, about 3 to about 12, about 3 to about 10, or about 5 to about 9. In some embodiments, n is an integer about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500.
Another aspect comprises a method of making a polymer comprising at least one moiety of formula 1a′, 1b′, 1c′, 1d′, 1e′, or 2′: by respectively polymerizing a compound of structure: with a compound of structure: where X is halo and Z is H or an optionally substituted alkyl and n, X, Y, R, R1, and R2 all have the same meanings as above.
The polymerization may be done via a method similar to that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 8,278,346, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. For example, a ditin compound of structure: where is reacted with a di-halo DPP of structure: where X is halo and Ar, k, R, R1, R2, and R3 are as defined above. This reaction is equally applicable to the other pyrrole structures of 1b-1e and 2.
Alternatively, in some embodiments, it may be possible to form the polymers directly from compounds 1a-1e and 2. For example, such embodiments may be made by forming two solutions of compounds 1a-1e and 2 with different reactive groups, for example where for one solution Y is a ditin moiety, and for a second solution Y is a dibromo moiety. Upon combination and reaction of the two solutions, polymerization leading to a polymer of 1a′-1e′ or 2′ would result.
In another aspect, embodiments herein are optimized for reorganization energy and mobility. In some embodiments, compounds embodied herein have improved solid state properties as a result of lower reorganization energy and/or higher mobility. In some embodiments, the properties of the compounds embodied herein may be described by Marcus theory (R. A. Marcus, 65 REV. MOD. PHYS. 599 (1993), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).
Charge transport properties depend critically on the degree of ordering of the system or molecular ordering in the solid state, as well as the density of chemical impurities and/or structural defects such as grain size and dislocations. At the electronic level, two of the most important factors that control transport properties in organic conjugated materials are the interchain transfer integral β, and the reorganization energy λ. The transfer integral expresses the ease of transfer of a charge between interacting chains. The reorganization energy term describes the strength of the electron-phonon coupling. It is proportional to the geometric relaxation energy of the charged molecule over the individual neutral unit. In the context of semi-classical electron-transfer theory, the electron-transfer (hopping) rate can be expressed from Marcus theory in a simplified way as:
(R. A. Marcus, 65 REV. MOD. PHYS. 599 (1993), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) where T is the temperature, λ is the reorganization energy, β is the transfer integral, and h and kB are the Planck and Boltzmann constants, respectively.
It is possible to simplify equation (1) to:
in order to characterize the relative influence of both parameters λ and β to the charge transport rate. As can be seen from equation (2), the difference in mobility for different transfer integrals, β, is only significant for small values of the reorganization energy, λ. A big increase in the transfer integral does not yield a significant variation in the mobility, unless the reorganization energies are small. This implies that any optimization of the mobility should start with the design of single molecules with very low reorganization energy.
The reorganization energy includes two contributions that are associated with charge hopping. One is introduced by the geometric changes within the single molecule, and is denoted the internal part. The second one arises from the repolarization changes of the surrounding medium and is usually much smaller than the first one. In studies to qualitatively order molecules, it is generally valid to neglect this last contribution in the evaluation of the reorganization energy as no significant solvent reorganization occurs during the charge transfer in the condensed phase.
Table 1 incorporates reorganization energies for a number of embodiments. For each molecule, the geometry is optimized using quantum mechanics for both neutral and ionic states. Consequently, the basic hopping step in a molecular wire is defined by four energies: E0 and E+ represent the energies of the neutral and cation species in their lowest energy geometries, respectively, while E0* and E+* represent the energies of the neutral and cation species with the geometries of the cation and neutral species, respectively. The table provides neutral total dipole for the molecule, the vertical ionization potential, the hole reorganization energy, and the Pareto Front.
The quantum mechanics calculations to determine these above mentioned quantities used the experimentally parameterized Hamiltonian PM6 implemented in VAMP® semi-empirical molecular orbital software (Accelrys Software Inc.). Pentacene was used as the reference to validate the Hole Reorganization Energy calculations. Experimental data for Pentacene RE was ˜0.12 eV (see M. Malagoli and J. L. Bredas, 327 CHEM. PHYS. LETT. 13 (2000) and N. W. Gruhn et al., 89 PHYS. REV. LETT. 275503 (2002), both hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety), compared to 0.114 eV from our calculations based on VAMP® (Accelrys Software Inc.).
Hole Reorganization energies for embodiments may comprise from about 0 eV to about 0.75 eV. In some embodiments, the hole reorganization energy is from about 0.04 to about 0.75 eV. In some embodiments, the hole reorganization energy is 0.75 eV or less. In some embodiments, the hole reorganization energy is about 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15, 0.17, 0.19, 0.20, 0.22, 0.25, 0.27, 0.30, 0.31, 0.32, 0.33, 0.34, 0.35, 0.37, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, or 0.75.
