FIELD
The present invention relates to compounds and methods for treating disorders and specifically to agonists and antagonists for EP4 receptors.
BACKGROUND
The prostanoid EP4 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates the actions of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and is characterized by the longest intracellular C terminus loop when compared to other prostanoid receptors. The EP4 receptor is one of four receptor subtypes of prostaglandin E2 receptors. In general, EP4 receptors couple to G proteins and mediate elevations in cyclic-adenosine monophsophate (“cAMP”) concentration, although they do participate in other pathways as well. Expression of EP4 receptors is controlled by various physiological and pathophysiological processes as these receptors participate in ovulation and fertilization, induce bone formation, T cell factor signaling, protect against inflammatory bowel disease, facilitate Langerhans cell migration and maturation and mediate joint inflammation in a model of collagen-induced arthritis, among others.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,552,067, expressly incorporated herein by reference, teaches the use of prostaglandin EP4 selective agonists for the treatment of methods of treating conditions which present with low bone mass, particularly osteoporosis, frailty, an osteoporotic fracture, a bone defect, childhood idiopathic bone loss, alveolar bone loss, mandibular bone loss, bone fracture, osteotomy, bone loss associated with periodontitis, or prosthetic ingrowth in a mammal.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,586,468, expressly incorporated herein by reference, teaches that prostaglandin EP4 agonists may be useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of autoimmune disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Sjoegren's syndrome, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, post-transplantation graft rejection, asthma, abnormal bone formation, neurocyte death, pulmopathy, hepatopathy, acute hepatitis, nephritis, renal insufficiency, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, systemic inflammatory syndrome, pain induced by ambustion, sepsis, hemophagocytosis syndrome, macrophage activation syndrome, Still's diseases, Kawasaki diseases, burns, systemic granuloma, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's diseases, hypercytokinemia at dialysis and multiple organ failure and shock.
Inflammatory bowel disease constitutes a group of diseases characterized by inflammation of the large and small intestines and manifests symptoms such as diarrhea, pain, and weight loss. Kabashima and colleagues taught that “EP4 works to keep mucosal integrity, to suppress the innate immunity, and to down regulate the proliferation and activation of CD4+ T cells. These findings have not only elucidated the mechanisms of IBD by NSAIDs, but also indicated the therapeutic potential of EP4-selective agonists in prevention and treatment of IBD.” (Kabashima, et. al., The Journal of Clinical Investigation, April 2002, Vol. 9, 883-893).
Various other diseases are mediated by the EP4 receptor such as esophageal ulcers, alcohol gastropathy, duodenal ulcers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastroenteropathy and intestinal ischemia. New methods for treating or preventing such diseases are desired.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention claimed. As used herein, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. As used herein, “or” means “and/or” unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, use of the term “including” as well as other forms, such as “includes,” and “included,” is not limiting.
As used herein “alkane” refers to compounds consisting of only hydrogen and carbon, fully saturated and containing only single bonds.
As used herein, “alkyl” refers to straight or branched chain hydrocarbyl groups having from 1 to about 100 carbon atoms. Whenever it appears herein, a numerical range, such as “1 to 100” or “C1-C100”, refers to each integer in the given range; e.g., “C1-C100 alkyl” means that an alkyl group may comprise only 1 carbon atom, 2 carbon atoms, 3 carbon atoms, etc., up to and including 100 carbon atoms, although the term “alkyl” also includes instances where no numerical range of carbon atoms is designated. For example, the term “alkyl” can refer to a sub-range between C1-C100 (e.g. C1-C6). “Substituted alkyl” refers to alkyl moieties bearing substituents including alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, hydroxy, oxo, alkoxy, mercapto, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, heterocyclic, substituted heterocyclic, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, aryloxy, substituted aryloxy, halogen, haloalkyl, cyano, nitro, nitrone, amino, lower alkylamino, lower alkyldiamino, amido, azido, —C(O)H, —C(O)R9, —CH2OR9, —C(O)—, —S—, —S(O)2, —OC(O)—O—, wherein R9 is H or lower alkyl, acyl, oxyacyl, carboxyl, carbamate, sulfonyl, sulfonamide, sulfuryl, and the like. As used herein, “lower alkyl” refers to alkyl moieties having from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms.
As used herein, “alkenyl” refers to straight or branched chain hydrocarbyl groups having at least one carbon-carbon double bond, and having in the range of about 2 up to about 100 carbon atoms, and “substituted alkenyl” refers to alkenyl groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above. As used herein, “lower alkenyl” refers to alkenyl moieties having from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms.
As used herein, “alkynyl” refers to straight or branched chain hydrocarbyl groups having at least one carbon-carbon triple bond, and having in the range of about 2 up to about 100 carbon atoms, and “substituted alkynyl” refers to alkynyl groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above. As used herein, “lower alkynyl” refers to alkynyl moieties having from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms.
As used herein, “cycloalkyl” refers to cyclic (i.e., ring-containing) alkyl moieties typically containing in the range of about 3 up to about 8 carbon atoms, and “substituted cycloalkyl” refers to cycloalkyl groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above.
As used herein, “aryl” refers to aromatic groups having in the range of 5 up to 14 (e.g., phenyl) carbon atoms and “substituted aryl” refers to aryl groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above.
As used herein “arylene” and “heteroarylene” refer to an aryl ring or ring system or a heteroaryl ring or ring system which connects two other parts of a molecule, i.e. the two parts are bonded to the ring or ring system in two distinct ring positions. Arylene and heteroarylene may be substituted or unsubstituted. Unsubstituted arylene and heteroarylene have no substituents other than the two parts of the molecule it connects. Substituted arylene and heteroarylene have substituents in addition to the two parts of the molecule it connects.
An “effective amount” of a compound is an amount sufficient to contribute to the treatment, prevention (e.g. prophylaxis), or reduction of a symptom or symptoms of a disease. Where recited in reference to a disease treatment, an “effective amount” may also be referred to as a “therapeutically effective amount.” A “reduction” of a symptom or symptoms (and grammatical equivalents of this phrase) means decreasing of the severity or frequency of the symptom(s), or elimination of the symptom(s). A “prophylactically effective amount” of a drug is an amount of a drug that, when administered to a subject, will have the intended prophylactic effect, e.g., preventing or delaying the onset (or reoccurrence) a disease, disorder or condition, or reducing the likelihood of the onset (or reoccurrence) of a disease, disorder or condition or symptoms thereof. The full prophylactic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a prophylactically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations.
As used herein, “heteroaryl” refers to aromatic moieties containing one or more heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S, or the like) as part of the ring structure and having in the range of 5 up to 14 total atoms in the ring structure (i.e., carbon atoms and heteroatoms). “Substituted heteroaryl” refers to heteroaryl groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above.
As used herein, “heterocyclic” refers to non-aromatic cyclic (i.e., ring-containing) groups containing one or more heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S, or the like) as part of the ring structure, and having in the range of 3 up to 14 carbon atoms and “substituted heterocyclic” refers to heterocyclic groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above.
As used herein, “halogen” or “halide” refers to fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide. “Fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide” may also be referred to as “fluoro”, “chloro”, “bromo”, or “iodo”.
It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that some of the compounds of the invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers, such that the compounds may exist in enantiomeric as well as in diastereomeric forms. Unless it is specifically noted otherwise, the scope of the present invention includes all enantiomers, diastereomers and racemic mixtures. Some of the compounds of the invention may form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases, and such pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein are also within the scope of the invention.
As used herein, “diastereomers” are stereoisomers in which asymmetric centers are different but which are not enantiomers.
In particular, a skilled person will realize that even if the absolute stereochemistry of a particular stereoisomer (e.g. an enantiomer or diastereomer) of a molecule is not known, that particular stereoisomer can be distinguished from the other stereoisomers by use of other techniques (e.g. polarimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, chromatography, and others identifiable to a skilled person).
In particular, one exemplary method of distinguishing stereoisomers when the absolute stereochemistry of each stereoisomer is not known is chromatography such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin-layer chromatograph (TLC). In particular, two or more stereoisomers such as diastereomers can be separated and characterized by their retention times and of Rf values, which would be expected to be replicable by using the same chromatographic conditions (e.g. flow rate, column material, TLC stationary phase, solvent systems/gradient profiles, and others identifiable to a skilled person). In particular, a skilled person will realize that even when the exact relative retention times and/or Rf values of one or more stereoisomers is not replicated (e.g. due to slight variations in the chromatographic parameters and/or chromatographic equipment), a stereoisomer with a shorter retention time can be said to be “faster eluting” and a stereoisomer with a linger retention time can be said to be “slower eluting”, and similarly, a stereoisomer with smaller Rf value can be said to have a “low Rf” and a stereoisomer with a larger Rf value can be said to have a “high Rf”.
A skilled person will realize that once two or more stereoisomers are distinguished by a technique such as chromatography (e.g. HPLC and/or TLC), the absolute stereochemistry of the stereoisomers can be determined by techniques or combinations of techniques identifiable to a skilled person (e.g. x-ray crystallography, vibrational circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance, total synthesis, and others identifiable to a skilled person).
A “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is any salt that retains the activity of the parent compound and does not impart any additional deleterious or untoward effects on the subject to which it is administered and in the context in which it is administered compared to the parent compound. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt also refers to any salt which may form in vivo as a result of administration of an acid, another salt, or a prodrug which is converted into an acid or salt.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic functional groups may be derived from organic or inorganic bases. The salt may comprise a mono or polyvalent ion. Of particular interest are the inorganic ions, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Organic salts may be made with amines, particularly ammonium salts such as mono-, di- and trialkyl amines or ethanol amines. Salts may also be formed with caffeine, tromethamine and similar molecules. Hydrochloric acid or some other pharmaceutically acceptable acid may form a salt with a compound that includes a basic group, such as an amine or a pyridine ring. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is also meant to include salts of active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituent moieties found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 1977, 66:1-19) which is incorporated by reference. Certain specific compounds of the present invention may contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.
A “prodrug” is a compound which is converted to a therapeutically active compound after administration, and the term should be interpreted as broadly herein as is generally understood in the art. While not intending to limit the scope of the invention, conversion may occur by hydrolysis of an ester group or some other biologically labile group or to mean compounds which are converted or metabolized into an active compound, e.g., by covalently bonded carriers, which are capable of releasing an active ingredient when the prodrug is administered to a subject (e.g. mammalian subject). Generally, but not necessarily, a prodrug is inactive or less active than the therapeutically active compound to which it is converted.
The terms “treating” or “treatment” refers to any indicia of success in the treatment or amelioration of an injury, pathology or condition, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement; remission; diminishing of symptoms or making the injury, pathology or condition more tolerable to the patient; slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline; making the final point of degeneration less debilitating; improving a patient's physical or mental well-being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters; including the results of a physical examination.
The present invention also provides compounds and methods for wound healing and scar reduction. The compounds and methods of the present invention include at least one EP4 agonist or antagonist. Wounds and or scars that can be treated by the compounds and methods of the invention can arise from events such as surgery, trauma, disease, mechanical injury, burn, radiation, poisoning, and the like. As used herein, the term “skin blemish” includes a flesh wound, scar, or wrinkle on any region of the skin of a body.
A “flesh wound” can be any area in which the structural integrity of the exterior surface of the skin is compromised. A flesh wound can be due to incision, laceration, abrasion, thermal burn, chemical burn, radiation or puncture of the skin. The wound can be superficial or extend to the deeper layers of the dermis, subcutaneous, deep fascia, muscle, bone or other internal organs.
A “scar” is an area of fibrous tissue (fibrosis) that replaces normal skin (or other tissue) after injury or disease. Scar types include hypertrophic scars, recessed scars, and stretch marks. Hypertrophic scars occur when the body overproduces collagen, which causes the scar to be raised above the surrounding skin. An example of a hypertrophic scar is a keloid scar. Atrophic, or recessed scars, have a sunken appearance and result when underlying support structure in the skin is lost. Stretch marks (striae) occur when skin is stretched rapidly (i.e., due to significant weight gain or growth spurt), or when skin is put under tension during the healing process, typically near a joint. As used herein, the term “scar” encompasses any type of scar in the skin due to any cause, as would be understood to a skilled person upon a reading of the present disclosure.
As used herein, the term “wrinkle” is a fold, ridge, crease, furrow, pit, crater, or sunken area in the skin that can be caused by habitual facial expressions, loss of collagen and/or elasticity due to aging, sun damage, smoking, poor hydration, and various other factors. A wrinkle can range from a deep crease to a fine line. Wrinkles occurring on any part of a body, in particular, wrinkles on head or neck of a subject are contemplated herein. Wrinkles that can be treated in accordance with the disclosure include, but are not limited to, a brow furrow, crows feet, nasolabial fold, one or more lines under the eyes or between the eye brows, and combinations thereof.
When the compounds are administered to treat a wound, the compounds promote normal healing compared to a wound without the administration. That is, the size (length, depth, height and/or width), character, color and/or texture of the treated wound more closely resemble normal, non-wounded tissue. In this regard, treatment of a wound with the disclosed compounds can prevent, minimize or improve the appearance of a scar formation resulting from healing of the wound. Further, when the disclosed compounds are administered to treat a wrinkle, the wrinkle is treated if the appearance or prominence of the wrinkle is visibly or clinically diminished. That is the length and/or depth is decreased compared to the wrinkle prior to treatment. Alternatively, treatment can comprise prevention of a wrinkle. In this regard, the disclosed compounds can be applied to a region of the skin that typically develops a wrinkle, such as a forehead, lips, eyelids, nasolabial fold, skin under an eye, or between the eye brows in order to prevent the development of a wrinkle.
The compounds of the prevent invention can be administered to prevent scar formation not associated with a wound, such as a stretch mark, or scars resulting from acne, chicken pox, measles or other disease states. In certain embodiments, the disclosed compounds are administered to the area of skin expansion in order to prevent formation of such scars. In these embodiments, the compounds can be administered to any region of a face, abdomen, breasts, arms, legs, buttocks, back, or any other area where the skin is susceptible to developing a scar.
The compounds can be administered prior to, concurrently with, and/or after the development of the skin blemish. For instance, the disclosed compounds can be administered prior to an incision, during a surgical procedure, and/or any time post-operatively, and then additionally administered after the procedure as the healing process occurs. In another example, the compounds can be administered during pregnancy to prevent stretch marks. Alternately, the compounds can be administered after the development of a blemish.

Biological Data
Binding Data
Data from running binding and activity studies on the compounds of the invention were carried out as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,427,685, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Ki Binding Data
Competition binding experiments were performed in a medium containing Hank's balanced salt solution, Hepes 20 mM, pH 7.3, membranes (˜60 μg protein) or 2×105 cells from HEK 293 cells stably expressing human EP2 receptors, [3H]PGE2 (10 nM) and various concentrations of test compounds in a total volume of 300 μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 23° C. for 60 min, and were filtered over Whatman GF IB filters under vacuum. Filters were washed three times with 5 ml ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris/HCl (PH 7.3). Non-specific binding was estimated in the presence of excess unlabeled PGE2 (10 μM). Binding data fitted to the binding model for a single class of binding sites, using nonlinear regression analysis. IC50 values thus obtained were converted to Ki using the equation of Ki=(IC50/(1+[L]/KD) where [L] represents PGE2 concentration (10 nM) and KD the dissociation constant for [3H]PGE2 at human EP2 receptors (40 nM).
Radioligand Binding
Cells Stably Expressing EP1, EP2, EP4, and FP Receptors
HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human or feline FP receptor, or EP1, EP2, or EP4 receptors were washed with TME buffer, scraped from the bottom of the flasks, and homogenized for 30 sec using a Brinkman PT 10/35 polytron. TME buffer was added to achieve a final 40 ml volume in the centrifuge tubes (the composition of TME is 100 mM TRIS base, 20 mM MgCl2, 2M EDTA; ION HCl is added to achieve a pH of 7.4).
The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 19000 rpm for 20 min at 4° C. using a Beckman Ti-60 rotor. The resultant pellet was resuspended in TME buffer to give a final 1 mg/ml protein concentration, as determined by Biorad assay. Radioligand binding competition assays vs. [3H-]17-phenyl PGF2α (5 nM) were performed in a 100 g 1 volume for 60 min. Binding reactions were started by adding plasma membrane fraction. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 ml ice-cold TRIS-HCl buffer and rapid filtration through glass fiber GF/B filters using a Brandel cell harvester. The filters were washed 3 times with ice-cold buffer and oven dried for one hour.
[3H-] PGE2 (specific activity 180 Ci mmol) was used as the radio ligand for EP receptors. [3H] 17-phenyl PGF2α was employed for FP receptor binding studies. Binding studies employing EP1, EP2, EP4 and FP receptors were performed in duplicate in at least three separate experiments. A 200 μl assay volume was used. Incubations were for 60 min at 25° C. and were terminated by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold 50 mM TRIS-HCl, followed by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters and three additional 4 ml washes in a cell harvester (Brandel). Competition studies were performed using a final concentration of 5 nM [3H]-PGE2, or 5 nM [3H] 17-phenyl PGF2α and non-specific binding determined with 10−5 M of unlabeled PGE2, or 17-phenyl PGF2α, according to receptor subtype studied.
Methods for FLIPR™ Studies
(a) Cell Culture
HEK-293(EBNA) cells, stably expressing one type or subtype of recombinant human prostaglandin receptors (prostaglandin receptors expressed: hDP/Gqs5; hEP1; hEP2/Gqs5; hEP3A/Gqi5; hEP4/Gqs5; hFP; hIP; hTP), were cultured in 100 mm culture dishes in high-glucose DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM I-glutamine, 250 μg/ml geneticin (G418) and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B as selection markers, and 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B.
(b) Calcium Signal Studies on the FLIPR™
Cells were seeded at a density of 5×104 cells per well in Biocoat® Poly-D-lysine-coated black-wall, clear-bottom 96-well plates (Becton-Dickinson) and allowed to attach overnight in an incubator at 37° C. Cells were then washed two times with HBSS-HEPES buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution without bicarbonate and phenol red, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) using a Denley Cellwash plate washer (Labsystems). After 45 minutes of dye-loading in the dark, using the calcium-sensitive dye Fluo-4 AM at a final concentration of 2 μM, plates were washed four times with HBSS-HEPES buffer to remove excess dye leaving 100 μL in each well. Plates were re-equilibrated to 37° C. for a few minutes.
Cells were excited with an Argon laser at 488 nm, and emission was measured through a 510-570 nm bandwidth emission filter (FLIPR™, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). Drug solution was added in a 50 μL volume to each well to give the desired final concentration. The peak increase in fluorescence intensity was recorded for each well. On each plate, four wells each served as negative (HBSS-HEPES buffer) and positive controls (standard agonists: BW245C (hDP); PGE2(hEP1; hEP2/Gqs5; hEP3A/Gqi5; hEP4/Gqs5); PGF2α (hFP); carbacyclin (hIP); U-46619 (hTP), depending on receptor). The peak fluorescence change in each drug-containing well was then expressed relative to the controls.
Compounds were tested in a high-throughput (HTS) or concentration-response (CoRe) format. In the HTS format, forty-four compounds per plate were examined in duplicates at a concentration of 10−5 M. To generate concentration-response curves, four compounds per plate were tested in duplicates in a concentration range between 10−5 and 10−11. The duplicate values were averaged. In either, HTS or CoRe format each compound was tested on at least 3 separate plates using cells from different passages to give an n≥3.
cAMP Assay
A 384-well drug plate was prepared to contain 6 test compounds, PGE2 and cAMP in 16 serial dilutions in triplicate, using a Biomek station. HEK-EBNA cells expressing a target PG receptor subtype (EP2 or EP4) were suspended in a stimulation buffer (HBSS, 0.1% BSA, 0.5 mM IBMX and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) in a density of 104 cells/5 μL. The reaction was initiated by mixing 5 μL drug dilutions with 5 μL of HEK-EBNA cells in a well, carried out for 30 min at room temperature, and followed by the addition of 5 μL anti-cAMP acceptor beads in the control buffer with Tween-20 (25 mM NaCl, 0.03% Tween-20, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). After 30 min in the dark at room temperature, the mixtures were incubated with 15 μL biotinylated-cAMP/strepavidin donor beads in Lysis/Detection buffer (0.1% BSA, 0.3% Tween-20 and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) for 45 min at the room temperature. Fluorescence changes were read using a Fusion-alpha HT microplate reader.
The results set forth below in Table 1 demonstrate that the compounds disclosed herein are selective prostaglandin EP4 agonists and antagonists, and are thus useful for the treatment of pathological conditions associated with EP4 receptors. In Table 1, “NA” indicates no activity.  TABLE 1

A liquid which is ophthalmically acceptable is formulated such that it can be administered topically to the eye. The comfort should be maximized as much as possible, although sometimes formulation considerations (e.g. drug stability) may necessitate less than optimal comfort. In the case that comfort cannot be maximized, the liquid should be formulated such that the liquid is tolerable to the patient for topical ophthalmic use. Additionally, an ophthalmically acceptable liquid should either be packaged for single use, or contain a preservative to prevent contamination over multiple uses.
For ophthalmic application, solutions or medicaments are often prepared using a physiological saline solution as a major vehicle. Ophthalmic solutions can be maintained at a comfortable pH with an appropriate buffer system. The formulations may also contain conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives, stabilizers and surfactants.
