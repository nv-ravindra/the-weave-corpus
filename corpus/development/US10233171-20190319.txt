FIELD OF INVENTION
The present invention provides, inter alia, a compound having the structure: Also provided are compositions containing the compounds of the present invention, as well as methods of using the compounds and compositions of the present invention.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Cell death is crucial for normal development, homeostasis and the prevention of hyper-proliferative diseases such as cancer (Fuchs and Steller, 2011; Thompson, 1995). It was once thought that almost all regulated cell death in mammalian cells resulted from the activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis (Fuchs and Steller, 2011; Thompson, 1995). More recently this view has been challenged by the discovery of several regulated non-apoptotic cell death pathways activated in specific disease states, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and apoptosis inducing factor 1 (AIF1)-dependent parthanatos, caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis and receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)-dependent necroptosis (Bergsbaken et al., 2009; Christofferson and Yuan, 2010; Wang et al., 2009). It is believed that additional regulated forms of non-apoptotic cell death likely remain to be discovered that mediate cell death in other developmental or pathological circumstances.
The RAS family small GTPases (HRAS, NRAS and KRAS) are mutated in about 30% of all cancers (Vigil et al., 2010). Finding compounds that are selectively lethal to RAS-mutant tumor cells is, therefore, a high priority. Two structurally unrelated small molecules, named erastin and RSL3, were previously identified. These molecules were selectively lethal to oncogenic RAS-mutant cell lines, and together, they were referred to as RAS-selective lethal (RSL) compounds (Dolma et al., 2003; Yang and Stockwell, 2008). Using affinity purification, voltage dependent anion channels 2 and 3 (VDAC2/3) were identified as direct targets of erastin (Yagoda et al., 2007), but not RSL3. ShRNA and cDNA overexpression studies demonstrated that VDAC2 and VDAC3 are necessary, but not sufficient, for erastin-induced death (Yagoda et al., 2007), indicating that additional unknown targets are required for this process.
The type of cell death activated by the RSLs has been enigmatic. Classic features of apoptosis, such as mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase activation and chromatin fragmentation, are not observed in RSL-treated cells (Dolma et al., 2003; Yagoda et al., 2007; Yang and Stockwell, 2008). RSL-induced death is, however, associated with increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is prevented by iron chelation or genetic inhibition of cellular iron uptake (Yagoda et al., 2007; Yang and Stockwell, 2008). In a recent systematic study of various mechanistically unique lethal compounds, the prevention of cell death by iron chelation was a rare phenomenon (Wolpaw et al., 2011), suggesting that few triggers can access iron-dependent lethal mechanisms.
Accordingly, there is a need for the exploration of various pathways of regulated cell death, as well as for compositions and methods for preventing the occurrence of regulated cell death. This invention is directed to meeting these and other needs.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Without being bound to a particular theory, the inventors hypothesized that RSLs, such as erastin, activate a lethal pathway that is different from apoptosis, necrosis and other well-characterized types of regulated cell death. It was found that erastin-induced death involves a unique constellation of morphological, biochemical and genetic features, which led to the name “ferroptosis” as a description for this phenotype. Small molecule inhibitors of ferroptosis that prevent ferroptosis in cancer cells, as well as glutamate-induced cell death in postnatal rat brain slices have been identified and disclosed herein. The inventors have found an underlying similarity between diverse forms of iron-dependent, non-apoptotic death and that the manipulation of ferroptosis may be exploited to selectively destroy RAS-mutant tumor cells or to preserve neuronal cells exposed to specific oxidative conditions.

More generally, “pharmaceutically acceptable” means that which is useful in preparing a composition that is generally safe, non-toxic, and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable and includes that which is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use.
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well known in the art (see, e.g., Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (21st Edition, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa.) and The National Formulary (American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, D.C.)) and include sugars (e.g., lactose, sucrose, mannitol, and sorbitol), starches, cellulose preparations, calcium phosphates (e.g., dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate and calcium hydrogen phosphate), sodium citrate, water, aqueous solutions (e.g., saline, sodium chloride injection, Ringer's injection, dextrose injection, dextrose and sodium chloride injection, lactated Ringer's injection), alcohols (e.g., ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, and benzyl alcohol), polyols (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol), organic esters (e.g., ethyl oleate and tryglycerides), biodegradable polymers (e.g., polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters), and poly(anhydrides)), elastomeric matrices, liposomes, microspheres, oils (e.g., corn, germ, olive, castor, sesame, cottonseed, and groundnut), cocoa butter, waxes (e.g., suppository waxes), paraffins, silicones, talc, silicylate, etc. Each pharmaceutically acceptable carrier used in a composition of the invention must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the subject. Carriers suitable for a selected dosage form and intended route of administration are well known in the art, and acceptable carriers for a chosen dosage form and method of administration can be determined using ordinary skill in the art.
The compositions of the invention may, optionally, contain additional ingredients and/or materials commonly used in such compositions. These ingredients and materials are well known in the art and include (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid; (2) binders, such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, sucrose and acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, and sodium lauryl sulfate; (10) suspending agents, such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth; (11) buffering agents; (12) excipients, such as lactose, milk sugars, polyethylene glycols, animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, cocoa butter, starches, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycol, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc, salicylate, zinc oxide, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates, and polyamide powder; (13) inert diluents, such as water or other solvents; (14) preservatives; (15) surface-active agents; (16) dispersing agents; (17) control-release or absorption-delaying agents, such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, biodegradable polymers, liposomes, microspheres, aluminum monosterate, gelatin, and waxes; (18) opacifying agents; (19) adjuvants; (20) wetting agents; (21) emulsifying and suspending agents; (22), solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan; (23) propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane; (24) antioxidants; (25) agents which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, such as sugars and sodium chloride; (26) thickening agents; (27) coating materials, such as lecithin; and (28) sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents. Each such ingredient or material must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the subject. Ingredients and materials suitable for a selected dosage form and intended route of administration are well known in the art, and acceptable ingredients and materials for a chosen dosage form and method of administration may be determined using ordinary skill in the art.
Compositions suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, powders, granules, a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, an elixir or syrup, a pastille, a bolus, an electuary or a paste. These formulations may be prepared by methods known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional pan-coating, mixing, granulation or lyophilization processes.
Solid dosage forms for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules and the like) may be prepared, e.g., by mixing the active ingredient(s) with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and, optionally, one or more fillers, extenders, binders, humectants, disintegrating agents, solution retarding agents, absorption accelerators, wetting agents, absorbents, lubricants, and/or coloring agents. Solid compositions of a similar type maybe employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using a suitable excipient. A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using a suitable binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant, surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine. The tablets, and other solid dosage forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. The active ingredient can also be in microencapsulated form.
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically-acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. The liquid dosage forms may contain suitable inert diluents commonly used in the art. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents. Suspensions may contain suspending agents.
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which maybe prepared by mixing one or more active ingredient(s) with one or more suitable nonirritating carriers which are solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Compositions which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.
Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches, drops and inhalants. The active agent(s)/compound(s) may be mixed under sterile conditions with a suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain excipients. Powders and sprays may contain excipients and propellants.
Compositions suitable for parenteral administrations comprise one or more agent(s)/compound(s) in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain suitable antioxidants, buffers, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, or suspending or thickening agents. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain suitable adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption.
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug (e.g., pharmaceutical formulation), it is desirable to slow its absorption from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility.
The rate of absorption of the active agent/drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered agent/drug may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the active agent/drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms may be made by forming microencapsule matrices of the active ingredient in biodegradable polymers. Depending on the ratio of the active ingredient to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of active ingredient release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue. The injectable materials can be sterilized for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter.
The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampules and vials, and may be stored in a lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the type described above.
In the foregoing embodiments, the following definitions apply.
The term “alkyl” refers to the radical of saturated aliphatic groups that does not have a ring structure, including straight-chain alkyl groups, and branched-chain alkyl groups. In certain embodiments, a straight chain or branched chain alkyl has 12 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone (e.g., C1-C12 for straight chains, C3-C12 for branched chains).
Moreover, unless otherwise indicated, the term “alkyl” as used throughout the specification, examples, and claims is intended to include both “unsubstituted alkyls” and “substituted alkyls”, the latter of which refers to alkyl moieties having substituents replacing a hydrogen on one or more carbons of the hydrocarbon backbone. Indeed, unless otherwise indicated, all groups recited herein are intended to include both substituted and unsubstituted options. Such substituents can include, for example, a halogen, a hydroxyl, a carbonyl (such as a carboxyl, an alkoxycarbonyl, a formyl, or an acyl), a thiocarbonyl (such as a thioester, a thioacetate, or a thioformate), an alkoxyl, a phosphoryl, a phosphate, a phosphonate, a phosphinate, an amino, an amido, an amidine, an imine, a cyano, a nitro, an azido, a sulfhydryl, an alkylthio, a sulfate, a sulfonate, a sulfamoyl, a sulfonamido, a sulfonyl, a heterocyclyl, an aralkyl, an aromatic, or heteroaromatic moiety. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the moieties substituted on the hydrocarbon chain can themselves be substituted, if appropriate. For instance, the substituents of a substituted alkyl may include substituted and unsubstituted forms of amino, azido, imino, amido, phosphoryl (including phosphonate and phosphinate), sulfonyl (including sulfate, sulfonamido, sulfamoyl and sulfonate), and silyl groups, as well as ethers, alkylthios, carbonyls (including ketones, aldehydes, carboxylates, and esters), —CF3, —CN and the like.
The term “cycloakyl”, as used herein, refers to the radical of saturated aliphatic groups having a ring structure, including cycloalkyl (alicyclic) groups, alkyl-substituted cycloalkyl groups, and cycloalkyl-substituted alkyl groups. Certain cycloalkyls have from 3-12 carbon atoms in their ring structure, including 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 carbons in the ring structure. Cycloalkyls can be further substituted with alkyls, alkenyls, alkoxys, alkylthios, aminoalkyls, carbonyl-substituted alkyls, —CF3, —CN, and the like. As used herein, the “pendant group” of a cycloalkyl refers to any atom(s) or functional group(s) that are attached to the ring atom.
The term “Cx-y” when used in conjunction with a chemical moiety, such as, alkyl and cycloalkyl, is meant to include groups that contain from x to y carbons in the chain. For example, the term “Cx-yalkyl” refers to substituted or unsubstituted saturated hydrocarbon groups, including straight-chain alkyl and branched-chain alkyl groups that contain from x to y carbons in the chain, including haloalkyl groups such as trifluoromethyl and 2,2,2-tirfluoroethyl, etc.
The term “aryl” as used herein includes substituted or unsubstituted single-ring aromatic groups in which each atom of the ring is carbon, or nitrogen (if ring carbons are substituted). Preferably the ring is a 3- to 8-membered ring, more preferably a 6-membered ring. The term “aryl” also includes polycyclic ring systems having two or more cyclic rings in which two or more carbons are common to two adjoining rings wherein at least one of the rings is aromatic, e.g., the other cyclic rings can be cycloalkyls, cycloalkenyls, cycloalkynyls, aryls, heteroaryls, and/or heterocyclyls. Aryl groups include benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenol, aniline, and the like.
The term “alkyl-aryl” refers to an alkyl group substituted with at least one aryl group. As used herein, the “pendant group” of a alkyl-aryl refers to any atom(s) or functional group(s) that are attached to the ring atom.

The term “ester” as used herein, includes the group —C(O)OR7 wherein R7 represents a hydrocarbyl group, including C1-3 alkyl.
The term “ether”, as used herein, refers to a hydrocarbyl group linked through an oxygen to another hydrocarbyl group. Accordingly, an ether substituent of a hydrocarbyl group may be hydrocarbyl-O—. Ethers may be either symmetrical or unsymmetrical, and substituted or unsubstituted. Specifically included in this definition is the group C1-3alkyl-O—C1-3alkyl-R, where R is NH2 or NHBoc. An example of such a group is —CH2CH2—O—CH2—CH2—NH2. Examples of ethers include, but are not limited to, alkyl-O-alkyl, heterocycle-O-heterocycle and aryl-O-heterocycle. Ethers also include “alkoxy” groups, which may be represented by the general formula —O-alky, as well as “alkoxyalkyl” groups, which may be represented by the general formula alkyl-O-alkyl.
The terms “halo” and “halogen” are used interchangeably herein and mean halogen and include chloro, fluoro, bromo, and iodo.
The term “heteroatom” as used herein means an atom of any element other than carbon or hydrogen. Preferred heteroatoms are nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur; more preferably, nitrogen and oxygen.
The term “substituted” refers to moieties having substituents replacing a hydrogen on one or more carbons of the backbone. It will be understood that “substitution” or “substituted with” includes the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with the permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., which does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc. As used herein, the term “substituted” is contemplated to include all permissible substituents of organic compounds. In a broad aspect, the permissible substituents include acyclic and cyclic, branched and unbranched, carbocyclic and heterocyclic, aromatic and non-aromatic substituents of organic compounds. The permissible substituents can be one or more and the same or different for appropriate organic compounds. For purposes of this invention, the heteroatoms such as nitrogen may have hydrogen substituents and/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which satisfy the valences of the heteroatoms. Substituents can include any substituents described herein, for example, a halogen, a hydroxyl, a carbonyl (such as a carboxyl, an alkoxycarbonyl, a formyl, or an acyl), a thiocarbonyl (such as a thioester, a thioacetate, or a thioformate), an alkoxyl, a phosphoryl, a phosphate, a phosphonate, a phosphinate, an amino, an amido, an amidine, an imine, a cyano, a nitro, an azido, a sulfhydryl, an alkylthio, a sulfate, a sulfonate, a sulfamoyl, a sulfonamido, a sulfonyl, a heterocyclyl, an aralkyl, or an aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the moieties substituted on the hydrocarbon chain can themselves be substituted, if appropriate.
As used herein, the term “substituent,” means H, cyano, oxo, nitro, acyl, acylamino, halogen, hydroxy, amino acid, amine, amide, carbamate, ester, ether, carboxylic acid, thio, thioalkyl, thioester, thioether, C1-8 alkyl, C1-8alkoxy, C1-8alkenyl, C1-8aralkyl, 3- to 12-membered carbocyclic, 3- to 12-membered heterocyclic, 3- to 8-membered aryl, or 3- to 8-membered heteroaryl, sulfate, sulfonamide, sulfoxide, sulfonate, sulfone, alkylsulfonyl, and arylsulfonyl.
As set forth previously, unless specifically stated as “unsubstituted,” references to chemical moieties herein are understood to include substituted variants. For example, reference to an “aryl” group or moiety implicitly includes both substituted and unsubstituted variants.
It is understood that the disclosure of a compound herein encompasses all stereoisomers of that compound. As used herein, the term “stereoisomer” refers to a compound made up of the same atoms bonded by the same bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable. The three-dimensional structures are called configurations. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers.
The terms “racemate” or “racemic mixture” refer to a mixture of equal parts of enantiomers. The term “chiral center” refers to a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached. The term “enantiomeric enrichment” as used herein refers to the increase in the amount of one enantiomer as compared to the other.
It is appreciated that to the extent compounds of the present invention have a chiral center, they may exist in and be isolated in optically active and racemic forms. Some compounds may exhibit polymorphism. It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses any racemic, optically-active, diastereomeric, polymorphic, or stereoisomeric form, or mixtures thereof, of a compound of the invention, which possess the useful properties described herein, it being well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms (for example, by resolution of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques, by synthesis from optically-active starting materials, by chiral synthesis, or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase).
Examples of methods to obtain optically active materials are known in the art, and include at least the following:
i) physical separation of crystals—a technique whereby macroscopic crystals of the individual enantiomers are manually separated. This technique can be used if crystals of the separate enantiomers exist, i.e., the material is a conglomerate, and the crystals are visually distinct;
ii) simultaneous crystallization—a technique whereby the individual enantiomers are separately crystallized from a solution of the racemate, possible only if the latter is a conglomerate in the solid state;
iii) enzymatic resolutions—a technique whereby partial or complete separation of a racemate by virtue of differing rates of reaction for the enantiomers with an enzyme;
iv) enzymatic asymmetric synthesis—a synthetic technique whereby at least one step of the synthesis uses an enzymatic reaction to obtain an enantiomerically pure or enriched synthetic precursor of the desired enantiomer;
v) chemical asymmetric synthesis—a synthetic technique whereby the desired enantiomer is synthesized from an achiral precursor under conditions that produce asymmetry (i.e., chirality) in the product, which may be achieved using chiral catalysts as disclosed in more detail herein or chiral auxiliaries;
vi) diastereomer separations—a technique whereby a racemic compound is reacted with an enantiomerically pure reagent (the chiral auxiliary) that converts the individual enantiomers to diastereomers. The resulting diastereomers are then separated by chromatography or crystallization by virtue of their now more distinct structural differences and the chiral auxiliary later removed to obtain the desired enantiomer;
vii) first- and second-order asymmetric transformations—a technique whereby diastereomers from the racemate equilibrate to yield a preponderance in solution of the diastereomer from the desired enantiomer or where preferential crystallization of the diastereomer from the desired enantiomer perturbs the equilibrium such that eventually in principle all the material is converted to the crystalline diastereomer from the desired enantiomer. The desired enantiomer is then released from the diastereomer;
viii) kinetic resolutions—this technique refers to the achievement of partial or complete resolution of a racemate (or of a further resolution of a partially resolved compound) by virtue of unequal reaction rates of the enantiomers with a chiral, non-racemic reagent or catalyst under kinetic conditions;
ix) enantiospecific synthesis from non-racemic precursors—a synthetic technique whereby the desired enantiomer is obtained from non-chiral starting materials and where the stereochemical integrity is not or is only minimally compromised over the course of the synthesis;
x) chiral liquid chromatography—a technique whereby the enantiomers of a racemate are separated in a liquid mobile phase by virtue of their differing interactions with a stationary phase. The stationary phase can be made of chiral material or the mobile phase can contain an additional chiral material to provoke the differing interactions;
xi) chiral gas chromatography—a technique whereby the racemate is volatilized and enantiomers are separated by virtue of their differing interactions in the gaseous mobile phase with a column containing a fixed non-racemic chiral adsorbent phase;
xii) extraction with chiral solvents—a technique whereby the enantiomers are separated by virtue of preferential dissolution of one enantiomer into a particular chiral solvent;
xiii) transport across chiral membranes—a technique whereby a racemate is placed in contact with a thin membrane barrier. The barrier typically separates two miscible fluids, one containing the racemate, and a driving force such as concentration or pressure differential causes preferential transport across the membrane barrier. Separation occurs as a result of the non-racemic chiral nature of the membrane which allows only one enantiomer of the racemate to pass through.
The stereoisomers may also be separated by usual techniques known to those skilled in the art including fractional crystallization of the bases or their salts or chromatographic techniques such as LC or flash chromatography. The (+) enantiomer can be separated from the (−) enantiomer using techniques and procedures well known in the art, such as that described by J. Jacques, et al., antiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1981. For example, chiral chromatography with a suitable organic solvent, such as ethanol/acetonitrile and Chiralpak AD packing, 20 micron can also be utilized to effect separation of the enantiomers.
The following examples are provided to further illustrate the methods of the present invention. These examples are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.

Experimental Procedures
Analysis of Reactive Oxygen Species Production
The day before the experiment, 200,000 cells/well were seeded in 6-well dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, N.Y.). The day of the experiment, cells were treated with test compounds for the indicated times, then harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in 500 μL Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Gibco, Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.) containing either H2DCFDA (25 μM), C11-BODIPY (581/591) (2 μM) or MitoSOX (5 μM) (all from Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) and incubated for 10 minutes at 37° C. in a tissue culture incubator. Cells were then resuspended in 500 μL of fresh HBSS, strained through a 40 μM cell strainer (BD Falcon, BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.), and analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur or Accuri C6, BD Biosciences), which was equipped with 488-nm laser for excitation. Data was collected from the FL1 (H2DCFDA, C11-BODIPY) or FL2 channel (MitoSOX). A minimum of 10,000 cells were analyzed per condition.
Cancer Cell Viability Measurements
Cell viability was typically assessed in 384-well format by Alamar Blue (Invitrogen) fluorescence (ex/em 530/590) measured on a Victor3 platereader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.). In some experiments, Trypan Blue dye exclusion counting was performed using an automated cell counter (ViCell, Beckman-Coulter Inc., Brea, Calif.). Cell viability in test conditions is reported as a percentage relative to the negative control treatment.
shRNA Screening
An arrayed collection of 6,528 shRNA hairpins derived from The RNAi Consortium (TRC) collection targeting 1,087 genes, kindly provided by Vamsi Mootha and Joshua Baughman (MIT), was screened in 384-well plate format (Corning) using both Calu-1 and HT-1080 cells. ShRNAs targeting GFP and RFP, randomly distributed through each plate, served as negative controls. 400 cells per well were infected in duplicate for 48 hours with 2 μL shRNA-containing viral supernatant, selected for 24 hours in puromycin (1.5 μg/mL), then treated with DMSO, erastin (7.3 μM) or staurosporine (STS) (1 μM) for 24 hours. Cell viability was determined using Alamar Blue. For each hairpin within each treatment condition, a cell death rescue score was computed as the ratio of the average viability of the two replicates to the average viability of the within-plate negative controls. These scores were used to compare the effects between compounds. To identify genes required for ferroptosis, individual hairpins were scored as hits if they displayed an average death suppression ≥3 median average deviations from the median within-plate or screen-wide negative control values. 51 candidate genes were identified with the same two (or more) unique hairpins per gene called as hits in both the Calu-1 and HT-1080 screens. For each candidate gene, confirmation studies using RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA silencing was performed in HT-1080 cells using freshly prepared virus as described in more detail below.
[14C]Cystine Uptake Assay
200,000 HT-1080 cells/well were seeded overnight in 6-well dishes (Corning). The next day, cells were washed twice in pre-warmed Na+-free uptake buffer (137 mM choline chloride, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM D-glucose, 0.7 mM K2HPO4, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), then incubated for 10 minutes at 37° C. in 1 mL of uptake buffer, to deplete cellular amino acids. At this point, in each well the buffer was replaced with 600 μL uptake buffer containing compound and 0.12 μCi (80-110 mCi/mmol) of L-[3,3′-14C]-cystine (Perkin Elmer) and incubated for 3 minutes at 37° C. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold uptake buffer and lysed in 500 μL 0.1 M NaOH. To this lysate was added 15 mL of scintillation fluid and radioactive counts per minute were obtained using a scintillation counter. All measurements were performed in triplicate for each condition.

When used for transfections to generate virus, 293-T cells were seeded in the above media lacking antibiotics. 293-T viral collection media contained 30% HyClone FBS. MEFs were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 143B cells were grown in DMEM High-Glucose supplemented with 10% FBS. 143B ρ0 cells were grown in the above media supplemented with 100 μg/mL uridine. The rho zero status of the 143B ρ0 cell lines was confirmed using RT-qPCR by showing little or no mRNA expression for 7 mtDNA-encoded transcripts in the ρ0 cell lines. All cell lines were grown in humidified tissue culture incubators (Thermo Scientific) at 37° C. with 5% CO2. Except where indicated, all medias were supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco).

ATP levels were evaluated using the ApoSENSOR ATP Assay Kit (Biovision Inc., Milpitas, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2000 HT-1080 or BJeLR cells were seeded in 96-well white bottom plates (Falcon). Cells were treated 12 hours later with compound as above for the TEM. Prior to luminescence measurement, medium was removed and cells were lysed and incubated with ATP Monitoring Enzyme. Luminescence was measured using a Victor3 platereader equipped with an infrared emission filter every 30 seconds for 10 minutes. Typically the first reading was used for data analysis. Parallel cell culture treatments were performed in 96-well clear bottom plates and cell viability was determined using Alamar Blue. These values were used to normalize ATP levels to cell viability.
Modulatory Profiling of Small Molecule Inhibitors
The following small molecule inhibitors were tested in a ten-point, four-fold dilution series for their ability to prevent erastin-induced death in HT-1080, Calu-1 and BJ-eLR cells (high dose of dilution series in brackets): carbobenzyloxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk, 184 μM), necrostatin-1 (Nec-1, 19.3 μM), cyclosporine A (CspA, 33.2 μM), N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN, 40 μM), (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (E64d, 400 μM), bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1, 4 μM), 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 6.25 mM), chloroquine (Chq, 250 μM), deferoxamine (DFO, 400), 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (trolox, 320 μM), 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis (2-aminophenylthio)butadiene (U0126, 52.4 μM) and cycloheximide (5.6 μM). The day before the experiment, cells were seeded in black, 384-well clear bottom plates (Corning) at a density of 1,000 cells/well using a Beckman Biomek FX Workstation. All compounds (except 3-methyladenine and chloroquine, which were diluted in water) were diluted in DMSO at 250 times the final highest test concentration, and aliquoted across a 384-well plate (Greiner, Monroe, N.C.). A ten-point, 4-fold dilution series of each inhibitor in DMSO was made using a multichannel pipette. Replicates of this mother plate were stored at −20° C. On the day of the experiment, a fresh inhibitor plate was thawed and diluted 25-fold into DMEM in a 384 deep well ‘daughter’ plate (Greiner), using a Biomek FX. Medium was removed from cells and replaced with 36 μL medium containing DMSO (0.1%) or erastin (10 μM final concentration). Using the Biomek FX, 4 μL were then transferred from each inhibitor daughter plate into the DMSO-containing or erastin-containing assay plates. For 3-methyladenine and chloroquine, inhibitors were prepared fresh in media at 10-fold the final concentration in the presence of DMSO or 10 μM erastin. These solutions were manually pipetted onto cells in 384-well format. Assay plates were incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours. Viability was assessed using Alamar Blue.
Computation of Modulatory Effects
The modulatory effect (Me) for drug-drug interactions was computed as follows. First, plate-based background correction was performed using Alamar Blue values from empty (cell-free) wells included on each plate. Next, within each experiment, 100% viability is determined as the average Alamar Blue score for cells treated with modulator=DMSO and lethal=DMSO, and all Alamar Blue values were scaled from 0 to 1 with the DMSO×DMSO condition=1. The individual effects of each modulator and lethal (e.g. in the presence of DMSO) at all tested doses were then ascertained. Using these data, the “expected” effect on viability (BExp) for each modulator (M)×lethal (L) combination were modeled using the Bliss formula for drug interactions (M+L−M*L). Next, BExp was compared to the actual observed viability. For each informative drug-drug interaction (i.e. modulator=“DFO”, modulator concentration=100 μM, lethal=Erastin) the modulatory effect (Me) was equivalent to the maximum observed deviation, positive or negative, from BExp. By default, Me in DMSO-treated cells is equal to 0. This formula was empirically determined to provide a useful measure of modulation that is robust to differences in the shapes of individual dose-response curves for different inhibitors and lethal molecules. Me values for each inhibitor-lethal drug combination were hierarchically clustered and plotted as a heatmap using the heatmaps.2 function of the gplots library in R.
Modulatory Profile of Lethal Small Molecules
The following lethal molecules were compared in a ten-point, two-fold dilution series modulatory profiling assay (high dose of dilution series in brackets): erastin (20 μM), RSL3 (5 μM), hydrogen peroxide (H202, 5 mM), artesunate (200 μM), phenylarsine oxide (PAO, 1 μM), taxol (0.5 μM), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, 50 μM), trichostatin A (2.5 μM), doxorubicin (2 μM), fenretinide (50 μM), staurosporine (STS, 0.5 μM), brefeldin A (10 μM), β-lapachone (25 μM), bortezomib (5 μM), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP, 50 μM), 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME, 50 μM), rotenone (2 μM), helenaline (50 μM), sulfasalazine (SAS, 1 mM) and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC, 50 μM).
The comparative analysis of the lethal effects of various molecules was conducted as above for the inhibitors experiment with the following modifications. All lethal molecules were tested in a ten point, two-fold dilution series. Inhibitors were made in media at 1× final concentration. The growth media was removed from the plates, and 36 μL media+inhibitor (or DMSO) was added back to the plate+4 μL from the 10× lethal stock plate. Cell viability and modulatory effects (Me) were computed as above, to obtain the maximum deviation from BExp produced by each modulator across the different lethal small molecule concentrations.
Arrayed shRNA Screen: Data Analysis and Hit Selection.
ShRNA screening and follow-up studies identified 51 initial candidate suppressor genes, each represented by 2 hairpins common to both cell lines. These candidates were re-tested. For 50 of these genes, fresh virus (see below) was prepared for the top two scoring shRNA hairpins. The resistance in HT-1080 cells infected with these hairpins in response to up to 10 μM erastin was re-tested. In parallel, target knockdown was validated for each shRNA hairpin by RT-qPCR. From the initial set of suppressor genes, high confidence genes were selected using the following criteria: (1) the degree of death suppression was consistent across two independent replicates in the re-testing phase; (2) the level of death suppression was at least 50% of that observed in the sh263-VDAC3 positive control at the highest dose of erastin (10 μM); (3) at least one of two shRNA hairpins must reduce the level of mRNA <50% of control, and (4) an inverse correlation must exist between erastin resistance and mRNA levels (providing a strong measure of confidence in the on-target nature of the shRNAs used). Finally, whether each hairpin had been reported as independently validated was determined on The RNAi Consortium/Sigma website. By intersecting the results of these confirmatory analyses, a final set of six high confidence genes was determined.
Arrayed shRNA Screen: shRNA Confirmation
For all candidate suppressors, individual “hit” shRNA hairpin sequences were non-overlapping (e.g. targeting unique sequences within the mRNA) and were confirmed using the siRNA-Check tool available from In Silico Solutions (Fairfax, Va.). Individual shRNAs are identified by the 3 or 4 number Clone ID suffixes assigned to each mRNA target sequences by TRC.
New virus were produced to validate erastin resistance and perform downstream analyses of target knockdown and functional effects in a 6-well format as follows. On Day 1, 170,000 293-T cells were seeded in antibiotic-free media into each well of a 6-well dish. On Day 2, these cells were transfected (Fugene, Roche) with 450 ng of shRNA plasmid DNA, 400 ng of pDelta8.9 helper plasmid and 45 ng of pVSVg helper plasmid. On Day 3, the media was switched to viral collection media. Virus was harvested the following morning and evening of Day 4 and then a final time the next morning of Day 5. The collected media was pooled, spun at 2,000 rpm for 5 minutes and the virus-containing supernatant aliquoted and stored at −80° C. This protocol was used for the production of virus in all other small-scale shRNA experiments as well (i.e. FIGS. 7C and 7D ).
Six-well dish infections were performed as follows. On Day 1, 30,000 HT-1080 cells were seeded per well. On day 2, cells were infected with 150 μL of viral supernatant and spin infected as for 384-well plates.
Genetic Screeninq Follow-up Experiments: Cell Line and Lethal Compound Specificity Analysis
These experiments were performed for all cell lines. Lethal compound experiments were performed in parallel by first re-arraying by hand virus prepared as described above for all suppressor hairpins in a single 384 deep well viral “mother plate” (Corning), including 3 independent copies of the negative control and positive controls (sh-Control and sh263-VDAC3). Each hairpin was arrayed in a block of 6 wells (2 across×3 down). For each experiment, cells were seeded at a standard density of 400 cells/well on Day 1. On Day 2, the media was removed either by flicking, (for HT-1080 cells in the lethal compound analysis) or using a BioMek FX (for the cell line analysis), and then replaced with 38 μl media containing 1× polybrene (8 μg/ml) using the BioMek. 2 μl viral soup was then transferred from each well of the viral mother plate to each well of the assay plate and a spin infection was performed as described above. On Day 3 (for the analysis of cell lines) or Day 4 (for the analysis of lethal compounds), the media+virus was removed using the BioMek and replaced with media+1.5 μg/ml puromycin. Next, for both experiments, on Day 5, the media was again removed using the BioMek and replaced with media+lethal compound. On Day 6, Alamar Blue was added as described above and the signal was measured 6 hours later. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results and representative data from one experiment is shown. Data for the best hairpin as defined by mRNA silencing levels in HT-1080 cells is disclosed herein. Similar results were obtained with the second best hairpins.
Reverse Transcription-Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR)
RNA was extracted using the Qiashredder and Qiagen RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μg total RNA for each sample was used as input for each reverse transcription reaction, performed using the TaqMan RT kit (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.). Primer pairs were designed for target transcripts using Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR reactions were performed using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Triplicate samples per condition were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 7300 qPCR instrument using absolute quantification settings. Differences in mRNA levels compared to HPRT1 or ACTB internal reference control were computed between control and experimental conditions using the ΔΔCt method.
LOC Library Construction
The LOC (Lead Optimized Compound) library is composed of 9,517 compounds selected from a starting pool of 3,372,615 compounds available through a variety of commercial libraries (Asinex, Moscow, Russia; Life Chemicals, Burlington, ON, Canada; Enamine Ltd., Kiev, Ukrain; TimTec, Newark, Del.; InterBioScreen Ltd., Moscow, Russia; Chembridge Corp., San Diego, Calif.). The starting pool was generated in silico by downloading structure files for available compounds from all vendors. From this pool, the application of Lipinski's rules (Lipinski et al., 2001) and other relevant physicochemical descriptors consistent with drug-like candidates (molecular weight>235, number of rotatable bonds<5, topological polar surface area<70 Å2, aqueous solubility>0.5 mM) reduced the total number of compounds to 58,786. The total number of compounds was further reduced to 45,395 by filtering out compounds containing nitro and nitroso groups, reactive moieties, ketones and aldehydes, imines, scaffolds unsuitable for further modification, organometallic compounds and thiols. From this set, the final collection was derived by eliminating multiple copies of highly similar compounds (Tanimoto coefficient). All computational analyses were performed using MOE2008.10 (Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada) on a MacPro with 2×2.93 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon CPUs. At this point, 5 mg of each compound was obtained from their respective suppliers and dissolved in DMSO at a standard concentration of 4 mg/mL. Aliquots of each compound were then arrayed into individual wells of several 384 shallow well “mother” plates (Grenier) using a BioMek liquid handling robot and frozen at −80° C. until use.
LOC Library Screening
The LOC library was screened over the course of several days. 384-well glass bottom assay plates (Corning) were seeded with 1,000 HT-1080 cells/well the day before the experiment. The day of the experiment, LOC mother plates were thawed at room temperature for 1 hour and spun at 1000 rpm for 1 minute prior to use. Using a BioMek liquid handing robot, 2 μL of compound solution from each LOC library mother plate was transferred to a 384 deep well “daughter” plate (Grenier) containing 148 μL of cell culture media. The cell culture media in each assay plate was then removed by flicking and, using a BioMek FX, replaced with 36 μL of growth media containing erastin (5 μM final). To this was added 4 μL of the drug solution from the daughter plate, for a final screening concentration of 5.3 μg/mL for each LOC library compound. 4 wells containing DMSO alone (no erastin), 4 wells containing 100 μM DFO alone (no erastin), 4 wells containing erastin plus DMSO, and 4 wells containing erastin plus 100 μM DFO (positive control) were included as controls on each plate. Each drug daughter plate was aliquoted separately to duplicate assay plates. Plates were then spun briefly (1000 rpm, 5 seconds) and returned to the 37° C. tissue culture incubator. 24 hours later, cell viability was assessed by Alamar Blue as described above.
LOC Library Screen Hit Identification and Confirmation
Candidate hits from the LOC library screen were identified. First, values for each duplicate screening plate were averaged. Next, a growth rescue score consisting of the ratio of the viability of each LOC compound+erastin versus the DMSO+erastin treatment within each plate was computed. These plate-based growth rescue scores were rank ordered from highest to lowest. The top 336 ranked compounds, derived from the same LOC library plates used for screening, were then re-tested in HT-1080 cells in a 10-point, 2-fold dilution series against erastin (5 μM) as described above for the modulatory profiling experiments. For the top 50 most potent compound inhibitors of erastin-induced death identified in this experiment, fresh compound in powder form was re-ordered from the respective vendors, the powder was re-dissolved in DMSO as above, and the 10-point, 2-fold dilution series experiment in HT-1080 cells repeated. Fer-1 proved to be the most potent of the re-tested compounds in this experiment and was selected for more detailed study.
Western Blotting
Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and washed once in PBS. Cells were lysed for 20 minutes in buffer containing: 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 40 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor tablet (Roche, Nutley, N.J.). Unlysed cells and debris were pelleted for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 4° C., and the supernatant was removed and mixed with 5×SDS loading buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western transfer was performed using the iBlot system (Invitrogen). Membrane was blocked for 1 hour in Licor Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) and incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4° C. Following three 5-minute washes in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with 1% Tween-20 (TBS-T), membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies for 45 minutes in the dark. The membrane was washed again in TBST for three 5-minute washes with protection from light and scanned using the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR). Antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-phospho p42/44 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, #9101) and rabbit anti-p42/44 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, #9102). The secondary antibody was IR dye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR).
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay
The stable radical DPPH (Blois, 1958) was dissolved in methanol to a final concentration of 0.05 mM. 1 mL of DPPH solution was added to 2 μL of each test compound dissolved in DMSO. The final concentration of each test compound was 0.05 mM. Samples were inverted several times and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. Samples were then aliquoted to white 96-well solid-bottom dishes (Corning) and absorbance at 517 nm was recorded using a TECAN M200 plate reader. All values were normalized to background (methanol only). The experiment was repeated twice. Results within each trial normalized to DMSO (=1.0), then averaged across trials.
Analysis of Cell Death in Rat Brain Slices: Organotypic Hippocampal Slice Cultures (OHSCs)
OHSCs were cultured as previously described (Morrison et al., 2002) with approval from Columbia University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Briefly, Sprague Dawley rat pups (P8-P10) were rapidly decapitated, and the hippocampus placed in ice-cold Gey's balanced salt solution (Sigma). 400 μm thick sections were cut using a Mcllwain tissue chopper and immediately plated on Millicell cell culture inserts (Millipore, Billerica, Mass.) in Neurobasal (Invitrogen) media supplemented with B27 (1×, Invitrogen), GlutaMAX (1 mM, Invitrogen), and D-glucose (4.5 mg/mL, Sigma) at 37° C. and 5% CO2. After 2 days in vitro (DIV), the media was changed to medium containing serum comprised of 50% DMEM (Sigma), 25% heat-inactivated horse serum (Sigma), 25% Hank's balanced salt solution (Sigma), GlutaMAX (1 mM, Invitrogen), and D-glucose (4.5 mg/mL, Sigma). Medium was changed every 2-3 days.
Analysis of Cell Death in Rat Brain Slices: Excitotoxic Injury
After 10-14 DIV, OBSCs were exposed to an excitotoxic injury consisting of a 3 hour exposure to 5 mM L-glutamate in SFM (Morrison et al., 2002). Only healthy OHSCs defined as those with less than 5% cell death in all regions of the hippocampus (DG, CA3, CA1) pre-injury were used for experiments. After the 3 hour exposure, the cultures were placed in fresh serum free media (SFM) containing 75% DMEM, 25% Hank's balanced salt solution, GlutaMAX (1 mM), D-glucose (4.5 mg/mL) until cell death was quantified at 24 hours. If drugs were added, they were added at the same time as glutamate.
Analysis of Cell Death in Rat Brain Slices: Cell Death Assessment
Quantification of cell death has been described previously (Cater et al., 2007; Morrison et al., 2002). Brightfield images of the hippocampal cultures were taken before injury for identification of regions of interest (ROI) including the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and CA1. Propidium iodide (PI, Invitrogen) was used as a fluorescent signal for cell death, and images were taken before the induction of injury and 24 hours following injury. For PI imaging, the cultures were transferred to SFM supplemented with 5 μg/mL PI. After a 30 minute incubation, brightfield and PI images were acquired. All images were captured on an Olympus IX-80 fluorescent microscope fitted with a 175 W Xenon Arc lamp (Perkin Elmer), CoolSNAP ES camera (Photometrics, Tucson, Ariz.), and standard rhodamine optics (excitation 556-580 nm; emission 590-630 nm; PI exposure 2 seconds, brightfield exposure 3 miliseconds). Metamorph image analysis software was used to determine the ROI in the brightfield image, and this ROI was transferred to the PI image taken before and 24 hours after injury. Percentage cell death was expressed as the number of pixels in the ROI above a threshold in the PI fluorescent image divided by the total number of pixels in the ROI.
Oncogenic-RAS-Selective Lethal Assay
Analysis of oncogenic-RAS-selective lethality in BJeH, BJeHLT, BJeLR and DRD cells was performed as described previously (Yang and Stockwell, 2008).
siRNA Gene Silencing
All siRNAs were obtained from Qiagen. 50,000 HT-1080 cells were seeded in antibiotic-free HT-1080 media into each well of a 6-well tissue culture dish (Corning) the day before the start of the experiment. The next day, cells were transfected with 2 nM of siRNAs (final concentration/well) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The media was replaced with fresh antibiotic-containing HT-1080 media the following day. Parallel cultures were assayed for gene expression after 48 hours using RT-qPCR and for cell viability in response to drug treatment at 72 hours post-transfection.
Plasmids and Transfection
pMaxGFP plasmid was from Amaxa (Lonza Group Ltd., Basel, Switzerland). pCMV6-SLC7A11-DDK was from Origene Technologies (Rockville, Md.). 50,000 HT-1080 cells were seeded in 6-well dishes (Corning) the day before the experiment in regular HT-1080 media. The next day, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg plasmid DNA/well using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 72 hours post-transfection, cell viability was assessed by microscopy in response to erastin and sulfasalazine.
Identification of SLC7A5 as an Erastin Target in BJeH and BJeLR Cells
Affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to identify proteins that bound an active (lethal) erastin analog (erastin-A6) and an inactive control (erastin-B2) in lysates from oncogenic HRAS-mutant BJeLR cells and HRAS-wild-type BJeH cells (2 independent experimental replicates for each cell line) (Yagoda et al., 2007). Previously, the analyses on targets bound by active erastin-A6 were done in BJeLR versus BJeH cells, on the assumption that such targets were most likely to mediate oncogenic-RAS-selective lethality (Yagoda et al., 2007). However, given that erastin was lethal to various cells, including some that lack mutant HRAS, the data were re-analyzed in order to look for targets bound by active erastin-A6 (but not inactive erastin-B2) in both cells types, as follows. First the two experimental replicates were merged on the basis of protein reference IDs to identify high confidence targets for each erastin analog in both cell lines. Any proteins also bound by inactive erastin-B2 (i.e. non-specific interactions) were then eliminated from the erastin-A6 target lists. Next, the lists of proteins uniquely bound by active erastin-A6 in BJeH cells (gi|4506675 [RPN1], gi|4505773 [PHB], gi|1174469 [STT3A], gi|14017819 [LRRIQ1], gi|12643412 [SLC7A5]) and BJeLR cells (gi|1172554 [VDAC2], gi|19923753 [SLC16A1], gi|11281610 [TECR], gi|23308572 [MBOAT7], gi|4759086 [SEC22B], gi|7448310 [TSPO], gi|4507943 [XPO1], gi|21361181 [ATP1A1], gi|29029559 [CSEL1], gi|23308577 [PHGDH], gi|1362789 [PRKDC], gi|12643412 [SLC7A5]) were compared. This new analysis identified SLC7A5 as the lone protein bound by active erastin-A6 in both cell types. Of note, VDAC2 was identified in both experimental replicates for erastin-A6-treated BJeLR cells, but annotated with two different identifiers (gi|4507881 and gi|1172554). Also of note, SLC3A2 was identified in one replicate of erastin-A6-treated BJeLR cells.
Analysis of Metabolic Profiling Data for Erastin-treated Jurkat Cells
Ramanathan and Schreiber isolated a total of 123 metabolites from Jurkat T cells treated with erastin (1 μM, 25 minutes) or vehicle control (Ramanathan and Schreiber, 2009). These authors previously reported on a subset (11/123) of the metabolites that are specifically related to mitochondrial metabolism and glycolytic pathway function ( FIG. 6 , (Ramanathan and Schreiber, 2009)). The complete (123 metabolite) normalized dataset was obtained, and the data were ranked by the observed significance (P values) of the change in abundance between erastin-treated and control samples. The substrate specificity of system L has previously been established (Kanai and Endou, 2003).
Software
Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FloJo (9.3.2, Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, Oreg.). Chemical structures were drawn using ChemDraw Ultra (Cambridgesoft, Cambridge, Mass.). Computational determination of log P (S log P function) was performed using MOE 2010.10 (Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Calif.). Viability data was analyzed using Excel (Microsoft Corp., Seattle, Oreg.). Summary data and heatmaps were generated using R. Dose-response curves were computed by 4-parameter logistic regression in Prism 5.0c (GraphPad Software). Images were manipulated using Photoshop CS4 and Illustrator CS4 (Adobe, San Jose, Calif.).

General Synthetic Scheme General Procedure A (ArSN2 Reaction) (Beaulieu et al., 2003)
To the ethyl 4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoate (1 equiv., 200 mg, 0.871 mmol) in dry DMSO (2 mL) was added K2CO3 (2 equiv., 240.8 mg, 1.742 mmol) and various amines (1.2 equiv., 119.5 μL, 1.045 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 17 hours at 60° C. The solution was poured in water, and the organic layer was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. After drying with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the solvents were removed under vacuum. The residue was purified by flash-column chromatography on silica gel to provide the desired ethyl 4-(substituted-amino)-3-nitrobenzoate derivatives. (Tables 1-3)
General Procedure B (Hydrogenolysis)
The ethyl 4-(substituted-amino)-3-nitrobenzoates (130 mg, 0.445 mmol) were dissolved in MeOH (10 mL) and hydrogenated (H2 gas) over 10% Pd(OH)2 on charcoal (90 mg) for 17 hours at room temperature. The solution was filtered through a pad of celite, and volatiles were removed under vacuum. The residue was purified by flash-column chromatography on silica gel to provide the desired Ferrostatin-1 derivatives.
General Procedure C (Reductive Amination Reaction) (Abdel-Magid et al., 1996)
A representative example is the reductive amination of Fer-1 with benzaldehyde.
Method I: the ethyl 3-amino-4-(cyclohexylamino)benzoate (Fer-1) (100 mg, 0.382 mmol, 1 equiv) and benzaldehyde (39 μL, 0.382 mmol, 1 equiv) were heated in DCE for 1 hour at 80° C. in the presence of molecular sieve (4 Å), and then the mixture was cooled down to room temperature before addition of the NaBH(OAc)3 in small portions over 3 hours. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere for 17 hours. The reaction mixture was quenched with aqueous saturated NaHCO3, and the product was extracted with EtOAc. The EtOAc extract was dried (MgSO4), and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was purified by flash-column chromatography on silica gel to provide the desired ethyl 3-(benzylamino)-4-(cyclohexylamino)benzoate (SRS11-92, Table 7, entry 1).
Method II: To the ethyl 3-amino-4-(cyclohexylamino)benzoate (Fer-1) (100 mg, 0.382 mmol, 1 equiv) and benzaldehyde (39 μL, 0.382 mmol, 1 equiv) in DCE was added NaBH(OAc)3 (129.5 mg, 0.611 mmol, 1.6 equiv). The reaction mixture was treated in the same way as in method I.
General Procedure D (Alkylation Reaction)
A representative example is the methylation of the SRS8-70 (Table 1, entry 18) using methyl iodide. To the ethyl 3-amino-4-(cyclooctylamino)benzoate (SRS8-70; 58 mg, 0.199 mmol) in DMF (1 mL), MeI (28 μL, 0.398 mmol) and K2CO3 (82 mg, 0.508 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at 40° C. for 6 hours then poured in water. The organic layer was extracted with EtOAc then dried under MgSO4, and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was purified by flash-column chromatography on silica gel to provide the desired ethyl 4-(cyclooctylamino)-3-(dimethylamino)benzoate (SRS9-01).
General Procedure E (Addition of the Fer-1 to an Acylchloride, Alkyl-, Benzyl-chloroformates)
A representative example is the addition of aniline of the Fer-1 to the benzylchloroformate.

Example 3
Erastin Triggers Oxidative, Iron-Dependent Cell Death
RSL-induced cell death is a poorly characterized process involving the accumulation of ROS derived from an unknown source and the inhibition of cell death by iron chelation (Yagoda et al., 2007; Yang and Stockwell, 2008). It was observed that these two processes were linked. Treatment of NRAS-mutant HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells with the RSL molecule erastin (10 μM) resulted in a time-dependent increase in cytosolic and lipid ROS beginning at 2 hours, as assayed by flow cytometry using the fluorescent probes H2DCFDA and C11-BODIPY, respectively ( FIGS. 1B and 1C ). This increase in ROS preceded cell detachment and overt death, which began at 6 hours ( FIG. 1A ). ROS accumulation and cell death were suppressed by co-treatment with the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO, 100 μM) ( FIGS. 1A-C ), while incubation with three different exogenous sources of iron, but not by other divalent transition metal ions (Cu2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Co2+), potentiated erastin-induced death ( FIGS. 8A and 8B ). Because cell death occurred in erastin-treated cells following a prolonged period of ROS accumulation and was suppressed by antioxidants (see below), the data suggest that the overwhelming, iron-dependent accumulation of ROS is what kills these cells.
Because two erastin targets, VDAC2 and VDAC3, reside in the mitochondria, it was hypothesized that erastin-induced death involved aberrant ROS production by the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). However, in erastin-treated (10 μM, 6 hours) HT-1080 cells, no increase in MitoSOX-sensitive mitochondrial ROS production was observed ( FIG. 1D , left). The ETC complex I inhibitor rotenone (250 nM, 6 hours) enhanced MitoSOX-sensitive ROS production, but in a manner that was insensitive to DFO ( FIG. 1D , right). Furthermore, KRAS-mutant 143B osteosarcoma cells incapable of ETC-dependent ROS formation, due to the depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded transcripts (ρ0 cells), were as sensitive to erastin and RSL3 as matched mtDNA-wild-type (ρ+) cells ( FIGS. 1E, 1F, and 8C -E). Thus, erastin-induced cell death in human cancer cells involves DFO-sensitive ROS accumulation and can occur in cells lacking a functional ETC. This iron-dependent death phenotype was named ferroptosis.
Example 4
Ferroptosis is Distinct from Known Forms of Cell Death
Whether ferroptosis shared morphological, bioenergetic or other similarities with apoptotic or necrotic death, or with autophagy was examined. Using transmission electron microscopy, it was observed that HRAS-mutant BJeLR engineered tumor cells treated with erastin exhibited none of the characteristic morphologic features associated with staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis (e.g. chromatin condensation and margination), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced necrosis (e.g. cytoplasmic and organelle swelling, plasma membrane rupture) or rapamycin-induced autophagy (e.g. formation of double-membrane enclosed vesicles) ( FIG. 2A ). The lone distinctive morphological feature of erastin-treated cells were mitochondria that appeared smaller than normal, with increased membrane density, consistent with the previous report (Yagoda et al., 2007) ( FIG. 2A ). With respect to bioenergetics, substantial depletion of intracellular ATP in BJeLR and HT-1080 cells treated with H2O2, but not erastin, STS or rapamycin, was observed ( FIG. 2B ), thus distinguishing ferroptosis from various forms of necrosis that involve bioenergetic failure.
Using a variation of the modulatory profiling strategy (Wolpaw et al., 2011), the ability of twelve established small molecule cell death inhibitors to prevent ferroptosis in HT-1080, BJeLR and KRAS-mutant Calu-1 non-small cell lung cancer cells was tested. The modulatory effect (Me) for each inhibitor (tested in a 10-point, 4-fold dilution series) on the normalized viability of cells treated with a lethal dose of erastin (Me<0: death sensitization; Me=0: no effect; Me>0: death rescue) was computed. The resultant values were clustered hierarchically in an unsupervised fashion and displayed as a heatmap. Using this approach, it was observed that erastin-induced death was not consistently modulated by inhibitors of caspase, cathepsin or calpain proteases (z-VAD-fmk, E64d or ALLN), RIPK1 (necrostatin-1), cyclophilin D (cyclosporin A) or lysosomal function/autophagy (bafilomycin A1, 3-methyladenine, chloroquine), compounds known to inhibit various forms of apoptosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death ( FIG. 2C ).
DFO, the anti-oxidant trolox, the MEK inhibitor U0126 and, to a weaker extent, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), all rescued from erastin-induced death in HT-1080, BJeLR and Calu-1 cells ( FIG. 2C ) (Yagoda et al., 2007). These inhibitors were also effective at preventing erastin-induced ferroptosis in both wild-type and apoptosis-deficient Bax/Bak double knockout (DKO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( FIGS. 9A and 9B ), indicating that ferroptosis can be activated in human- and mouse-derived cells and is independent of the core apoptotic machinery regulated by Bax and Bak. DFO, trolox and U0126 all prevented the accumulation of H2DCFDA-sensitive ROS in erastin-treated HT-1080 cells ( FIG. 2D ), demonstrating that these inhibitors act to prevent death upstream or at the level of ROS production. Because trolox, U0126 and the membrane permeable iron chelator 2,2-bipyridyl could be added to HT-1080 cells up to 6 hours after erastin and still confer substantial protection from death ( FIG. 9C ), ferroptosis likely requires continuous iron-dependent ROS formation over an extended period of time to trigger death.
Finally, in a modulatory profiling experiment that tested the ability of DFO, trolox, U0126, CHX, the membrane permeable iron chelator ciclopirox olamine (CPX) and the glutathione peroxidase mimetic ebselen (Ebs) to modulate the lethality of erastin, RSL3 or sixteen other mechanistically distinct lethal compounds thought to kill cells through various ROS-dependent and -independent mechanisms, it was observed that erastin and RSL3 formed a distinct cluster, separate from all other inducers of cell death ( FIG. 2E ). Together, these data support the hypothesis that RSL-induced ferroptosis is a novel death phenotype distinct from apoptosis, various forms of necrosis and autophagy.
Example 5
Ferroptosis is Regulated by a Distinct Set of Genes
To explore the genetic basis of ferroptosis, genes uniquely required for this process were identify. The potential role of the mitochondria were focused on, because this organelle displayed an aberrant morphology in erastin-treated cells ( FIG. 2A ). Mitochondrial gene function was perturbed using a custom arrayed shRNA library targeting 1,087 genes (median 5 hairpins/gene), most of which (901, 88%) encode predicted mitochondrial proteins (Pagliarini et al., 2008) ( FIG. 3A ). Using this library, the genetic suppressibility of erastin (7.3 μM)-induced ferroptosis and STS (1 μM)-induced apoptosis in Calu-1 cells was compared ( FIG. 3A ). Across all 5,817 informative hairpins, no significant correlation between those shRNAs that rescued from erastin-induced ferroptosis and from STS-induced apoptosis (Spearman rank sum test, r=−0.01, P=0.46) was observed, thus confirming that distinct genetic networks govern erastin-induced ferroptosis and STS-induced apoptosis.
Next, a second erastin resistance screen in HT-1080 cells was performed and, using a rigorous confirmation pipeline, six high-confidence genes were identified. These six high-confidence genes were supported by at least two independent shRNAs per gene that are required for erastin-induced ferroptosis in both HT-1080 and Calu-1 cells-RPL8 (ribosomal protein L8), IREB2 (iron response element binding protein 2), ATP5G3 (ATP synthase F0 complex subunit C3), CS (citrate synthase), TTC35 (tetratricopeptide repeat domain 35) and ACSF2 (acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2) ( FIGS. 3B and 3C ). Consistent with the established CHX- and DFO-sensitive nature of erastin-induced ferroptosis, RPL8 encodes a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit presumably required for translation and IREB2 encodes a master regulator of iron metabolism. These results were further validated. It was found that shRNA-mediated silencing of IREB2 and the IREB2 negative regulator FBXL5 (Salahudeen et al., 2009; Vashisht et al., 2009) resulted in reciprocal changes in the expression of the known iron uptake, metabolism and storage genes TFRC, ISCU, FTH1, FTL and in erastin sensitivity ( FIG. 10A-C ). These results provide confidence in the quality of the screening and confirmation procedures.
To establish the generalizability of the results obtained in HT-1080 and Calu-1 cells, the effects of silencing these genes in HT-1080, Calu-1 and six additional cell lines treated with erastin were tested. Silencing of these six high confidence genes using the most effective hairpin for each gene, defined by mRNA silencing levels in HT-1080 cells ( FIG. 3C ), conferred ≥20% rescue in 79% (38/48) of shRNA-cell line combinations ( FIG. 3D ). Thus, these genes appear to be broadly required for erastin-induced ferroptosis. Next, whether silencing of these genes specifically attenuated erastin-induced ferroptosis, or more broadly modulated a variety of lethal effects was tested. Silencing of these six genes conferred protection against erastin-induced ferroptosis (≥40% rescue for 6/6 hairpins), but not cell death/cytostasis induced by STS, rotenone, rapamycin, the proteasome inhibitor MG132, the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin or the Ca2+-dependent ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (≥40% rescue for 0/6 hairpins) ( FIG. 3E ). Together, these data support the hypothesis that a unique genetic network governs erastin-induced ferroptosis compared to other forms of cell death.
Both ACSF2 and CS are implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism (Mullen et al., 2011; Watkins et al., 2007). Whether this process could contribute to ferroptosis was examined. In cancer cells, fatty acid synthesis is in part dependent upon the metabolism of glutamine (Gln) to alpha-ketoglutarate, a process that can be inhibited by the small molecule transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) (Wise et al., 2008) ( FIG. 3F ). In cell culture media containing both glucose and Gin, AOA (2 mM) rescued both HT-1080 and BJeLR cells from erastin-induced ferroptosis ( FIGS. 3F, 10D ), mimicking the effects of silencing CS and ACSF2. In AOA-treated HT-1080 cells, the lethality of erastin was restored by co-incubation with dimethyl alpha ketoglutarate (DMK), which provides the downstream metabolite whose production from Gin is blocked by AOA (Wise et al., 2008) ( FIGS. 3F and 3G ). An unrelated modulator of mitochondrial function not predicted to directly affect Gin metabolism, dichloroacetic acid (DCA), had no effect on erastin-induced ferroptosis ( FIG. 10D ). These results suggest that a Gln- CS- and ACSF2-dependent lipid synthesis pathway could supply a specific lipid precursor required for ferroptosis.
Example 6
Identification of Ferrostatin-1 as a Small Molecule Inhibitor of Ferroptosis
One ultimate aim is to investigate the potential role of ferroptosis in vivo. Therefore, a potent and specific drug-like small molecule inhibitor of this process was identified. As set forth above, to overcome the inherent limitations of many individual small molecule collections (Macarron et al., 2011), a custom screening library of 9,517 small molecules derived from a starting pool of 3,372,615 commercially available compounds that were filtered in silico on the basis of drug-likeness, solubility, scaffold diversity and other parameters was assembled. Screening of this ‘lead-optimized compound’ (LOC) library and subsequent confirmation studies identified a compound, which the inventors named ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), as the most potent inhibitor of erastin-induced ferroptosis in HT-1080 cells (EC50=60 nM) ( FIGS. 4A, 10A, and 10B ). To the inventors' knowledge, the activity for Fer-1 has not previously been reported in any biological system. A total synthesis of Fer-1 was performed as set forth above, and this material was used to confirm the activity of Fer-1 and to demonstrate that it specifically inhibited RSL-induced death, but not cell death induced by other oxidative lethal compounds and apoptosis-inducing agents ( FIGS. 4B, 6A ).
The Fer-1 mechanism of action was examined. Fer-1 did not inhibit ERK phosphorylation or arrest the proliferation of HT-1080 cells, suggesting that it does not inhibit the MEK/ERK pathway, chelate iron or inhibit protein synthesis ( FIGS. 4C and 4D ). Fer-1 did, however, prevent erastin-induced accumulation of cytosolic and lipid ROS ( FIG. 4E ). Moreover, similar to the positive control antioxidant trolox, Fer-1 readily oxidized the stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) under cell free conditions, a test of intrinsic antioxidant potential ( FIG. 4F ). Substitution of the primary aromatic amine for a nitro group (SRS8-24), or elimination of the N-cyclohexyl moiety (CA-1), destroyed the antioxidant capability of Fer-1, as well as its ability to prevent erastin (10 μM)-induced death in HT-1080 cells ( FIGS. 4F-H ). Thus, both aromatic amines are required for Fer-1 to prevent RSL-induced death, a function plausibly linked to its ability to scavenge free radicals.
The results suggested that lipid ROS were crucial for erastin-induced death. The inventors therefore hypothesized that Fer-1 was a lipid ROS scavenger, with the N-cyclohexyl moiety serving as a lipophilic anchor within biological membranes. Consistent with this hypothesis, in a series of ten Fer-1 analogs, where the number of carbons in the N-substituted cyclic moiety was systematically varied, a significant correlation between the predicted lipophilicity (octanol-water partition coefficient, log P) and the erastin-death-suppressing ability of each molecule (Spearman R=−0.85, P=0.002) was observed ( FIGS. 4I and 11C ). Of note, SRS8-72, a Fer-1 analog with N-cyclopropyl in place of N-cyclohexyl, which was an order of magnitude less potent than Fer-1 at preventing death, nonetheless retained equivalent intrinsic antioxidant capability in the cell-free DPPH assay ( FIGS. 4F-H and 10C). Thus, the N-cyclohexyl moiety likely enables Fer-1 to prevent ferroptosis by promoting the tethering of Fer-1 within lipid membranes, as opposed to influencing the intrinsic antioxidant potential of this molecule.
Intriguingly, lipid partitioning alone does not appear to be sufficient to account for the potency of Fer-1. Fer-1 has similar predicted lipophilicity, but much greater erastin-suppressing potency than two canonical lipophilic antioxidants (trolox and butylated hydroxyltoluene [BHT]), while being both considerably more lipophilic and more potent than two representative soluble antioxidants (Tiron, TEMPO) ( FIGS. 4J and 4K ). Both trolox and BHT are phenolic antioxidants, while Fer-1 contains an aromatic amine. It was hypothesized that this difference may confer a unique profile of radical reactivity upon Fer-1 that is better tuned to the RSL mechanism.
Example 7
Fer-1 Prevents Glutamate-Induced Neurotoxicity
Excitotoxic cell death that occurs in the nervous system in epilepsy, stroke and other trauma situations has also been described as an oxidative, iron-dependent process (Cheah et al., 2006; Choi, 1988; Murphy et al., 1989). It was hypothesized that excitotoxic death could be related to erastin-induced ferroptosis. This hypothesis was tested using a rat organotypic hippocampal slice culture (OHSC) model that closely resembles the hippocampus in vivo by preserving the integrity of neuronal connections, both inhibitory and excitatory, and their supporting cells, including astrocytes and microglia (Lossi et al., 2009). OHSCs have proven to be ideal complex preparations for lead-compound identification and validation (Noraberg et al., 2005; Sundstrom et al., 2005), capable of predicting in vivo efficacy (Cater et al., 2007; Morrison et al., 2002).
OHSCs were treated with a lethal excitotoxic stimulus (5 mM L-glutamate, 3 hours) that mimics the consequences of stroke and neurodegenerative disease (Morrison et al., 2002; Sundstrom et al., 2005) ( FIG. 5A ). These slices were co-incubated with glutamate and vehicle alone or with glutamate plus Fer-1 (2 μM), the iron chelator CPX (5 μM) or, as a positive control, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (10 μM). The effects of these compound treatments on propidium iodide (PI) uptake were analyzed, as an indicator of cell death, 24 hours following the end of glutamate treatment, in 3 defined regions of the OHSCs: the dentate gyrus (DG), the CA1 and the CA3 fields of the hippocampus. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) suggested significant differences for both brain region (F2,75=19.23, P<0.0001) and compound treatment (F4,75=67.8, P<0.0001) factors. Focusing on the compound treatment effect, Bonferroni post-tests indicated that glutamate induced significant cell death in all three regions of the brain, and that this death was attenuated significantly and to an almost identical extent by co-treatment with Fer-1, CPX or MK-801 (P<0.001 for all interactions except glutamate+MK-801 within the DG, P<0.01) ( FIG. 5B-E ). These results suggest that glutamate-induced death in OHSCs and erastin-induced death in cancer cells share in common a core lethal mechanism that can be inhibited by iron chelation or Fer-1.
Example 8
Erastin Inhibits System xc−
CPX and Fer-1 suppressed erastin-induced death in cancer cells and glutamate-induced toxicity in OHSCs, consistent with a common iron- and ROS-dependent death execution mechanism. Whether any death-initiating mechanisms could also be shared between these two processes was investigated.
Glutamate-induced death in brain cells can be initiated by calcium influx through ionotropic glutamate receptors and through competitive inhibition of cystine uptake by the Na+-independent cystine/glutamate antiporter, system xc− (Choi, 1988; Murphy et al., 1989). The calcium chelators BAPTA-AM, Fura-2 and EGTA had no effect on erastin-induced death ( FIG. 12A ) (Wolpaw et al., 2011), arguing against a role for Ca2+ influx in this process. However, striking clustering of erastin and sulfasalazine (SAS), a specific inhibitor of system xc− (Gout et al., 2001), was observed in a modulatory profile of 19 oxidative and non-oxidative lethal molecules generated in HT-1080 cells ( FIG. 6A ). If blockade of system xc−-mediated cystine import can trigger ferroptosis, then providing this metabolite to cells through an alternative means should rescue from death. Indeed, β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), which can circumvent the inhibition of system xc− by promoting cystine uptake through an alternative pathway (Ishii et al., 1981), strongly inhibited cell death in HT-1080 cells induced by erastin, SAS and glutamate ( FIGS. 6A and 12B ). As predicted by these results, SAS, like erastin, behaved as an oncogenic RAS-selective lethal (RSL) compound, albeit with considerably lower potency than erastin ( FIG. 12C ). This is nonetheless noteworthy, as SAS is an FDA-approved drug not previously shown to demonstrate such activity.
System xc− is a disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of SLC7A11 (xCT) and SLC3A2 (4F2hc, CD98hc) (Sato et al., 1999) ( FIG. 6B ). Inhibition of system xc− can lead to a compensatory transcriptional up-regulation of SLC7A11 (Lo et al., 2008). Consistent with this, substantial upregulation of SLC7A11 in HT-1080 cells treated with erastin or SAS was observed. This effect was suppressed by β-ME, but not DFO or Fer-1 ( FIG. 6C ). Further confirming the relevance of system xc− to erastin-induced ferroptosis, siRNA-mediated silencing of SLC7A11 with two independent siRNAs sensitized HT-1080 cells to erastin-induced death ( FIGS. 6D and 6E ), while transfection of HT-1080 cells with a plasmid encoding DDK-tagged SLC7A11 conferred protection from erastin- and SAS-induced death ( FIG. 12D ). Given these results, the uptake of [14C]cystine in HT-1080 cells was directly examined. Erastin (10 μM), glutamate (50 mM) and SAS (1 mM) abolished the Na+-independent uptake of [14C]cystine while RSL3 had no effect on this process ( FIGS. 6F, 12E ).
How erastin inhibits system xc− was investigated. Analysis of affinity purification data (Yagoda et al., 2007) identified SLC7A5 (LAT1, 4F2lc, CD98lc) as the lone protein bound by an active erastin affinity analog in lysates from both HRAS-wildtype BJeH and HRAS-mutant BJeLR cells ( FIG. 6G ). SLC7A5 (like SLC7A11) is one of six light chains that bind SLC3A2 to form amino acid transporters of differing substrate selectivity. The SLC7A5/SLC3A2 complex (system L) transports large, neutral amino acids (Kanai and Endou, 2003) ( FIG. 6B ). In a profile of 123 metabolites from human Jurkat T lymphocytes treated with erastin (1 μM, 25 min) (Ramanathan and Schreiber, 2009), highly significant decreases were observed in the levels of system L substrates (Kanai and Endou, 2003), while the levels of non-system L substrates were unchanged or increased ( FIG. 6H ). However, unlike inhibition of system xc− using excess glutamate (12.5 mM), inhibition of system L using excess D-phenylalanine (12.5 mM) (Kanai and Endou, 2003) did not strongly sensitize to erastin ( FIG. 6I ). Together, these results suggest that erastin inhibits system L-mediated amino acid uptake, but that this does not contribute directly to ferroptosis. Rather, erastin binding to SLC7A5 or the SLC7A5/SLC3A2 complex interferes with cystine uptake by the SLC3A2/SLC7A11 complex in trans.
Example 9
NAPDH Oxidases Provide One Source of Death-Inducing Ros in Erastin-Treated Cells
Blocking system xc− inhibits cysteine-dependent glutathione (GSH) synthesis and inhibits the trans-plasma membrane cysteine redox shuttle (Banjac et al., 2008; Ishii et al., 1981). Both effects impair cellular antioxidant defenses, thereby facilitating toxic ROS accumulation. Having ruled out the mitochondrial ETC as a source of death-inducing ROS in erastin-treated cells ( FIGS. 1D-F ), the role of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family of superoxide-producing enzymes (NOX1-5, DUOX1,2), which are up-regulated in several RAS-mutant tumors (Kamata, 2009) was examined. Erastin-induced ferroptosis was strongly suppressed in Calu-1 cells by the canonical NOX inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI), the NOX1/4 specific inhibitor GKT137831 (Laleu et al., 2010) and an inhibitor of the NADPH-generating pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), 6-aminonicotinamde (6-AN) ( FIGS. 7A and 7B ). Given that Calu-1 cells express NOX1 at much higher levels than NOX4 ( FIG. 13A ), NOX1 is the most likely candidate to mediate the observed NOX-dependent lethal effects in these cells. Additionally, shRNA-mediated silencing of two PPP enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGD), also prevented erastin-induced ferroptosis in Calu-1 cells to the same extent as silencing of VDAC2 ( FIGS. 7C and 7D ). 6-AN also prevented cell death as well as ROS production in BJeLR cells ( FIGS. 13B and 13C ), suggesting an important role for this pathway is these cell types. On the other hand, NOX and PPP inhibitors were only partially effective at preventing erastin-induced ferroptosis in HT-1080 cells ( FIG. 7B ), indicating that other pathways, in addition to the PPP/NOX pathway, can contribute to the onset of death in erastin-treated cells, once the appropriate conditions have been set by the inhibition of system xc−.
Ferroptotic death is morphologically, biochemically and genetically distinct from apoptosis, various forms of necrosis, and autophagy. This process is characterized by the overwhelming, iron-dependent accumulation of lethal lipid ROS ( FIG. 7E , blue outline). Unlike other forms of apoptotic and non-apoptotic death (Christofferson and Yuan, 2010; Jacobson and Raff, 1995), this requirement for ROS accumulation appears to be universal. In at least some cells, NOX-family enzymes make important contributions to this process. Indeed, although the possibility of a death-inducing protein or protein complex activated downstream of ROS accumulation cannot be excluded, the inventors posit that the executioners of death in cancer cells undergoing ferroptosis are these ROS themselves. An important prediction of this model is that under anoxic conditions ferroptosis will be inactive. However, even here, agents such as erastin that prevent uptake of essential amino acids by system L are likely to be toxic to cells.
Using an shRNA library targeting most known genes encoding mitochondrial proteins (Pagliarini et al., 2008), specific roles for RPL8, IREB2, ATP5G3, TTC35, CS and ACSF2 in erastin-induced ferroptosis were identified. A plausible new hypothesis to emerge from these data is that CS and ACSF2 are required to synthesize a specific lipid precursor necessary for death ( FIG. 7E ). Just as important, the high-resolution of the arrayed approach (1 hairpin/well, minimum 5 hairpins/gene) provides confidence that the various mitochondrial genes not identified in the screen, including many implicated in apoptotic and non-apoptotic death (BID, BAK1, BAX, AIFM1, PP/F, HTRA2, ENDOG, PGAM5), are truly not required for erastin-induced ferroptosis. This screening collection will be a valuable resource for future studies of the role of the mitochondria in cell physiology.
In cancer cells, inhibition of system xc−-mediated cystine uptake by erastin, SAS or glutamate may be sufficient to initiate iron-dependent ferroptosis. Inhibition of system xc− is, however, not necessary: RSL3 does not inhibit cystine uptake and yet triggers an otherwise similar iron and ROS-dependent ferroptototic death program. Thus, RSL3 likely modulates the activity of a target lying downstream of or in parallel to system xc− ( FIG. 7E ). Importantly, this may enable RSL3 to activate ferroptosis in cells or conditions where cystine uptake via system xc− is not limiting for survival. Lanperisone, another recently identified oncogenic RAS-selective lethal small molecule that causes non-apoptotic, iron-dependent death in mouse Kras-mutant tumor cells (Shaw et al., 2011), may also inhibit the function of system xc− or another target in the ferroptotic pathway. Other compounds that behave as RSLs, such as PEITC, oncrasin and piperlongumine (Guo et al., 2008; Raj et al., 2011; Trachootham et al., 2006), trigger mitochondrial cytochrome C release, caspase activation and other features of apoptosis not observed in cancer cells undergoing ferroptosis. Certain tumor cells are highly resistant to apoptosis (Ni Chonghaile et al., 2011). Thus, agents such as erastin, RSL3 and lanperisone that can trigger non-apoptotic death may exhibit a unique spectrum of clinical activity.
In some brain cell populations, inhibition of system xc− by glutamate triggers oxidative cell death dependent on iron and lipid ROS, but also Ca2+ influx, mitochondrial damage, mitochondrial ROS production and chromatin fragmentation (Li et al., 1997; Murphy et al., 1989; Ratan et al., 1994; Tan et al., 1998; Yonezawa et al., 1996). These latter events are not required for RSL-induced ferroptosis in cancer cells, perhaps because heightened activity of NOX or other pro-oxidant enzymes, or basically altered membrane lipid composition, is sufficient to promote death in the absence of these additional features. Regardless, the oxidative death pathways triggered in cancer cells and brain cells by blockade of cystine uptake both appear to access a core iron- and ROS-dependent ferroptotic mechanism, accounting for the ability of Fer-1 and CPX to attenuate death in both cases ( FIG. 7E ).
The specific role of iron in ferroptosis remains unclear. Ferroptosis cannot be explained by a simple increase in H2O2-dependent, iron-catalyzed ROS production (i.e. Fenton chemistry), as H2O2-induced death is distinct from RSL-induced ferroptosis ( FIGS. 1 and 2 ). Rather, the results are most consistent with one or more iron-dependent enzymes functioning as part of the core, oxidative lethal mechanism. The void created in the antioxidant defenses of the cell by the inhibition of cystine uptake by erastin may be required to unleash the activity of these enzymes. Thus, for better or worse, the aberrantly elevated levels of iron observed in some cancer cells (Pinnix et al., 2010) and pathological neuronal populations (Duce et al., 2010; Lei et al., 2012) may predispose to ferroptotic death in situations of cystine or cysteine limitation.
