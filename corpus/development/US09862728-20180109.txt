The hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the hepacivirus genera within the Flaviviridae family, is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide (Boyer, N. et al. J Hepatol. 2000, 32, 98-112). Consequently, a significant focus of current antiviral research is directed toward the development of improved methods for the treatment of chronic HCV infections in humans (Ciesek, S., von Hahn T., and Manns, M P., Clin. Liver Dis., 2011, 15, 597-609; Soriano, V. et al, J. Antimicrob. Chemother., 2011, 66, 1573-1686; Brody, H., Nature Outlook, 2011, 474, S1-S7; Gordon, C. P., et al., J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 1-20; Maradpour, D., et al., Nat. Rev. Micro. 2007, 5, 453-463).

Definitions
As used in the present specification, the following words and phrases are generally intended to have the meanings as set forth below, except to the extent that the context in which they are used indicates otherwise.
The term “solvate” refers to a complex formed by the combining of Compound I and a solvent.
The term “desolvated” refers to a Compound I form that is a solvate as described herein, and from which solvent molecules have been partially or completely removed. Desolvation techniques to produce desolvated forms include, without limitation, exposure of a Compound I form (solvate) to a vacuum, subjecting the solvate to elevated temperature, exposing the solvate to a stream of gas, such as air or nitrogen, or any combination thereof. Thus, a desolvated Compound I form can be anhydrous, i.e., completely without solvent molecules, or partially solvated wherein solvent molecules are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts.
The term “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount that is sufficient to effect treatment, as defined below, when administered to a mammal in need of such treatment. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending upon the subject being treated, the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.
The term “about” refers to a range of ±10%, unless otherwise specified.
The term “co-crystal” refers to a crystalline material formed by combining a compound of Formula I, or any Formula disclosed herein and one or more co-crystal formers (i.e., a molecule, ion or atom). In certain instances, co-crystals may have improved properties as compared to the parent form (i.e., the free molecule, zwitterion, etc.) or a salt of the parent compound. Improved properties can be increased solubility, increased dissolution, increased bioavailability, increased dose response, decreased hygroscopicity, a crystalline form of a normally amorphous compound, a crystalline form of a difficult to salt or unsaltable compound, decreased form diversity, more desired morphology, and the like. Methods for making and characterizing co-crystals are known to those of skill in the art.
Salts of the compounds disclosed herein can be base addition salts or acid addition salts depending on the reactivity of the functional groups present on the specific compound. Base addition salts can be derived from inorganic or organic bases.

It is understood that in all substituted groups defined above, polymers arrived at by defining substituents with further substituents to themselves (e.g., substituted aryl having a substituted aryl group as a substituent which is itself substituted with a substituted aryl group, etc.) are not intended for inclusion herein. Also not included are infinite numbers of substituents, whether the substituents are the same or different. In such cases, the maximum number of such substituents is three. Each of the above definitions is thus constrained by a limitation that, for example, substituted aryl groups are limited to -substituted aryl-(substituted aryl)-substituted aryl.

Pharmaceutical Formulations
The Compound I forms of this disclosure are formulated with conventional carriers and excipients, which will be selected in accord with ordinary practice. Tablets will contain excipients, glidants, fillers, binders and the like. Aqueous formulations are prepared in sterile form, and when intended for delivery by other than oral administration generally will be isotonic. All formulations will optionally contain excipients such as, for example, those set forth in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (1986). Excipients include ascorbic acid and other antioxidants, chelating agents such as, for example, EDTA, carbohydrates such as, for example, dextrin, hydroxyalkylcellulose, hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose, stearic acid and the like. The pH of the formulations ranges from about 3 to about 11, but is ordinarily about 7 to 10. It is contemplated that the Compound I form may be administered once, twice or three times a day.
While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone it may be preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use, of the disclosure comprise at least one active ingredient, as above defined, together with one or more acceptable carriers therefore and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and physiologically innocuous to the recipient thereof.
The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.
Formulations of the present disclosure suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as, for example, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.
A tablet is made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as, for example, a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, or preservative. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom.
For administration to the eye or other external tissues e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w/w (including active ingredient(s) in a range between 0.1% and 20% in increments of 0.1% w/w such as, for example, 0.6% w/w, 0.7% w/w, etc.), preferably 0.2 to 15% w/w and most preferably 0.5 to 10% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.
If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as, for example, propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a Compound I form which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulphoxide and related analogs.
The oily phase of the emulsions of this disclosure may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.
Emulgents and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the disclosure include Tween® 60, Span® 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.
The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties. The cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as, for example, di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as, for example, white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils are used.
Pharmaceutical formulations according to the present disclosure comprise one or more Compound I forms of the disclosure together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients and optionally other therapeutic agents. Pharmaceutical formulations containing the active ingredient may be in any form suitable for the intended method of administration. When used for oral use for example, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as, for example, calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, povidone, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as, for example, maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as, for example, cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as, for example, glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.
Formulations for oral use may be also presented as hard gelatin capsules where the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, such as, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.
Aqueous suspensions of the disclosure contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcelluose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as, for example, a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as, for example, ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as, for example, sucrose or saccharin.
Oil suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, such as, for example, arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as, for example, liquid paraffin. The oral suspensions may contain a thickening agent, such as, for example, beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents, such as, for example, those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as, for example, ascorbic acid.
Granules of the disclosure suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent, and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those disclosed above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.

Synthesis of Intermediates for Compound of Formula I
A. Synthesis of Methyl (2S,3S,4R)-3-ethyl-4-hydroxypyrrolidine-2-carboxylate Tosylate Salt (II)
The order of reduction of the double bond and ketone was reversed so new intermediates were formed. B (R=tBu) and C (R=tBu). The t-butyl ester was used to make D in U.S. Publication No. 2014-0017198; however, it was converted directly to the methyl ester tosylate salt without chromatography and crystallized to remove diastereomeric impurities. A single crystal X-Ray of the tosylate salt II was obtained.
Step 1: Synthesis of A
I. Enamine Formation to A
DMF-DMA (125.3 g, 2.0 eq.) and DCM (300 mL) were charged to a reactor under N2 and heated to 45° C. In a separate container the commercially available starting material (150 g) was dissolved in DCM (300 mL) under N2. This solution was charged to the reactor containing the DMF-DMA solution over 3 hours. Upon reaction completion, the solution was cooled to room temperature. 5% LiCl (750 mL) was added to the reactor and the mixture was stirred. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was removed. Water (750 mL) was added to the reactor and the mixture was stirred. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was removed. The organic layer was dried with Na2SO4 and the mixture was polish filtered.
The filtrate was concentrated to ˜200 mL and heptane (600 mL) was charged to obtain a murky solution. The mixture was further concentrated to remove residual DCM. Additional heptane (600 mL) was added and the mixture was heated to about 50-60° C. and aged for about 1 h to obtain a slurry. The slurry was cooled to about 15° C. over about 4 hours before aging at about 15° C. overnight (˜18 h). Intermediate A (R=tBu) was isolated via vacuum filtration and rinsed with 2 volumes heptane. The resulting solid was dried in a vacuum oven at about 45° C. to constant weight to obtain 141.8 g of A (R=tBu). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) (mixture of E/Z isomer): δ 7.4 (s, 1H), 5.2-5.3 (s, 1H), 3.8 (d, 2H) 3.2 (broad s, 6H), 1.5 (s, 9H), 1.4 (s, 9H). UPLC/MS M+1=341 amu.
Step 2: Synthesis of B (R=tBu)
I. Methylation of A (R=tBu) to B (R=tBu
To a reaction vessel was added A (151 g, 0.44 mol, 1.0 equiv). The vessel was evacuated, purged with nitrogen, and the substrate was dissolved in MeTHF (450 mL, 3 vol). The reaction mixture was cooled to an internal temperature of about −12° C. and treated dropwise with methylmagnesium bromide (155 mL of a 3.0 M solution in diethyl ether, 0.55 mol, 1.25 equiv) over about 1 h. Upon reaction completion (about 2 h), a reverse quench was performed by adding the reaction to cold saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (400 mL). If an emulsion was observed, more aqueous ammonium chloride or 2 M HCl was added. The aqueous layer was extracted with toluene (1×200 mL). The organic layers were combined, washed with 1 M HCl (150 mL), then brine (150 mL), and concentrated in vacuo to provide B. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 6.90-6.92 (1H, m), 5.08-5.16 (1H, m), 3.94-4.00 (2H, m), 2.02-2.04 (3H, m), 1.44-1.49 (18H, m).

Enone B (R=tBu) (32.0 g, 0.10 mol) was dissolved in toluene (3 vol) under an atmosphere of N2. Pd/C was subsequently added (1.1 g, 0.5 mol %) and the reaction was flushed with N2, followed by H2, and stirred vigorously at room temperature under 1 atm of H2. After completion of the reaction, diatomaceous earth (0.1 S, 13.2 g) was added and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes. The heterogeneous mixture was filtered through diatomaceous earth and rinsed with additional toluene (0.5-1 vol) and concentrated to dryness to provide C as a pale yellow solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD): δ 4.68 (dd, J=36.9, 9.3 Hz, 1H), 3.99-3.75 (m, 2H), 2.63 (tdd, J=13.7, 9.2, 4.6 Hz, 1H), 1.89 (dt, J=13.8, 6.7 Hz, 1H), 1.46 (s, 9H), 1.43 (s, 9H), 1.30-1.16 (m, 1H), 1.07 (t, J=7.4 Hz, 3H). Epi-C has a characteristic peak at 4.23 ppm in MeOD (d, J=3.5 Hz, 1H) which can be used to calculate the diastereoselectivity of the hydrogenation. The diastereoselectivity was determined by NMR to be typically >50:1.
Step 4: Synthesis of D (R=tBu)
I. Reduction of C (R=tBu) to provide D (R=tBu)
ZnCl2 (27.3 g, 200 mmol, 2 equiv) and CPME (7 vol relative to C, 220 mL) were combined and the heterogeneous mixture was warmed to an internal temperature of about 95° C. and stirred for about 1.5 hours at that temperature. The resulting slurry was cooled to about 25° C. NaBH4 (7.56 g, 200 mmol, 2 equiv) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight (˜18 hrs).
The slurry was cooled to about 0° C., and the solution of C (R=tBu) (˜100 mmol) in toluene (3 total vol) was added slowly while maintaining the temperature to about below +3° C. After addition, the mixture was stirred at about 0° C. until complete consumption of the starting material. The reaction was quenched by reverse addition into a solution of citric acid (2.5 equiv, 48 g) in ice water (200 mL). The layers were separated and the organic layer was washed with brine (60 mL, 2 vol), dried over MgSO4 (0.05 S, 1.5 g), and polish filtered. The crude organic solution was concentrated to a thick oil, diluted with 2 volumes of hexanes and filtered through 2S silica gel, eluting with 1:1 acetone:hexanes.

Synthesis of Compound of Formula II (R═CH3)
Deprotection and Transesterification of D (R=tBu) to II (R═CH3)
D=(R=tBu) (5.55 g, 17.6 mmol) was charged to a reactor and dissolved in methanol (55.5 mL). p-Toluenesulfonic acid (10.7 g, 3.2 eq.) was charged to the solution and the mixture is stirred for about 1 hour at room temperature. The mixture was then heated to about 60° C. The reaction was stirred until reaction completion. The reaction mixture was concentrated to about 4 volumes and cooled to about 45° C. MTBE (4 volumes) were added slowly to achieve a cloudy solution. II seed (0.05%) was charged to the solution to and the mixture was aged for about 30 minutes to obtain a thin slurry. Additional MTBE (5 volumes) were charged over about 90 minutes and the resulting slurry was stirred overnight.

The resulting wet cake was dried under vacuum at about 40° C. to obtain compound II (R═CH3) as a tosylate salt. 1H NMR (400 MHz, MeOD) δ 7.7 (d, 2H), 7.2 (d, 2H), 4.7 (d, 1H), 4.3 (m, 1H), 3.8 (s, 3H), 3.6 (m, 1H), 3.2 (m, 1H), 2.4 (m, 1H), 2.3 (s, 3H), 1.3 (m, 2H), 1.0 (t, 3H). LC/MS M+1=174.1
B. Synthesis of 3-Chloro-2-(1,1-difluorobut-3-en-1-yl)-6-methoxyquinoxaline (IV)
Compound IV contains one more methylene group than the analog used in U.S. Publication No. 2014-0017198 and so requires a different starting material. Ethyl trifluoropyruvate was converted to intermediate G in three steps. Intermediate G was telescoped through to a 4:1 regioisomeric mixture of J and K. In the U.S. Publication No. 2014-0017198, a nitro, amino-anisole was used for the ring formation in a two-step process of reacting the amine first and then reducing the nitro group to allow cyclization. Two regioisomers were formed. In this route, the starting material was instead the diamino analog and similar mixture was obtained.

Compound of formula VII contains one less methylene than the material used in the medicinal chemistry route in order to shift the ring-closing metathesis reaction away from the difluorinated methylene on the quinoxaline fragment. A similar Kulinkovich cyclopropanation, acylation and enzymatic resolution was used with this homolog. The cyclopropanol and then cyclopropyl acetate were distilled but it was not necessary to do so. Acid-base extractions were used to remove still acetylated material. The final product was isolated as a S-1-phenylethanamine salt which improved the diastereomeric and overall purity of the product. Recrystallization may be used to further improve the purity of the product. Other salts may be possible.

The existing process route shown above was disclosed is in the U.S. Publication No. 2014-0017198. The route shown below proceeds through a common known intermediate V-v. Racemic A-b was selectively hydrolyzed to racemic A-c with an approximate 10:1 ratio of cis/trans diastereomers. This mono acid is subjected to a classical resolution with a chiral amine to form chiral A-c as a salt. A recrystallization can be performed to enhance enantiomeric excess. The carboxylic acid was next converted to the amide A-d and isolated. In telescoping steps, the amide was subjected to a Hoffman rearrangement, hydrolysis to the amine, protection of the amine with Boc and hydrolysis of the methyl ester to form the desired amino acid, V-v. V-v was then converted to XII as shown in the above scheme.
