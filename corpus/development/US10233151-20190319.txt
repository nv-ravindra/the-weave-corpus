The present invention relates to a novel compound, 3-aryl-4-catechol-N-1H-pyrrole and the derivatives thereof, and to the method for preparing same, the pharmaceutical compositions containing same and the use of same as a drug, particularly to treat cancer and diseases associated with excessive angiogenesis.
PRIOR ART
Tumor development integrates at least three principal biological phenomena:
1. uncontrolled multiplication of tumor cells associated with inhibition of apoptosis and activation of survival and proliferation pathways,
2. abnormal peritumoral angiogenesis,
3. presence of a hypoxic region in the center of the tumor, at a distance from blood vessels, leading to phenotypical changes in the cancer cells, often the origin of mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance.
Current anticancer treatments which target the first phenomenon block the uncontrolled multiplication of cancer cells, either by inhibition of antiapoptotic factors or inhibition of cell division or the survival process. Although these treatments, which are often part of a multitherapeutic approach, provide a real benefit in cancer treatment, they are not sufficient to eradicate all the cancer cells because they target only part of the mechanisms that contribute to tumor growth. To this disadvantage is added the problem of target specificity, compared to normal cells, as well as mechanisms of resistance.
Recent research has established a new therapeutic approach whose objective is inhibition of the peritumoral angiogenesis process. Indeed, angiogenesis is essential to tumor growth in both normoxia and hypoxia. It is promoted by the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by tumor cells, and amplified by the hypoxic state due to synthesis of the transcription factor HIFα. Most of the antiangiogenic drugs used correspond either to antibodies directed against VEGF or to compounds directed against the VEGF receptor. Unfortunately, the clinical results of antiangiogenic therapies are very modest and are often associated with mechanisms of resistance and an increased risk of invasion and metastasis. Indeed, peritumoral vessels are structurally and functionally abnormal, which will lead to an opposite adaptive response, aggravating the vascular anomaly, and to adaptation of the tumor cells to these conditions of increased hypoxia (Nature Reviews-Cancer; 10, 417-427, 2011). Clinical studies are ongoing to follow the antitumor effect of certain vascular-disrupting agents (VDA) based on these structural differences between normal and tumor vascularization. However, a certain prudence is imperative due to potential cardiovascular effects. It thus appears necessary to develop new antiangiogenic or antivascular compounds to treat peritumoral angiogenesis but also diseases associated with excessive abnormal angiogenesis, like age-related macular degeneration (ARMD).
The third component of tumor growth is associated with decreased partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) in the center of the tumor leading to a state of intratumoral hypoxia, mentioned above. This state of hypoxia is characterized by metabolic and genetic cellular modifications leading to the activation of signaling pathways linked to survival and to activation of tumor angiogenesis. These modifications are partly the cause of phenomena of resistance to current chemotherapies. The drugs currently developed to eliminate cancer cells in hypoxia are divided into two groups: first, prodrugs bioreducible by one- or two-electron enzyme systems and second, drugs targeting factors overexpressed in the cellular response to the hypoxic state (HIFα, UPR, thioredoxin), allowing the survival of hypoxic cancer cells (Nature Reviews-Cancer, 11, 393-410, 2011). The bioreducible prodrugs of the first category are chiefly quinones (α 1-4) (apaziquone, RH1) or nitro compounds (TH-302, PR-104), acting on DNA. The major side effect of compounds of the first category shown during phase I and II clinical trials results from their toxicity and their limited extravascular penetration, effects which are even more marked as the distance of the hypoxic cells from the blood vessels increases. Other drugs which act on the thioredoxin pathway (PX12, motexafin gadolinium) and the transcription factor HIFα pathway (PX-478, PX12) are undergoing clinical evaluation.
To date, every drug used in cancer chemotherapy thus targets only one biological phenomenon at a time, and treatment specificity remains poor. It thus appears important to find new, more specific antitumor compounds acting simultaneously on the three components of tumor development.
The inventors of the present invention have discovered a novel class of compounds which respond to this need.
To that end, the inventors analyzed data concerning the biological, biochemical and genetic characteristics of cancer cells in normoxia and hypoxia, in order to find a common molecular denominator modified by cancer cells and by endothelial cells associated with abnormal peritumoral angiogenesis.
The inventors thus discovered that the analysis of all these data shows that cancer cells, in normoxia and in hypoxia, are characterized inter alia by intense production of superoxide anion, caused by strong NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity (Nature Reviews-Drug Discovery, 8, 579-591, 2009; Nature Reviews-Cancer, 12, 627-637, 2012). This superoxide anion overproduction is associated with general “redox” dysregulation, associated with low enzymatic activity (catalase, peroxiredoxin, glutathione peroxidase) degrading H2O2 and with strong activation of the thioredoxin (TRX)-thioredoxin reductase (TRX-R) system, controlling inter alia the redox state of the peroxiredoxins and the activity of HIFα. Cancer cells are thus highly dependent on “reactive oxygen species” (O2∘−/H2O2) for their survival. This oxidative stress is regarded as an “Achilles' heel” of cancer cells. Superoxide anion overproduction is also found in active endothelial cells, in the proliferative phase, caused by high NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity during angiogenesis. The major isoform in endothelial cells is NOX2, regulated by VEGF, via the c-Src and Akt pathway, during the proliferative phase. Moreover, the inventors also discovered that in the context of a search for side effect-free anticancer prodrugs, this common molecular entity could also intervene in the activation of a prodrug to form an active drug able to act on the three tumor components, and on diseases associated with excessive angiogenesis.
Superoxide anion thus seems to be a common denominator in cancer cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, as well as in endothelial cells. Moreover, it can fulfill the role of an oxidative activator of prodrugs. The inventors thus selected as the criterion the overproduction of superoxide anion (O2∘−) by tumor and endothelial cells, to search for a novel compound (prodrug) specifically activatable by O2∘−. Screening of the ICSN chemical library made it possible to select a compound whose anticancer and antiangiogenic activities are expressed as:
inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, with no effect on physiological angiogenesis; inhibition of “de novo” growth of vascular tubes, cytotoxicity against endothelial cells only in the growth phase;
cytotoxicity against cancer cells in normoxia, only in the presence of O2∘−;
cytotoxicity against cancer cells in hypoxia, only in the presence of O2∘−.
To determine the structure of the active product obtained after reaction of the prodrug with superoxide anion, the novel compound was exposed in vitro to superoxide anion. It forms by oxidative coupling a dimeric compound containing a quinone moiety, the anticancer activity of which appears as cytotoxicity against cancer cells in normoxia and in hypoxia.

Reactivity of Compound (1) with Superoxide Anion In Vitro; Study by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) in the Presence of BMPO. Determination of IC50
The reactivity of compound (1) with superoxide anion in the organic phase was studied by EPR at room temperature using a competition method with the superoxide trapping reagent BMPO (5-tent-butoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) ( FIG. 1A ). The superoxide anion source is potassium salt (KO2) used at 5 mM in DMSO after ultrasound-assisted dissolution. The concentrations used for compound (1) are between 0.31 and 40 μM. The trapping reagent BMPO is used at a final concentration of 25 mM. These experiments were carried out with a MiniScope MS 100 EPR spectrometer (Magnettech GmbH, Germany), operating at a frequency of 9.5 GHz (X-band) with the following parameters: magnetic field: 336.0±9.9 mT; sweep time: 20 s; sampling: 4096 points; modulation amplitude: 0.10 mT; modulation frequency: 100 kHz; gain: 900; microwave power: 100 mW. The inhibition of the formation of the BMPO superoxide adduct, expressed as a decrease in the intensity of the EPR spectrum of this species, is dependent on the amount of compound (1) applied and produces a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.5 μM.
The reactivity of compound (1) with superoxide anion in the aqueous phase was also studied by EPR at room temperature using the same competition method with the trapping reagent BMPO at 50 mM ( FIG. 1B ). In this case, superoxide anion is produced by enzymatic reaction of xanthine oxidase (XO, 53 mU/mL) with xanthine (X, 250 μM) in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The concentrations used for compound (1) are between 0.34 μM and 43.1 μM. These experiments were carried out with an ELEXSYS E500 EPR spectrometer (Bruker, Wissembourg, France), operating at a frequency of 9.82 GHz (X-band) with the following parameters: magnetic field: 349.0 ±6.6 mT; sweep time: 41.94 s; sampling: 1024 points; time constant: 40.96 ms; conversion time: 40.96 ms; modulation amplitude: 0.10 mT; modulation frequency: 100 kHz; gain: 60 dB; microwave power: 10 mW. The inhibition of the formation of the BMPO superoxide adduct, expressed as a decrease in the intensity of the EPR spectrum of this species after 10 minutes of incubation, depends on the concentration of compound (1) used; an IC50 of 3.2 μM is measured.
A direct reaction between compound (1) and the BMPO superoxide adduct was excluded by confirming that the stability of the BMPO adduct, formed by preincubation with the X/XO system, is not modified in the presence of compound (1) (result not shown).
Example 3
Reactivity of Compound (1) with superoxide Anion In Vitro: Study by Paramagnetic Resonance Electronic (EPR) of the Disappearance of the O2∘− Signal in the Presence of Compound (1), and Demonstration of the Formation of a Radical Intermediate
In order to follow the direct interaction of compound (1) with superoxide anion, solid potassium superoxide (KO2) was dissolved by sonication in DMSO (final concentration 2.5 mM), then mixed with compound (1) and immediately cooled by immersion in liquid nitrogen. EPR analysis at 77 K (liquid nitrogen) was carried out with a MiniScope MS 100 EPR spectrometer, operating at a frequency of 9.5 GHz (X-band) with the following parameters: magnetic field: 336.0±49.8 mT; sweep time: 20 s; sampling: 4096 points; modulation amplitude: 0.10 mT; modulation frequency: 100 kHz; gain: 900; microwave power: 6 mW. The results show a decrease in the EPR signal of superoxide anion, dependent on the concentration of compound (1) ( FIG. 2A ).
The EPR spectrum of the radical formed by reaction of compound (1) (40 μM) with superoxide anion (0.5 mM KO2 dissolved in DMSO by sonication) was recorded at room temperature ( FIG. 2B ). This EPR analysis was carried out with a MiniScope MS 100 EPR spectrometer, operating at a frequency of 9.5 GHz (X-band), with the following parameters: magnetic field: 336.0±1.9 mT; sweep time: 20 s; sampling: 4096 points; modulation amplitude: 0.05 mT; modulation frequency: 100 kHz; gain: 900; microwave power: 100 mW. This phenoxyl radical spectrum, centered around g =2.00, was simulated using the Rockenbauer and Korecz software (Rockenbauer, A.; Korecz, L. Automatic computer simulations of ESR spectra. Appl. Magn. Reson. 10:29-43; 1996), taking into account four proton coupling constants equal to 0.33, 0.16, 0.08 and 0.08 mT. The most likely attribution of these couplings corresponds to three protons of the catechol aromatic system and one proton of the pyrrole. The couplings to the other proton and to the nitrogen of the pyrrole ring are not resolved.
Example 4
Formation of a Quinone Intermediate by Reaction of Compound (1) with Superoxide Anion (O2∘−)
The product of the oxidation of compound (1) by superoxide anion in the organic phase (KO2 dissolved by sonication in DMSO) was characterized by HPLC (LC-Trap; Surveyor, Thermo). The reaction mixture (final volume 200 μL) consists of compound (1) at 1.6×10−3 M (20 μL in DMSO), treated or not with KO2, 10 μL (5 mM). The reaction mixture (20 μL) was injected on a Gemini column (C18, 2×150 mm, 5 Phenomenex), with initially 98% solvent A (A=H2O; 0.1% formic acid), and 2% solvent B (acetonitrile; 0.1% formic acid), at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. After 5 minutes, the gradient passed to 0% A and 100% B for 20 minutes. The results obtained ( FIG. 3A ) show that compound (1) having a retention time equal to 19.88 and m/z =310.20 (MH+) is partially transformed into compounds having inter alia a retention peak equal to 20.29 and m/z=308.17 (MH+). These results suggest the oxidation of compound (1) by superoxide anion.
The oxidation product of compound (1) by superoxide anion generated by K02 was analyzed by 13C NMR on a Brucker AVANCE-500 spectrometer. The results ( FIG. 3B ) show suppression of the signals corresponding to carbons 5 and 6 of compound (1) and the formation of two signals with a chemical shift of 182 ppm and 188.5 ppm, characteristic of quinones for the two carbons 5 and 6 of compound (1) treated.
Example 5
Formation of a Dimeric Compound MH+=631 “In Vitro” by Reaction of Compound (1) with Superoxide Anion (O2∘−) or at pH=pKa=8.89
The dimeric compound was formed after reaction of compound (1) (0.3×10−3 M) with superoxide anion generated by the xanthinexanthine oxidase complex, in PBSEDTA solvent.
The formation of the dimeric compound MH+ 631 was monitored on an HPLC Surveyor (Thermo), coupled to an LCQ Deca (Thermo). The reaction mixture (10 μL) was injected on a Gemini column (C18, 2×150 mm, 5 Phenomenex), with initially 98% solvent A (A=H2O; 0.1% formic acid) and 2% solvent B (acetonitrile; 0.1% formic acid), at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. After 5 minutes, the gradient passed to 0% A, 100% B for 20 minutes. The results obtained ( FIG. 4A ) show that compound (1) having a retention time equal to 19.71 and m/z=310.19 (MH+) is transformed into compounds having inter alia a retention peak equal to 20.63 and m/z=631.16 (MH+). In the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase, the dimeric compounds are not formed (results not shown). These results support the dimerization of compound (1) in the presence of superoxide anion.
In order to carry out the dimerization of compound (1) by oxidative coupling at pH equal to the pKa value of the compound, the theoretical pKa was determined by quantum calculations using the Gaussian03 software (Gaussian, Inc., Wallingford Conn., 2004) and a method adapted from Liptak et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 6421-6427), notably by modifying the default values of the PCMDOC, RADII, SCFVAC and TSARE parameters to make them compatible with the values of Gaussian98, the software used in the original publication. The pKa value obtained by this method was 8.89, the value which was then used to adjust the pH of a Tris-HCl 0.15 M, DMSO: 10% solution for the dimerization reaction of compound (1) at 0.3×10−2 M final. The reaction mixture (10 μL) was chromatographed by UHPLC (Waters, TQD, PDA, ELSD), on an HSS C18 column (Waters, 2.1×50 mm; 1.8 μm) with a solvent gradient initially containing 95% A (H2O, 0.1% formic acid) and 5% B (acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) then 100% solvent B in 6.5 minutes, at a flow rate of 0.6 ml per minute. The results, presented in FIG. 4B , show that compound (1), having a single peak at a retention time (tR) of 3.04 and m/z=310.19 (corresponding to the MH+ ion), is transformed into a compound whose retention time is tR=3.46 and m/z=631.40 (MH+). These results suggest that compound (1) is oxidized and dimerizes.
In order to obtain the dimer MH+ 631 in sufficient quantity to determine its structure, the oxidative coupling of 12 mg of compound (1) in Tris-HCl, 0.15 M, pH 9.4, DMSO solution (15% final) was carried out. After 48 hours, the reaction was stopped by several drops of 0.1 N HCl. The dimer MH+ 631 was separated on a C18 column, preparative HPLC (ACN, H2O, 0.1% formic acid), followed by extraction in the presence of a mixture of acetonitrile (50%) and ether (50%). After evaporation, the dimeric compound was dissolved in deuterated acetonitrile and analyzed by NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, HMBC, HSQC) (Brucker 600):
1H NMR (CD3CN; 263 K; 600 MHz) δ(ppm) ˜7.5 (1 H; sl); 7.33 (2 H; m); 7.26 (3 H; m); 7.17 (2 H; m); 7.13 (2 H; m); 7.05 (1 H; m); ˜7.0 (2 H; sl); 6.78 (2 H; m); 6.77 (1 H; s); 6.55 (1 H; s); 6.51 (1 H; d; J=2 Hz); 6.42 (1 H; d; J=2 Hz); 6.02 (1 H; s); 3.87 (2 H; t; J=7.2 Hz); 3.84 (2 H; t; J=7.2 Hz); 3.42; (2 H; t; J=5.4 Hz); 3.31; (2 H; t; J=5.4 Hz); 3.05 (1 H; sl); 2.97 (1 H; sl); 1.82; (2 H; quint; J=6.6 Hz); 1.70; (2 H; quint; J=6.6 Hz).
13C NMR (CD3CN; 263 K; 150 MHz) δ(ppm) 188.1; 182.8; 151.6; 145.1; 144.3; 143.1; 137.1; 136.1; 129.8; 129.54; 129.48; 129.4; 129.1; 128.8; 128.2; 127.3; 126.0; 125.4; 124.0; 123.8; 123.3; 123.1; 123.0; 122.6; 122.2; 120.6; 118.1; 114.5; 58.9; 58.8; 47.1; 46.7; 34.9; 34.2.
The proposed structure of the dimer is as follows:
The determination of the exact mass of the dimer (MH+: 631.2428) (C38H35N2O7) was carried out on an LCT Premier time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters). The UV spectrum of the dimeric compound was extracted from the chromatogram obtained on an Acquity system (Waters) equipped with a diode-array UV detector (Acquity PDA detector) ( FIG. 4C ).
Example 6
In Ovo Study of the Effect of Compound (1) on Tumor Angiogenesis
The effect of compound (1) on tumor angiogenesis was evaluated using the in ovo model based on human tumor grafted onto chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM).
This experimental approach makes it possible in only a few days to evaluate the tumor's progression and level of vascularization.
At the tenth day of embryonic development, glioblastoma cells (U87, 5×106 in 20 μL) were deposited on the chorioallantoic membrane. Two days after the graft, compound (1) at a concentration of 50 μM in a volume of 20 μL was deposited on the surface of the tumor formed. This treatment was repeated every 24 hours for 5 days. The control group was treated with solvent. The test was carried out on 20 eggs bearing glioblastoma tumors for each group. Images of the tumors were taken at day 3 (24 hours after treatment), at day 5 (3 days after treatment) and at day 7 (5 days after treatment) of tumor development. The results presented in FIG. 5A show an inhibition of tumor vascularization after 3 successive treatments (day 5), compared with the control group. This decrease in tumor vascularization also observed at day 7 of tumor development is associated with a significant inhibition of the growth of the treated tumor. These results show a peritumoral antiangiogenic and antitumor activity of compound (1). In order to determine the antiangiogenic mechanism of compound (1), VEGF was assayed by the ELISA method (Invitrogen, Novex technology), from the culture supernatant of U87 and HCT-116 cells, under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The results indicate ( FIG. 5B ) that compound (1), at concentrations of 5 to 50 does not modify VEGF secretion after 24 hours of treatment of the cells. These results suggest that the mechanism of peritumoral angiogenesis inhibition of compound (1) may be direct action on endothelial cells.
Example 7
In Ovo Study of the Effect of Compound (1) on Physiological Angiogenesis, on Vasculature Already Formed
The effect of compound (1) on physiological angiogenesis was evaluated using the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model which constitutes a richly vascularized tissue.
At the seventh day of embryonic development, 20 μL of the 50 μM solution of compound (1) was deposited on the chorioallantoic membrane whereas the control membranes were treated with solvent. The results presented in FIG. 6A show the absence of the effect of compound (1) on physiological angiogenesis, compared with the control group. These results suggest that compound (1) does not seem to act as an antivascular drug, not modifying the vasculature already formed.
Example 8
In Vitro Study of the Effect of Compound (1) on “de novo” Formation of Vascular Tubes
In order to monitor the effect of compound (1) on “de novo” formation of vascular tubes, human endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in a matrix (Matrigel), in the presence or absence of compound (1). After 24 hours, the effect of compound (1) is analyzed by optical microscopy and is illustrated by photographs. The results ( FIG. 6B ) show that compound (1) prevents the formation of capillaries (tubes formed from endothelial cells). Compound (1) thus acts directly on growing endothelial cells by blocking the formation of capillaries, in contrast to the absence of effect on a capillary network already formed, in the “quiescent” state.
Example 9
In Vitro Study of the Effect of Compound (1) on Quiescent or Growing Endothelial Cells
In order to understand the difference in the observed effects of compound (1) according to whether the vasculature is already formed or is growing “de novo”, vascular endothelial cells were cultured at two different cell densities so as to obtain proliferative phase cells or quiescent cells, then treated or not by compound (1), at 10 μM (IC50 value: 8 μM) for 48 hours. The results of FIG. 6C show that compound (1) acts only on endothelial cells in the proliferative phase (78% inhibition). This result thus makes it possible to define a specificity of action of compound (1) with respect to endothelial cells in intensive proliferation phase as during peritumoral angiogenesis, the “de novo” formation of vascular tubes or the proliferation of endothelial cells in culture. Compound (1) may thus be used to treat diseases associated with excessive and abnormal angiogenesis, like cancer or ARMD.
Example 10
In Vitro Biological Study on Cancer Cells
The biological activity of compound (1), as well as that of its structural analogues, was studied in vitro on 7 different cancer cell lines:
HCT-116 (colorectal cancer)
U87 (glioblastoma)
K562 (myeloid leukemia) and K562 R
MDA-MB 231 (mammary adenocarcinoma)
MCF-7 (mammary adenocarcinoma)
A549 (pulmonary alveolar adenocarcinoma)
The cells selected for this study were incubated at 37° C. in the presence of compound (1) added in the culture medium at various concentrations and at various times. The set of experiments carried out made it possible to determine the degree of cytotoxicity of the compound tested (IC50), its capacity to induce cell death by apoptosis, in close dependence on extracellular superoxide anion for its activation.
1. Study of the Effect of Compound (1) on Cell Growth
The effect of compound (1) on the growth of HCT-116, U87, K562, K562R, MDA-MB 231, MCF-7 and A549 cells, cultured in normoxia, was evaluated using a cell growth test (CellTiter-Blue™ Cell Viability Assay, Promega).
The results presented in FIG. 7A show the IC50 values (concentration of the compound which induces a 50% decrease in cell growth) determined after 72 hours of treatment with compound (1). It is 7.5 μM for the HCT-116 cells, 7 μM for the U87, 20 μM for the MDA-MB, 231.6 μM for the K562, 12.5 μM for the K562R, 15 μM for the MCF-7 and 15 μM for the A549. The results, presented in FIG. 7B , show the dose-dependent cytotoxic effect of compounds (2), (3), (4) and (5) on HCT-116 cells cultured in normoxia for 72 hours. The absence of catechol leads to the loss of cytotoxicity of compounds (2) and (3), whereas modification of the side chain by a butyl (5) or o-ethoxy (4) chain does not substantially change the IC50 value.
The results, presented in FIG. 8A , show the comparative cytotoxic effect of compound (1) and the dimer MH+ 631 previously obtained by oxidative coupling of compound (1) on HCT-116 cells cultured in normoxia, for 48 hours. The dimer is toxic, with an IC50 of 7.5 μM, half that of compound (1), due to the twofold molecular weight of the dimer (MW=630 d). The results, presented in FIG. 8B , show the comparative cytotoxic effect of compound (1) and the dimer MH+631 on HCT-116 cells cultured in hypoxia (2% O2) for 48 hours. The dimer is toxic, with an IC50 of 10 μM, approximately half that of compound (1), due to the twofold molecular weight of the dimer.
2. Study of the Effect of Compound (1) on the Induction of Apoptosis in Normoxia
In order to specify whether compound (1) leads to apoptotic cell death, the activity of caspases 3 and 7, marker enzymes of apoptosis, was measured using the ApoONE test (Promega) in HCT-116, U87 and HL60 cells treated in normoxia for 24 hours with compound (1) at concentrations varying from 1 μM to 50 μM. The results, presented in FIG. 9 , show that the treatment of cells with compound (1) induces a significant activation of both caspases, irrespective of the cell line. The strongest activation was obtained with HL60 cells.
3. Suppression of the Cellular Superoxide Anion Signal by Compound (1)
The effect of compound (1) on superoxide anion was studied following the treatment of HCT-116 cells with 50 μM compound (1) for 3 hours and followed by incubation with the probe dihydroethidium (DHE) (10 μM) for 20 minutes. After removing the culture medium and washing with ice-cold DPBS, the cells were collected in 1 ml of cold DPBS. After centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 minutes, the pellet was taken up in 150 μl of PBS with Triton X100 (0.1%), shaken and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was mixed with a 0.2 M solution of HClO4 in methanol, shaken and placed on ice for 2 hours. After centrifugation at 20000 g for 30 minutes, the supernatant is analyzed by HPLC coupled with fluorescence (λex=510 nm, λcm=595 nm). In the untreated cells (continuous line), the first peak at tR=5.16 minutes corresponds to the oxidized form “E+”, product of oxidation by peroxidases, and the second peak at tR =5.71 minutes to the oxidized form 2-OH E+, specific to the interaction with superoxide anion. In the treated cells, the first peak at tR=5.29 minutes corresponding to the oxidized form “E+” is increased, whereas the second peak at tR=5.71 minutes, corresponding to the oxidized form 2OH E+, specific to the interaction with superoxide anion, was suppressed. The results obtained show an inhibition of the 2OH E+ signal corresponding to the oxidized form of DHE by superoxide anion, and an increase in the E+ signal corresponding to oxidation of DHE by peroxidases or catalase, activated by H2O2. ( FIG. 10 ).
4. Dependence of Compound (1) on Extracellular/Membrane Superoxide Anion for Cytotoxic and Proapoptotic Action
In order to determine the role of superoxide anion, produced by the cells, in the activation of compound (1), HCT-116 cells were pretreated for 1 hour with the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD1) at 50 U/ml, then treated with compound (1). The cells were analyzed to evaluate, firstly, cell survival in normoxia (72 hours of treatment) and in hypoxia (48 hours of treatment). Secondly, the formation of condensed chromatin in normoxia and the activity of caspases 3 and 7 in normoxia were evaluated. The results, presented in FIG. 11A , show that the suppression of superoxide anion following treatment with SOD completely blocks the cytotoxic effect of compound (1) at 10 μM in normoxia and at 25 μM in hypoxia. Likewise, pretreatment with SOD completely suppresses the increase in condensed chromatin in normoxia visualized after staining with Hoechst 33258 ( FIG. 11B ). Similarly, the action of compound (1) on the activation of caspases 3-7 in normoxia is completely suppressed by the action of SOD ( FIG. 11C ). These results suggest that compound (1) is a prodrug specifically activatable by superoxide anion.
