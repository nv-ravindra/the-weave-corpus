BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is an important biological determinant of protein production and cellular differentiation and plays a significant pathogenic role in a number of human diseases.
Epigenetic regulation involves heritable modification of genetic material without changing its nucleotide sequence. Typically, epigenetic regulation is mediated by selective and reversible modification (e.g., methylation) of DNA and proteins (e.g., histones) that control the conformational transition between transcriptionally active and inactive states of chromatin. These covalent modifications can be controlled by enzymes such as methyltransferases (e.g., CARM1 (co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1; PRMT4)), many of which are associated with specific genetic alterations that can cause human disease.
Disease-associated chromatin-modifying enzymes play a role in diseases such as proliferative disorders, autoimmune disorders, muscular disorders, and neurological disorders. Thus, there is a need for the development of small molecules that are capable of inhibiting the activity of CARM1.

โCondition,โ โdisease,โ and โdisorderโ are used interchangeably herein.
โTreat,โ โtreatingโ and โtreatmentโ encompasses an action that occurs while a subject is suffering from a condition which reduces the severity of the condition or retards or slows the progression of the condition (โtherapeutic treatmentโ). โTreat,โ โtreatingโ and โtreatmentโ also encompasses an action that occurs before a subject begins to suffer from the condition and which inhibits or reduces the severity of the condition (โprophylactic treatmentโ).
An โeffective amountโ of a compound refers to an amount sufficient to elicit the desired biological response, e.g., treat the condition. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in this art, the effective amount of a compound described herein may vary depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint, the pharmacokinetics of the compound, the condition being treated, the mode of administration, and the age and health of the subject. An effective amount encompasses therapeutic and prophylactic treatment.
A โtherapeutically effective amountโ of a compound is an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of a condition or to delay or minimize one or more symptoms associated with the condition. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound means an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other therapies, which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of the condition. The term โtherapeutically effective amountโ can encompass an amount that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of the condition, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent.
A โprophylactically effective amountโ of a compound is an amount sufficient to prevent a condition, or one or more symptoms associated with the condition or prevent its recurrence. A prophylactically effective amount of a compound means an amount of a therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other agents, which provides a prophylactic benefit in the prevention of the condition. The term โprophylactically effective amountโ can encompass an amount that improves overall prophylaxis or enhances the prophylactic efficacy of another prophylactic agent.
As used herein, the term โmethyltransferaseโ represents transferase class enzymes that are able to transfer a methyl group from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule, e.g., an amino acid residue of a protein or a nucleic base of a DNA molecule. Methytransferases typically use a reactive methyl group bound to sulfur in S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. In some embodiments, a methyltransferase described herein is a protein methyltransferase. In some embodiments, a methyltransferase described herein is a histone methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases (HMT) are histone-modifying enzymes, (including histone-lysine N-methyltransferase and histone-arginine N-methyltransferase), that catalyze the transfer of one or more methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues of histone proteins. In certain embodiments, a methyltransferase described herein is a histone-arginine N-methyltransferase.

Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.
In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are typically suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds described herein with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active ingredient.
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active ingredient is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may comprise buffering agents.
Solid compositions of a similar type can be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally comprise opacifying agents and can be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type can be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
The active ingredient can be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above.

Compounds and compositions described herein are generally useful for the inhibition of CARM1. In some embodiments, the CARM1 is human CARM1. In some embodiments, methods of treating CARM1-mediated disorder in a subject are provided which comprise administering an effective amount of a compound described herein (e.g., a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), to a subject in need of treatment. In certain embodiments, the effective amount is a therapeutically effective amount. In certain embodiments, the effective amount is a prophylactically effective amount. In certain embodiments, the subject is suffering from a CARM1-mediated disorder. In certain embodiments, the subject is susceptible to a CARM1-mediated disorder.
As used herein, the term โCARM1-mediated disorderโ means any disease, disorder, or other pathological condition in which CARM1 is known to play a role. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present disclosure relates to treating or lessening the severity of one or more diseases in which CARM1 is known to play a role.
In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides a method of inhibiting CARM1 comprising contacting CARM1 with an effective amount of a compound described herein, e.g., a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The CARM1 may be purified or crude, and may be present in a cell, tissue, or subject. Thus, such methods encompass both inhibition of in vitro and in vivo CARM1 activity. In certain embodiments, the method is an in vitro method, e.g., such as an assay method. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that inhibition of CARM1 does not necessarily require that all of the CARM1 be occupied by an inhibitor at once. Exemplary levels of inhibition of CARM1 include at least 10% inhibition, about 10% to about 25% inhibition, about 25% to about 50% inhibition, about 50% to about 75% inhibition, at least 50% inhibition, at least 75% inhibition, about 80% inhibition, about 90% inhibition, and greater than 90% inhibition.
In some embodiments, provided is a method of inhibiting CARM1 activity in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound described herein (e.g., a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.
In certain embodiments, provided is a method of modulating gene expression or activity in a cell which comprises contacting a cell with an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In certain embodiments, the cell in culture in vitro. In certain embodiments, the cell is in an animal, e.g., a human. In certain embodiments, the cell is in a subject in need of treatment.
In certain embodiments, provided is a method of modulating transcription in a cell which comprises contacting a cell with an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In certain embodiments, the cell in culture in vitro. In certain embodiments, the cell is in an animal, e.g., a human. In certain embodiments, the cell is in a subject in need of treatment.
In certain embodiments, a method is provided of selecting a therapy for a subject having a disease associated with CARM1-mediated disorder or mutation comprising the steps of determining the presence of CARM1-mediated disorder or gene mutation in the CARM1 gene or and selecting, based on the presence of CARM1-mediated disorder a gene mutation in the CARM1 gene a therapy that includes the administration of a provided compound. In certain embodiments, the disease is cancer.
In certain embodiments, a method of treatment is provided for a subject in need thereof comprising the steps of determining the presence of CARM1-mediated disorder or a gene mutation in the CARM1 gene and treating the subject in need thereof, based on the presence of a CARM1-mediated disorder or gene mutation in the CARM1 gene with a therapy that includes the administration of a provided compound. In certain embodiments, the subject is a cancer patient.
In some embodiments, a compound provided herein is useful in treating a proliferative disorder, such as cancer. For example, while not being bound to any particular mechanism, protein arginine methylation by CARM1 is a modification that has been implicated in signal transduction, gene transcription, DNA repair and mRNA splicing, among others; and overexpression of CARM1 within these pathways is often associated with various cancers. Thus, compounds which inhibit the action of PRMTs, and specifically CARM1, as provided herein, are effective in the treatment of cancer.
In some embodiments, compounds provided herein are effective in treating cancer through the inhibition of CARM1. For example, CARM1 levels have been shown to be elevated in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (e.g., see Di Lorenzo et al., Drugs (2010) 70:983-1000), as well as in aggressive breast tumors (Hong et al., Cancer 2004 101, 83-89; El Messaoudi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 2006, 103, 13351-13356; Majumder et al., Prostate 2006 66, 1292-1301). Thus, in some embodiments, inhibitors of CARM1, as described herein, are useful in treating cancers associated with aberrant CARM1 activity, e.g., CARM1 overexpression or aberrant protein methylation. For example, aberrant CARM1 activity has been found in prostate cancer (e.g., see Hong et al., Cancer (2004), 101:83-89); plays a coactivator role in the dysragulation of beta-catenin activity in colorectal cancer (e.g., see Ou et al., Mol. Cancer Res. (2011) 9:660); and has been linked to estrogen signaling and estrogen related cancers such as breast cancer (see, e.g., Teyssiewr et al., Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010) 21:181-189). CARM1 has also been shown to affect estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) dependent breast cancer cell differentiation and proliferation (Al-Dhaheri et al., Cancer Res. 2011 71, 2118-2128), thus in some aspects CARM1 inhibitors, as described herein, are useful in treating ERฮฑ-dependent breast cancer by inhibiting cell differentiation and proliferation. In another example, CARM1 has been shown to be recruited to the promoter of E2F1 (which encodes a cell cycle regulator) as a transcriptional co-activator (Frietze et al., Cancer Res. 2008 68, 301-306). Thus, CARM1-mediated upregulation of E2F1 expression may contribute to cancer progression and chemoresistance as increased abundance of E2F1 triggers invasion and metastasis by activating growth receptor signaling pathways, which in turn promote an antiapoptotic tumor environment (Engelmann and Ptitzer, Cancer Res 2012 72; 571). Accordingly, in some embodiments, the inhibition of CARM1, e.g., by compounds provided herein, is useful in treating cancers associated with E2F1 upregulation, e.g., such as lung cancer (see, e.g., Eymin et al., Oncogene (2001) 20:1678-1687), and breast cancer (see, e.g., Brietz et al., Cancer Res. (2008) 68:301-306). Thus, without being bound by any particular mechanism, the inhibition of CARM1, e.g., by compounds described herein, is beneficial in the treatment of cancer. CARM1 overexpression has also been demonstrated to be elevated in 75% of colorectal cancers (Kim et al., BMC Cancer, 10, 197). It has been additionally been determined that depletion of CARM1 in WNT/ฮฒ-catenin dysregulated colorectal cancer suppressed anchorage independent growth (Ou et al., Mol. Cancer. Res., 2011 9, 660-670). This, in some embodiments, the inhibition of CARM1, e.g. by compounds provided herein, is useful in colorectal cancer associated with elevated CARM1 expression or dysregulated WNT/ฮฒ-catenin signaling.
In some embodiments, compounds described herein are useful for treating a cancer including, but not limited to, acoustic neuroma, adenocarcinoma, adrenal gland cancer, anal cancer, angiosarcoma (e.g., lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma), appendix cancer, benign monoclonal gammopathy, biliary cancer (e.g., cholangiocarcinoma), bladder cancer, breast cancer (e.g., adenocarcinoma of the breast, papillary carcinoma of the breast, mammary cancer, medullary carcinoma of the breast), brain cancer (e.g., meningioma; glioma, e.g., astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma; medulloblastoma), bronchus cancer, carcinoid tumor, cervical cancer (e.g., cervical adenocarcinoma), choriocarcinoma, chordoma, craniopharyngioma, colorectal cancer (e.g., colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal adenocarcinoma), epithelial carcinoma, ependymoma, endotheliosarcoma (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple idiopathic hemorrhagic sarcoma), endometrial cancer (e.g., uterine cancer, uterine sarcoma), esophageal cancer (e.g., adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, Barrett's adenocarinoma), Ewing sarcoma, eye cancer (e.g., intraocular melanoma, retinoblastoma), familiar hypereosinophilia, gall bladder cancer, gastric cancer (e.g., stomach adenocarcinoma), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), head and neck cancer (e.g., head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, oral cancer (e.g., oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), throat cancer (e.g., laryngeal cancer, pharyngeal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, oropharyngeal cancer)), hematopoietic cancers (e.g., leukemia such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (e.g., B-cell ALL, T-cell ALL), acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) (e.g., B-cell AML, T-cell AML), chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) (e.g., B-cell CML, T-cell CML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (e.g., B-cell CLL, T-cell CLL); lymphoma such as Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (e.g., B-cell HL, T-cell HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (e.g., B-cell NHL such as diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) (e.g., diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)), follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLUSLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (e.g., mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (i.e., โWaldenstrbm's macroglobulinemiaโ), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), immunoblastic large cell lymphoma, precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma; and T-cell NHL such as precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (e.g., cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) (e.g., mycosis fungiodes, Sezary syndrome), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, extranodal natural killer T-cell lymphoma, enteropathy type T-cell lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma); a mixture of one or more leukemia/lymphoma as described above; and multiple myeloma (MM)), heavy chain disease (e.g., alpha chain disease, gamma chain disease, mu chain disease), hemangioblastoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, immunocytic amyloidosis, kidney cancer (e.g., nephroblastoma a.k.a.

In certain embodiments, the cancer is a solid cancer. In certain embodiments, the cancer is a liquid cancer.

Compound Synthesis
Scheme 1 shows a general synthesis route to compounds of Formula I-(ii) wherein R3โฒ is the same as R3 as defined above or is a suitable precursor that may be converted to R3. This method is based on Suzuki coupling reactions of heteroaryl chloride intermediates of general Formula XI-(ii) with pinacol borane intermediates of general Formula X. In a first step, Suzuki coupling reaction of these intermediates is typically conducted in the presence of a palladium catalyst (e.g. PdCl2(dppf)) and a base (e.g. potassium carbonate) in an organic solvent (e.g. toluene) at elevated temperature. In a second optional set of steps the R3โฒ group as well as other groups in the molecule may be converted to the defined final substituents in Formula I-(ii). In a final deprotection step the N-Boc protecting is removed by for example using an acid (e.g. HCl) in a suitable organic solvent (e.g. ethanol) to give certain corresponding embodiments of compounds of Formula I-(ii).
Compounds of general Formula XI-(ii) can be prepared from heteroaryl dichlorides of general Formula XX-(ii) as depicted in Scheme 2. In certain embodiments when L is โN(RL)โ, โC(O)N(RL)โ, or โOC(O)N(RL)โ, โ NRLC(O)N(RL)โ, Buchwald coupling of XX-(ii) respectively with active amines R3โฒN(RL)H, amides R3โฒC(O)N(RL)H, carbamates โOC(O)N(RL)H, or ureas โ NRLC(O)N(RL)H, may be implemented in the first step.
In certain embodiments when L1 is a bond, and the monocyclic heterocycle core structure is directly attached to R3โฒ by a carbon-carbon bond, Suzuki coupling of XXI-(i) with boronic acids or ester intermediates R3โฒB(OH)2 may be implemented to yield the corresponding certain embodiments of XI-(ii). In certain embodiments the formation of compounds of Formula XI-(ii) using the methods described above can be accompanied by formation of the regioisomeric intermediate compounds of Formula XI-(i)-a. In certain embodiments when a mixture of XI-(ii) and XI-(ii)-regioisomers is formed they may be separated by chromatography. Intermediates of Formula XI-(ii)-a may in turn be implemented to prepare compounds of the invention using the same general method described in Scheme 1.
In certain embodiments wherein X in general Formulas I-(ii) is O, pinacol borane intermediates of general Formula X can be prepared using standard methods as depicted in Scheme 3. Thus, in a first step 3-bromophenols of general structure XXX are treated with epibromohydrin to give epoxides XXXI. Opening of the epoxide group of intermediates XXXI in with amines of Formula R1NH2 in an organic solvent with heating as necessary followed by protection of the resulting amine with Boc-anhydride gives intermediates XXXII. TBS protection of the alcohol group in the next step using t-butyldimethylsilyltriflate gives intermediate bromides XXXIII. In a final step the Br group is converted to the pinacol borane function to give intermediates XX under standard Suzuki-Miyura conditions.
Certain heteroaryl dichlorides of general Formula XX-(ii) are commercially available. Certain embodiments of general structure XX-(ii) may be prepared by known methods. For example embodiments of intermediates of general structure XX-(ii)-x may be prepared from trichloropyrimidine intermediates L-(ii)-x as depicted in Scheme 4. In certain embodiments Suzuki coupling of L-(ii)-x with aryl or heteroaryl boronates gives intermediate compounds of Formula L-(ii)-x a wherein R11 is aryl or heteroaryl. In certain embodiments Buchwald coupling of L-(i)-x with primary or secondary cyclic (e.g. morpholine) or acyclic amines gives intermediate compounds of Formula L-(ii)-x a wherein R11 is an acyclic or cyclic amino group.

General Procedure for CARM1 Enzyme Assays on Peptide Substrates
The assays were all performed in a buffer consisting of 20 mM Bicine (pH=7.6), 1 mM TCEP, 0.005% BSG, and 0.002% Tween 20, prepared on the day of use. Compounds in 100% DMSO (1 ul) were spotted into a polypropylene 384-well V-bottom plates (Greiner) using a Platemate Plus outfitted with a 384-channel head (Thermo Scientific). DMSO (1 ul) was added to Columns 11, 12, 23, 24, rows A-H for the maximum signal control and 1 ul of SAH, a known product and inhibitor of CARM1, was added to columns 11, 12, 23, 24, rows I-P for the minimum signal control. A cocktail (40 ul) containing the CARM1 enzyme was added by Multidrop Combi (Thermo-Fisher). The compounds were allowed to incubate with CARM1 for 30 min at room temperature, then a cocktail (10 ul) containing 3H-SAM and peptide was added to initiate the reaction (final volume=51 ul). The final concentrations of the components were as follows: CARM1 was 0.25 nM, 3H-SAM was 30 nM, peptide was 250 nM, SAH in the minimum signal control wells was 1 mM, and the DMSO concentration was 2%. The assays were stopped by the addition of non-radiolabeled SAM (10 ul) to a final concentration of 300 uM, which dilutes the 3H-SAM to a level where its incorporation into the peptide substrate is no longer detectable. 50 ul of the reaction in the 384-well polypropylene plate was then transferred to a 384-well Flashplate and the biotinylated peptides were allowed to bind to the streptavidin surface for at least 1 hour before being washed once with 0.1% Tween20 in a Biotek ELx405 plate washer. The plates were then read in a PerkinElmer TopCount plate reader to measure the quantity of 3H-labeled peptide bound to the Flashplate surface, measured as disintegrations per minute (dpm) or alternatively, referred to as counts per minute (cpm).
where dpm=disintegrations per minute, cmpd=signal in assay well, and min and max are the respective minimum and maximum signal controls.
where top and bottom are the normally allowed to float, but may be fixed at 100 or 0 respectively in a 3-parameter fit. The Hill Coefficient normally allowed to float but may also be fixed at 1 in a 3-parameter fit. Y is the % inhibition and X is the compound concentration.  RKO Methylation Assay

Cell treatment, In Cell Western (ICW) for detection of asymmetric di-methyl PABP1 and DNA content: RKO cells were seeded in assay medium at a concentration of 30,000 cells per mL to a poly-D-lysine coated 384 well culture plate (BD Biosciences 356697) with 50 ฮผL per well. Compound (100 nL) from a 96-well source plate was added directly to 384 well cell plate. Plates were incubated at 37ยฐ C., 5% CO2 for 48 hours. After two days of incubation, plates were brought to room temperature outside of the incubator for ten minutes and blotted on paper towels to remove cell media. Cells were fixed for 20 minutes at room temperature by adding 50 ul of 8% PFA followed by aspiration of supernatant with the Biotek EL406 plate washer. Cells were then permeabilized by addition of 50 ฮผL of ice cold 100% methanol directly to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After 30 min, plates were transferred to a Biotek ELA06 plate washer and washed 2 times with 100 ฮผL per well of wash buffer (1รPBS). Next 60 ฮผL per well of Odyssey blocking buffer (Odyssey Buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) were added to each plate and incubated 1 hour at room temperature. Blocking buffer was removed and 20 ฮผL per well of primary antibody was added (asymmetric-methyl PABP1) diluted 1:400 in Odyssey buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) and plates were incubated overnight (16 hours) at 4ยฐ C. Plates were washed 5 times with 100 ฮผL per well of wash buffer. Next 20 ฮผL per well of secondary antibody was added (1:800 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody, 1:2000 DRAQ5 in Odyssey buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed 5 times with 100 ฮผL per well wash buffer then 2 times with 100 ฮผL per well of water. Plates were allowed to dry at room temperature then imaged on the Licor Odyssey machine which measures integrated intensity at 700 nm and 800 nm wavelengths. Both 700 and 800 channels were scanned.
Calculations.
First, the ratio for each well was determined by:
Each plate included fourteen control wells of DMSO only treatment (minimum inhibition) as well as fourteen control wells for maximum inhibition treated with 20 ฮผM of a reference compound. The average of the ratio values for each control type was calculated and used to determine the percent activation for each test well in the plate. Reference compound was serially diluted three-fold in DMSO for a total of nine test concentrations, beginning at 20 ฮผM.
Percent inhibition was determined and IC50 curves were generated using triplicate wells per concentration of compound.
Human Myeloma Cell Line Proliferation Assay
Human Multiple Myeloma cell lines NCI-H929 ( FIG. 1A ) and U266B1 ( FIG. 1B ) were treated with varying doses of 304-1a (medium grey data points), 23-3 (light grey data points), and 113-3 (black data points) in a 14-day proliferation assay. At the end of the experiment, total cell number was determined for each cell line for different doses of 304-1a, 23-3, and 113-3. As shown below, all compounds tested decreased the proliferation of these cell lines, at potencies consistent with that seen for the biochemical and cell-based (PARP1me2a) ICW (In Cell Western) assays.
