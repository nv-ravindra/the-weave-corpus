BACKGROUND
Certain embodiments are directed to the fields of chemistry and medicine. Certain aspects are directed to compounds for treating chronic pancreatitis, colon cancer, or liver fibrosis.
Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive, non-curable disorder of the pancreas (Schneider and Whitcomb, 2002, Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol 16:347). Pathologically, both the endocrine and exocrine pancreas undergo progressive and often irreversible morphological changes, including glandular fibrosis (Bordalo et al. 1977, Am J Gastroenterol 68:278; Shimizu 2008, Gastroenterol 43:823; Sahel and Sarles 1979, Dig Dis Sci 24:897; Witt et al. 2007, Gastroenterology 132:15570). In the United States, disorders of the exocrine pancreas affect over 1 million patients and result in a cost of over $3.7 billion annually (Yang et al. 2008, Arch Intern Med 168:649; Everhart and Ruhl 2009, Gastroenterology 136:376). Current treatment options for CP are limited to supportive and palliative care; patients with advanced disease can be managed with endoscopic and/or surgical pancreatic decompression, denervation, resection, bypass, or transplantation (Trikudanathan et al. 2012, Gastroenterol Clin North Am 41:63; Forsmark 2013, Gastroenterology 144:1282). Overall, patients have a poor quality of life, and are burdened by chronic abdominal pain, increased hospitalizations, impaired digestion, diarrhea, weight loss, diabetes, complications like pseudocysts and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (Forsmark 2013, Gastroenterology 144:1282). Therefore, the development of effective, safe and affordable therapeutic agents remains a critical need.
SUMMARY
Classes of small molecules can be developed as highly potent and orally active agents for the prevention and treatment of various fibrosis and cancers including but not limited to pancreatic fibrosis, liver fibrosis, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, brain tumors, head/neck cancer, prostate and lung cancers as well as other inflammation. These molecules may also be useful research tools and therapeutics as cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) inhibitors to target H2S-signaling for a wide range of human diseases.
Accumulating evidence suggests that activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) play an important role in chronic pancreatitis (CP), and inhibition of the activated PSC is considered as a potential strategy for the treatment and prevention of CP. Herein, the inventors disclose findings that apigenin and its novel analogues suppress the proliferation and induce apoptosis in PSC which reduce the PSC-mediated fibrosis in CP. Chemical modifications of apigenin have been directed to build a focused library of O-alkylamino-tethered apigenin derivatives at 4′-O position of the ring C with the attempt to enhance the potency and drug-like properties including aqueous solubility. A number of compounds such as 14 (HJC-5-56), 16 (HJC-5-57), and 24 (HJC-5-100) exhibited potent antiproliferative effects as well as improved aqueous solubility. Intriguingly, apigenin, new analogues 23 (HJC-5-61) and 24 (HJC-5-100) displayed significant efficacy to reduce pancreatic fibrosis even at a low dose of 0.5 mg/kg in our proof-of-concept study using a preclinical in vivo mouse model of CP.

DESCRIPTION
Within the last two decades, it has been well-established that pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) are responsible for the fibrotic component of chronic pancreatitis (CP), and suppressing PSC is therefore a potential therapeutic target for the disease (Erkan et al. 2008, Gut 61:172; Jaster and Emmrich 2008, J. Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol 22:17; Masamune et al. 2009, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 7:S48). In the normal pancreas, PSC are inactive/quiescent, whereas during tissue injury, PSC display an activated, myofibroblastic phenotype, with increased proliferation, motility, and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins (Erkan et al. 2008, Gut 61:172; Jaster and Emmrich 2008, J. Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol 22:17; Masamune et al. 2009, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 7:S48). CP favors the perpetual activation of PSC (Madro et al. 2011 Adv Med Sci 56:132). Consequently, a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of CP involves limiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of activated PSC (Madro et al. 2011, Adv Med Sci 56:132; Gao et al. 2013, Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 304:G804; Spector et al. 2010, Pancreas 39:1008; He et al. 2009, Biochim Biophys Acta 1792:56).
The sentinel acute pancreatitis event (SAPE) hypothesis provides a unified model for the pathogenesis of CP (Whitcomb 1999, Gut 45:317). After studying cases of hereditary pancreatitis, Whitcomb et al. found that 50% of patients with gain-of-function trypsinogen mutations experienced repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis (AP) that later developed into CP (Schneider and Whitcomb 2002, Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol 16:347; Whitcomb 1999, Gut 45:317). Regardless of the inciting etiology(s) of the sentinel event of AP, recurrent episodes of AP cause CP. AP is initiated with acinar cell injury, characterized by premature acinar zymogen activation, recruitment of inflammatory cells, auto-digestion and necrosis of acinar and ductal cells, subsequent anti-inflammatory response, and PSC-dependent scarring (Schneider and Whitcomb 2002, Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol 16:347; Witt et al. 2007, Gastroenterology 132:1557; Whitcomb 1999, Gut 45:317; Kloppel and Maillet 1993, Pancreas 8:659; Comfort et al. 1946, Gastroenterology 6:376). Recurrent pancreatic injury overwhelms normal repair mechanisms, favoring progressive irreversible fibrosis (Schneider and Whitcomb 2002, Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol 16:347; Witt et al. 2007, Gastroenterology 132:1557; Whitcomb 1999, Gut 45:317). Compounds described herein have been developed to limit repeated pancreatic injury, and thus minimize the progression of CP.
I. Apigenin and Related Compounds
Natural products, especially common dietaries consumed on a daily basis, continue to serve as a valuable source in developing drug-like candidates for chemoprevention and chemotherapy (Koehn and Carter 2005, Nat Rev Drug Discov 4:206; Harvey 2008, Drug Discov Today 13:894; Li and Vederas 2009, Science 325:161). Flavonoids, which are ubiquitously distributed in many dietary plant materials, have received a great deal of attention because some of them have been shown to exert various beneficial effects on human health (Srinivas 2009, Curr Clin Pharmacol 4:67).
Apigenin (4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavone) is found in many plants, is a natural product belonging to the flavone class that is the aglycone of several naturally occurring glycosides. Apigenin is abundantly present in common fruits and vegetables, and has gained particular interest in recent years as a beneficial and health-promoting agent because of its low intrinsic toxicity (Shukla and Gupta 2010, Pharm Res 27:962). Apigenin has been demonstrated to possess various clinically relevant properties such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antiproliferative, and pro-apoptotic activities likely through multiple mechanisms (Patel et al. 2007, Int J Oncol 30:233). Research efforts on this natural product with low intrinsic toxicity have led the inventors to discover that apigenin can ameliorate the stromal fibrosis characteristic of CP.
Despite its promising anti-fibrotic property, apigenin suffers from poor aqueous solubility and low metabolic stability like most flavonoids, limiting its clinical potential. While many research groups focused on developing novel compounds based on the apigenin structure as anticancer agents, most of these apigenin derivatives suffered from unfavorable physicochemical properties, including limited aqueous solubility, and none of them has been approved for clinical investigation (Keller et al. 2006, Curr Opin Chem Biol 10:357; Di et al. 2009, Curr Pharm Des 15:2184). As described herein, the inventors describe the design and synthesis of novel apigenin analogues that suppress the proliferation and promote apoptosis in activated PSC with improved potency and favorable physicochemical properties. The inventors also disclose that at a low dose, analogues 23 and 24 are as efficacious as apigenin in reducing pancreatic fibrosis in a preclinical animal model, providing the proof-of-concept as potential therapeutics for CP.
Considerable efforts on the modifications of apigenin as the lead compound in anticancer drug design have been made. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies indicate that the A ring of apigenin as well as its C ring are suitable for modifications (Manthey and Guthrie 2002, J Agric Food Chem 50:5837; Chan et al. 2006, J Med Chem 49:6742; Lin et al. 2007, J Med Chem 50:3921; Wong et al. 2009, J Med Chem 52:5311). In addition, studies have demonstrated that the polymethoxylated flavones or flavone analogues with nonpolar and hydrophobic substituents on A ring generally exhibit more potent antiproliferative activities against various human cancer cell lines (Manthey and Guthrie 2002, J Agric Food Chem 50:5837; Walle 2007, Mol Pharm 4:826). Moreover, methylated flavones have dramatically higher intestinal permeability and higher metabolic stability (Gradolatto et al. 2004, Drug Metab Dispos 32:58; Gradolatto et al. 2005, Drug Metab Dispos 33:49; Wen and Walle 2006, Drug Metab Dispos 34:1786). Combined with the structural features of the SAR trends, optimization efforts were directed to discover novel apigenin derivatives by introducing aqueous solubility-enhancing moieties at 4′-O position of apigenin with 5,7-dimethoxy groups on the A ring.
The synthesis of apigenin derivatives with chemical optimizations on 4′-hydroxyl group is outlined in Scheme 1. The key intermediate 5 was prepared in a three-step synthesis starting with 1-(2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanone (2) and 4-allyloxybenzaldehyde (3) according to a literature procedure (Chan et al. 2009, ChemMedChem 4:594). As shown in Scheme 1, base-catalyzed aldol condensation of 2 with 3 afforded the chalcone 4 in a yield of 76% with a simple purification. The chalcone was cyclized in the presence of catalytic iodine in dimethyl sulfoxide at 140° C. to provide the flavone 5 in high yield. The allyl protecting group of flavones 5 was cleaved with a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh3)4 in the presence of K2CO3 in MeOH at reflux for 4 hours to obtain the intermediate 4′-hydroxyflavone 6 for direct use without further purification.
Analogues 7-13 were synthesized by Mitsunobu reaction of the intermediate 6 with appropriate substituted alcohols in high yields (81-94%). Alkylation of the bromide intermediate 7 with the corresponding amine in the presence of K2CO3 and KI in acetone introduced basic functionalities providing final compounds 14-18 in 66-99% yields. Mitsunobu coupling of 6 with N-Boc-protected amino alcohols followed by the Boc-deprotection with the treatment of TFA in CH2Cl2 afforded analogues 19-21 with diversified O-alkylamino side chains in 59-90% yields (two steps).
The synthetic route to 3-amino-2-hydroxypropoxy-flavonesis is outlined in Scheme 2. The reaction of the key intermediate 6 with excessive epichlorohydrin (22) and successive treatment of the intermediate epoxide (23) with appropriate amines under reflux afforded the desired derivatives 24-26 in yields of 71-94%. The Mitsunobu coupling of 6 with (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methanol (solketal, 27) generated an intermediate which was subjected to cleavage conditions using 0.5% HCl (aq.) in EtOH to produce the 1,2-diol derivative 28. For the synthesis of diversified apigenin analogues on side chain of the ring C at para-position as depicted in Scheme 3, the starting material 2 was condensed with 4-bromobenzaldehyde (29) to give chalcone 30, which was then cyclized to give the intermediate 31. Compound 33 was obtained by Suzuki coupling reaction of 31 with 2-fluoropyridine-5-boronic acid (32) in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2 catalyst in a yield of 85%. Palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig amination reaction of 31 with N,N-dimethylethylenediamine (34) or 2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethanamine (35) afforded the targeted compounds 36 and 37 in yield of 64% and 57%, respectively.
Scheme 4 outlines the synthesis of demethylated derivatives 38 and 39. Generation of 38 was achieved in 79% yield by a mono-demethylation of 16 using 2 equiv of boron tribromide at room temperate for 2 h. Both methyl groups on A-ring of 16 were successfully removed by treatment with 3 equiv of boron tribromide for 24 h, leading to the demethylated analogue 39 in a yield of 73%.
The calculated lipophilicity (cLogP) and topological polar surface area (tPSA) values of synthesized analogues are listed in Table 1. The results indicate that these compounds meet the criteria of Lipinski's “Rule of Five” and may have favorable physicochemical properties. To explore a meaningful SAR and examine how the substitutions on the key moieties affect biological activities of apigenin derivatives, the inventors first evaluated the in vitro antiproliferative effects of these analogues on transformed PSC using AlamarBlue Cell Viability Assay (Life Technologies) as described below. AlamarBlue is a non-toxic reagent that is converted to a highly fluorescent end product by viable cells. The capabilities of these new analogues to inhibit the proliferation of transformed PSC are summarized in Table 1.  TABLE 1

Intermediate 6 was found to display no significant antiproliferative effect even at 20 μM. After introduction of an O-bromoalkyl moiety or an O-fluoroalkyl moiety into the derivative 6 at 4′-O position, compounds 7 and 8 showed a slightly increased antiproliferative effects in comparison with 6, indicating that appropriate modifications on 4′-O position may regain the antiproliferative activity. O-Alkylamino-tethered derivatives 9, 10 and 12 exhibited a moderate antiproliferative activity at 10 μM with inhibitory effects of 49%, 51%, and 59%, respectively. This finding suggests that optimization with a nitrogen-containing hydrophilic moiety at 4′-O position appears to be a viable strategy to yield more potent compounds with a better aqueous solubility. To this end, compounds 14 with a piperidinyl moiety and 16 with a pyrrolidinyl group displayed potent antiproliferative activity at 10 μM with inhibitory effects of 64% and 66%, respectively.
Meanwhile, it was found that the tertiary amines with alkylated amino groups appeared to be more favorable than secondary or primary amines with free amino groups at the terminal of the side chains. For instance, in comparison with compounds 14 and 16, analogues 19-21 only exhibited a moderate to low inhibitory effects. The similar trend of SAR was also observed for derivatives 24-26 and 28. Compound 28 with a terminal OH group at the tail resulted in a dramatic loss of activities compared with analogues 24-26 with a terminal amino moiety. Interestingly, compound 23 with an epoxide was identified as a highly potent inhibitor suppressing PSC proliferation.
Structural modifications of para-position on C-ring with diversified substitutions were also investigated. Compound 33 with a pyridinyl group on the para-position resulted in a substantial loss of the activity. In contrast, introduction of 2-dimethylamino-ethylamino moiety or 2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethylamino group displayed significantly better antiproliferative activities at 10 μM with inhibitory effects of 60% and 51%, respectively. Demethylation of compound 16 resulted in generation of two O-demethylated compounds 38 and 39. It was found that neither mono-demethylation nor full demethylation of the methoxy groups on the A-ring is favorable for the enhancement of activity, and thus more extensive SAR study on the A-ring was not pursued.
Since one goal of the drug discovery effort was to identify new apigenin derivatives with improved water-solubility and oral bioavailability, aqueous solubility of several selected analogues with enhanced antiproliferative effects was determined by an HPLC analysis method (Chen et al. 2013, ACS Med Chem Lett 4:180). As depicted in FIG. 1 , compounds 14, 16 and 24 (in the form of HCl salt) have demonstrated to possess more favorable aqueous solubility, with a saturated concentration of 17.4, 13.7 and 84.1 mg/mL, respectively, while that of apigenin is only 2.16 μg/mL (Keller et al. 2006, Curr Opin Chem Biol 10:357).
To investigate more detailed information about the antiproliferative effects of this series of apigenin derivatives against human PSC, compounds 23 (HJC0561) and 24 (HJC05100) were selected based on their potency or aqueous solubility for further evaluations using cell proliferation and cell death assays, as well as an in vivo model of CP. As shown in FIG. 2A , both analogues 23 and 24 inhibited PSC proliferation at lower doses than apigenin, indicating enhanced potency in vitro. With logarithmic transformation and nonlinear regression, a best-fit curve was generated, allowing determination of their IC50, representing the concentration at which the compound causes 50% inhibition of PSC proliferation ( FIG. 2B ). Compound 23 was identified as a highly potent analogue with an IC50 value of 2.5±0.6 μM. Compound 24 was slightly less potent with an IC50 value of 8.0±1.8 μM, and that of apigenin was 18.6±1.6 μM. The irreversible fibrosis that defines CP is mediated by activated PSC, which produce and remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Erkan et al. 2012, Gut 61:172). Therefore, the potent antiproliferative effect of these new analogues on PSC supports their further development as anti-fibrotic agents for CP.
These two representative analogues were also investigated to determine whether the growth inhibition induced by compounds 23 and 24 in PSC was attributed to apoptosis. Apoptosis was determined using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS assay. This sandwich-enzyme-immunoassay involved antibodies binding to cytoplasmic nucleosomes, which were specific to the process of apoptosis rather than necrosis. Analogue 23 was found to be quite potent, inducing greater PSC cell death at lower concentrations than apigenin ( FIG. 3A ). At low concentrations, compound 24 failed to induce apoptosis; however, between the concentrations of 25-35 μM, it produced a steep dose-response curve, and concentrations beyond 35 μM induced significant cell death. Next, the dose-response curve was generated ( FIG. 3B ). The EC50 represented the concentration at which the compound yielded half of the maximal amount of cell death. The most potent analogue 23 exhibited the lowest EC50 value of 9.6±1.8 μM, while the EC50 value of apigenin was 24.5±2.5 μM, and that of 24 was 35.2±5.5 μM. The capacity of the compounds to induce cell death in activated PSC would most likely translate into reduced fibrosis in CP. Analogue 23 more potently induced PSC apoptosis than apigenin, while 24 appeared to act through a different cellular mechanism, inducing stellate cell toxicity at concentrations greater than 25 μM.
These results prompted the further testing of 23 and 24 as lead compounds for the development of a new series of anti-fibrotic agents that may be useful for treating CP (Apte 2011, Antioxid Redox Signal 15:2711). In order to evaluate the anti-fibrotic effect of these new compounds as a proof-of-concept, the compounds were tested in a preclinical animal model of CP. CP was induced in mice using the well-established model of repeated cerulean (CR) injections (Lerch and Gorelick 2013, Gastroenterology 144:1180; Aghdassi et al. 2011, Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair 4:26). Treatment with vehicle, apigenin or analogues (0.5 mg/kg daily gavage) was started the second week of the experiment and continued with CP induction. After four weeks, the pancreata were processed and stained for fibronectin, which is a major component of the ECM. The 400×microscope image in FIG. 4A showed a large amount of periacinar and perilobular fibrosis (brown color), edema (the space between lobules), and atrophic, irregularly shaped acini (Chao et al. 2005, J Surg Res 129:313). Treatment with apigenin and analogues 23 and 24 significantly decreased the stromal fibrosis of CP, reduced tissue edema, and limited acinar cell damage ( FIGS. 4B-4D ). ImageJ analysis of the slides quantified the significant decrease in fibrosis (p<0.001) ( FIG. 4E ). Despite no statistical difference between apigenin and compounds 23 or 24 at the low dose of 0.5 mg/kg, these data demonstrated that apigenin and new analogues significantly reduced fibrosis in the pre-clinical animal model of CP. Proof-of-concept studies are provided herein and demonstrate that apigenin and analogues have the potential to function as anti-fibrotic agents in CP.
Accumulating evidence suggests that activated PSC play an important role in CP. The inventors have contemplated a strategy for the prevention and treatment of CP by decreasing the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of PSC. While a few flavone-based compounds have previously been reported to possess antiproliferative effects for cancer, the inventors show that apigenin and its analogues suppress the proliferation of PSC and reduce the associated fibrosis. Chemical modifications of apigenin have been directed to build a focused library of O-alkylamino-tethered apigenin derivatives at 4′-O position of the ring C with the attempt to enhance the potency and drug-like properties including aqueous solubility. A series of novel apigenin analogues have been synthesized from the key intermediate 6, and a number of compounds such as 14, 16, and 24 have been identified to exhibit potent antiproliferative effects as well as improved aqueous solubility. Even at a low dose of 0.5 mg/kg apigenin, new analogues 23 and 24 significantly reduced the fibrotic response in a preclinical animal model of CP, providing a proof-of-concept study that supports their development as promising therapeutics for CP.

CP (50 μg CR/kg mouse weight) was administered via intraperitoneal route hourly for 5 h for 3 d/week for a total of 4 weeks. Control mice received phosphate buffered saline (PBS) injections following the same schedule. Starting Week 2 of the experiment, apigenin, analogue, or vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose+0.025% Tween 20 in ddH2O) were administered (0.5 mg/kg/d, oral gavage, once daily, 6 d/week, for 3 week) while continuing CR injections. At the end of Week 4, the mice were anesthestized with isoflurane and sacrificed per protocol. The pancreata were quickly harvested and processed.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and image analysis. Pancreata were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Prior to staining, sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized with xylene, dehydrated with ethanol, and subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval (DAKO, Carpinteria, Calif.) to optimize antigen immunoreactivity. Fibronectin antibody (1:600; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Tex.), and biotinylated anti-goat IgG (1:400; Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, Calif.) were used. IHC staining was completed with the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit (Vector Lab), color development with DAB (DAKO), and counterstaining with hematoxylin 7211 (Thermo Scientific, Kalamazoo, Mich.). Five non-overlapping images of each pancreas (400×) were taken using an Olympus BX51 microscope connected to a DP71 Olympus digital camera. The percent area of brown fibronectin staining was quantified using the Image Processing and Analysis in Java (ImageJ) 1.46r software (NIH, Bethesda, Md.) and a color deconvolution plug-in (Ruifrok and Johnston, Anal Quant Cytol Histol 2001, 23:291; Schneider et al., Nat Methods 2012, 9:671).
Statistical analysis. Dose-response curves were generated by plotting fluorescence or absorbance versus log (compound concentration). A best-fit curve was created using nonlinear regression, and the IC50 or EC50 determined from the graph (GraphPad Prism 5; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, Calif.). To analyze continuos variables, unpaired student t-tests and one-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons post-test (GraphPad Prism 5). Significance was set at p<0.05.
Recombinant human CBS protein expression and purification. The expression and purification of human CBS was performed as described previously (Asimakopoulou et al. 2013, Br J Pharmacol. 169(4):922-32). Briefly, E. Coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif., USA) containing the expression vector pGEX-Kg/GST-CBS were grown at 37° C. and 180 rpm in LuriaBertani (LB) broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an absorption of 0.6-0.8 at 600 nm. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and cells were further incubated at 30° C. overnight. The bacteria were harvested and sonicated in lysis buffer PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.8) containing a protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma). The protein lysate was loaded onto a GSTrap FF 1 ml affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) and the GST-CBS recombinant protein was eluted with the elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) and then dialyzed and concentrated in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.2) and DTT (1 mM).
Measurement of H2S production by recombinant CBS. The measurement of H2S production by recombinant CBS enzyme was performed as described (Asimakopoulou et al. 2013, Br J Pharmacol. 169(4):922-32). Briefly, each test consisted of a 100 μl reaction mixture in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.2 containing 1 μg of the purified human CBS enzyme, 0.01 mM pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP), 10 mM L-cysteine and 0.5 mM homocysteine. Apigenin or its various analogs (100 μM) was added to the reaction 15 min before the addition of L-cysteine/homocysteine to the solution. The reaction was initiated by transferring the Eppendorf tubes from ice to a 37° C. shaking water bath. After 60 minutes of incubation at 37° C., the reaction was terminated by adding 1% ZnAc followed by 10% trichloroacetic acid. Subsequently, N,N-dimethylphenylendiamine sulfate (20 mM in 7.2 M HCl) and FeCl3 (30 mM in 1.2 M HCl) were added and the optical absorbance of the solutions was measured at 650 nm. All samples were assayed in triplicate and the effect of the various test compounds on H2S production was expressed as % of control (in the absence of apigenin or its analogs), which was considered 100%.
