A potential side product in the synthesis of the compounds of the formula I is the enantiomer of the compound of formula (I), i.e. compounds of formula (Iaa). The difference between the compounds of formula (I) and the compounds of formula (Iaa) is that the two carbon atoms bearing the B and the A-CO—NR2 groups each have their absolute stereochemistry formally inverted.
The racemic compound (II) is a 1:1 mixture of the compounds of formula (I) and (Iaa). In the compounds of formula (I), (Iaa) and (II) the groups B and the A-CO—NR2 are cis to each other on the four-membered ring. Wedged bonds shown for example in the compounds of formula (I) and (Iaa) represent absolute stereochemistry, whereas thick straight bonds such as those shown for the compounds of formula (II) represent relative stereochemistry in racemic compounds. This applies throughout.
The compound of formula (XXXIII) below is the trans isomer of compound of formula (II), wherein B and A-CO—NR2 are trans to each other on the four-membered ring. This can also be formed as side products in the synthesis of compounds of the formula (II).
The compound of formula (XXXIII) also displays some pesticidal activity, in particular nematicidal and fungicidal activity.
According to the invention, in compositions comprising both the compound of formula (I) and the compound of formula (Iaa), the ratio of the compound of formula (I) to its enantiomer (the compound of formula (Iaa)) must be greater than 1:1. Preferably, the ratio of the compound of formula (I) to the compound of formula (Iaa) is greater than 1.5:1, more preferably greater than 2.5:1, especially greater than 4:1, advantageously greater than 9:1, desirably greater than 20:1, in particular greater than 35:1. This also applies to each relevant intermediate described herein therefor and the relevant enantiomer.
Mixtures containing up to 50%, preferably up to 40%, more preferably up to 30%, especially up to 20%, advantageously up to 10%, desirably up to 5%, in particular up to 3%, of the trans isomer are understood to be also part of this invention, such as any one of compounds of formula (I) and each relevant intermediate described herein therefor.
Preferably, the ratio of the compound of formula (I) to its trans isomer is greater than 1.5:1, more preferably greater than 2.5:1, especially greater than 4:1, advantageously greater than 9:1, desirably greater than 20:1, in particular greater than 35:1.
Preferably, in a composition comprising the compound of formula (I), its trans isomer (i.e. wherein the B and the A-CO—NR2 groups are trans to each other) and the compound of formula (Iaa), the composition comprises the compound of formula (I) in a concentration of at least 50%, more preferably 70%, even more preferably 85%, in particular over 92%, and particularly preferably over 97%, each based on the total amount of compound of formula (I), its trans isomer and the compound of formula (Iaa). It is particularly preferred that the mixture is at least 99% of the compound of formula (I) based on the total amount of compound of formula (I), its trans isomer and the compound of formula (Iaa).
It is possible that compounds of the formula (I) have further stereochemical centres in one of the substituents. Further isomers are then possible. The invention covers all such isomers and mixtures thereof.
The compounds of the formula (I) may occur in different tautomeric forms. The invention covers all those tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof.

Step (oo)
Compounds of the formula (XXX) can be prepared by reduction of the ketone group of compounds of formula (XXXIV) with a suitable reducing agent, such as for example sodium borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride.
Step (pp)
Compounds of the formula (XXXIV) can be accessed from compounds of formula (XXXI) by deprotection of one Prot″ group. For example when Prot″ is an amide, it can be removed by adding for example when R17 represents hydrogen, an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at the end of the reaction. If sodium hydroxide was chosen as the base for cyclisation, this step can be carried out together with step (qq) in a one-pot procedure. Using an excess of sodium hydroxide ensures that material deprotected prior the cyclisation is further transformed in compounds of formula (XXXIV).

The base can also be an excess of (R17CO)2N-M.
If sodium hydroxide is chosen as the base for cyclisation, step (pp) can be carried out together with step (qq) in a one-pot procedure. Using an excess of sodium hydroxide ensures that material deprotected prior the cyclisation is further transformed in compounds of formula (XXXIV).

HeterocycL Chem. 1997, 34, 469-476], by Grignard additions onto Weinreb's amide such as described in [Pablo, O.; Guijarro, D.; Yus, M. J. Org. Chem. 2013, 78, 9181-9189]) by treatment with molecular bromine, in the presence of catalytic hydrobromic acid in acetic acid, in a suitable inert solvent such as halogenoalcanes. Examples of this methodology for bromination are described in [Boeckmann, K.; Stroech, K.; Dutzmann, S.; Reinecke, P.; DE3704261A1, Bayer A.-G., Fed. Rep. Ger. 1988; p. 10 pp.].

Compounds of the formula (XXXVIII) can be prepared by acylation of compounds of the formula (XXXVI) with an acylating agent of the formula (XXI), using methodology described above under step (i). The ratio of the cis- and trans-isomers of the compound of the formula (XXXVIII) does not matter in this step.

Step (tt)
Compounds of the formula (XXXVI) can be prepared by treating a compound of the formula (IV) with ammonia and cyanide. Ammonia and cyanide can be used in the form of their salts. An excess of acid can be advantageous.
For preparing all further compounds of the formula I functionalized according to the definitions of A, B, R1 and R2, there are a large number of suitable known standard methods, such as alkylation, halogenation, acylation, amidation, oximation, oxidation and reduction. The choice of the preparation methods which are suitable are depending on the properties (reactivity) of the substituents in the intermediates.
These reactions can be conveniently performed in a solvent.
These reactions can be conveniently performed at various temperatures.
These reactions can be conveniently performed in an inert atmosphere.
The reactants can be reacted in the presence of a base. Examples of suitable bases are alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydrides, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal amides, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal alkoxides, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal acetates, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonates, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal dialkylamides or alkali metal or alkaline earth metal alkylsilylamides, alkylamines, alkylenediamines, free or N-alkylated saturated or unsaturated cycloalkylamines, basic heterocycles, ammonium hydroxides and carbocyclic amines. Examples which may be mentioned are sodium hydroxide, sodium hydride, sodium amide, sodium methoxide, sodium acetate, sodium carbonate, potassium tert-butoxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium hydride, lithium diisopropylamide, potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, calcium hydride, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, triethylenediamine, cyclohexylamine, N-cyclohexyl-N,N-dimethylamine, N,N-diethylaniline, pyridine, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine, quinuclidine, N-methylmorpholine, benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU).
The reactants can be reacted with each other as such, i.e. without adding a solvent or diluent. In most cases, however, it is advantageous to add an inert solvent or diluent or a mixture of these. If the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base, bases which are employed in excess, such as triethylamine, pyridine, N-methylmorpholine or N,N-diethylaniline, may also act as solvents or diluents.
The reaction is advantageously carried out in a temperature range from approximately −80° C. to approximately +140° C., preferably from approximately −30° C. to approximately +100° C., in many cases in the range between ambient temperature and approximately +80° C.
A compound of formula (I) can be converted in a manner known per se into another compound of formula (I) by replacing one or more substituents of the starting compound of formula (I) in the customary manner by (an)other substituent(s) according to the invention.
Depending on the choice of the reaction conditions and starting materials which are suitable in each case, it is possible, for example, in one reaction step only to replace one substituent by another substituent according to the invention, or a plurality of substituents can be replaced by other substituents according to the invention in the same reaction step.
Salts of compounds of formula (I) can be prepared in a manner known per se. Thus, for example, acid addition salts of compounds of formula (I) are obtained by treatment with a suitable acid or a suitable ion exchanger reagent and salts with bases are obtained by treatment with a suitable base or with a suitable ion exchanger reagent. A salt is chosen depending on its tolerances for compound's use, such as agricultural or physiological tolerance.
Salts of compounds of formula (I) can be converted in the customary manner into the free compounds I, acid addition salts, for example, by treatment with a suitable basic compound or with a suitable ion exchanger reagent and salts with bases, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid or with a suitable ion exchanger reagent.
Salts of compounds of formula (I) can be converted in a manner known per se into other salts of compounds of formula (I), acid addition salts, for example, into other acid addition salts, for example by treatment of a salt of inorganic acid such as hydrochloride with a suitable metal salt such as a sodium, barium or silver salt, of an acid, for example with silver acetate, in a suitable solvent in which an inorganic salt which forms, for example silver chloride, is insoluble and thus precipitates from the reaction mixture.
Depending on the procedure or the reaction conditions, the compounds of formula (I), which have salt-forming properties can be obtained in free form or in the form of salts.
Diastereomer mixtures or racemate mixtures of compounds of formula (I), in free form or in salt form, which can be obtained depending on which starting materials and procedures have been chosen can be separated in a known manner into the pure diasteromers or racemates on the basis of the physicochemical differences of the components, for example by fractional crystallization, distillation and/or chromatography.
As has been discussed, substituents at R3, R4, R5, R6, R10, R11 and R12 may lead to other enantiomers and diasteromers being formed. These also form part of the invention.
Enantiomer mixtures, such as racemates, which can be obtained in a similar manner can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, for example by recrystallization from an optically active solvent, by chromatography on chiral adsorbents, for example high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on acetyl celulose, with the aid of suitable microorganisms, by cleavage with specific enzymes, via the formation of inclusion compounds, for example using chiral crown ethers, where only one enantiomer is complexed, or by conversion into diastereomeric salts, for example by reacting a basic end-product racemate with an optically active acid, such as a carboxylic acid, for example camphoric, tartaric or malic acid, or sulfonic acid, for example camphorsulfonic acid, and separating the diastereomer mixture which can be obtained in this manner, for example by fractional crystallization based on their differing solubilities, to give the diastereomers, from which the desired enantiomer can be set free by the action of suitable agents, for example basic agents.
Pure diastereomers or enantiomers can be obtained according to the invention not only by separating suitable isomer mixtures, but also by generally known methods of diastereoselective or enantioselective synthesis, for example by carrying out the process according to the invention with starting materials of a suitable stereochemistry.
N-oxides can be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula (I) with a suitable oxidizing agent, for example the H2O2/urea adduct in the presence of an acid anhydride, e.g. trifluoroacetic anhydride. Such oxidations are known from the literature, for example from J. Med. Chem., 32 (12), 2561-73, 1989 or WO 00/15615 or C. White, Science, vol 318, p. 783, 2007.
It can be advantageous to isolate or synthesize in each case the biologically more effective isomer, for example enantiomer or diastereomer, or isomer mixture, for example enantiomer mixture or diastereomer mixture, if the individual components have a different biological activity.
The compounds of formula (I) and, where appropriate, the tautomers thereof, in each case in free form or in salt form, can, if appropriate, also be obtained in the form of hydrates and/or include other solvents, for example those which may have been used for the crystallization of compounds which are present in solid form.
The compounds according to the invention can be used for controlling or destroying pests such as insects and/or fungi which occur in particular on plants, especially on useful plants and ornamentals in agriculture, in horticulture and in forests, or on organs, such as fruits, flowers, foliage, stalks, tubers, seeds or roots, of such plants, and in some cases even plant organs which are formed at a later point in time remain protected against these pests. The compounds of formula (I) according to the invention are preventively and/or curatively valuable active ingredients in the field of pest control, even at low rates of application, which can be used against pesticide resistant pests such as insects and fungi, which compounds of formula (I) have a very favorable biocidal spectrum and are well tolerated by warm-blooded species, fish and plants. Accordingly, the present invention also makes available a pesticidal composition comprising compounds of the invention, such as formula (I).
It has now been found that the compounds of formula I according to the invention have, for practical purposes, a very advantageous spectrum of activities for protecting animals and useful plants against attack and damage by nematodes. Accordingly, the present invention also makes available a nematicidal composition comprising compounds of the invention, such as formula (I).

The composition may also further comprise a fertilizer, a micronutrient donor or other preparations which influence the growth of plants as well as comprising a combination containing the compound of the invention with one or more other biologically active agents, such as bactericides, fungicides, nematocides, plant activators, acaricides, and insecticides.
Accordingly, the present invention also makes available a composition comprising a compound of the invention and an agronomicaly carrier and optionally one or more customary formulation auxiliaries.
The compositions are prepared in a manner known per se, in the absence of auxiliaries for example by grinding, screening and/or compressing a solid compound of the present invention and in the presence of at least one auxiliary for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the compound of the present invention with the auxiliary (auxiliaries). In the case of solid compounds of the invention, the grinding/milling of the compounds is to ensure specific particle size. These processes for the preparation of the compositions and the use of the compounds of the invention for the preparation of these compositions are also a subject of the invention.
Examples of compositions for use in agriculture are emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, microemulsions, oil dispersibles, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, spreadable pastes, dilute emulsions, soluble powders, dispersible powders, wettable powders, dusts, granules or encapsulations in polymeric substances, which comprise—at least—a compound according to the invention and the type of composition is to be selected to suit the intended aims and the prevailing circumstances.
Examples of suitable liquid carriers are unhydrogenated or partially hydrogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably the fractions C8 to C12 of alkylbenzenes, such as xylene mixtures, alkylated naphthalenes or tetrahydronaphthalene, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as paraffins or cyclohexane, alcohols such as ethanol, propanol or butanol, glycols and their ethers and esters such as propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol ether, ethylene glycol or ethylene glycol monomethyl ether or ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ketones, such as cyclohexanone, isophorone or diacetone alcohol, strongly polar solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolid-2-one, dimethyl sulfoxide or N,N-dimethylformamide, water, unepoxidized or epoxidized vegetable oils, such as unexpodized or epoxidized rapeseed, castor, coconut or soya oil, and silicone oils.
Examples of solid carriers which are used for example for dusts and dispersible powders are, as a rule, ground natural minerals such as calcite, talc, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. To improve the physical properties, it is also possible to add highly disperse silicas or highly disperse absorptive polymers. Suitable particulate adsorptive carriers for granules are porous types, such as pumice, brick grit, sepiolite or bentonite, and suitable non-sorptive carrier materials are calcite or sand. In addition, a large number of granulated materials of inorganic or organic nature can be used, in particular dolomite or comminuted plant residues.
Suitable surface-active compounds are, depending on the type of the active ingredient to be formulated, non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants or surfactant mixtures which have good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. The surfactants mentioned below are only to be considered as examples; a large number of further surfactants which are conventionally used in the art of formulation and suitable according to the invention are described in the relevant literature.
Suitable non-ionic surfactants are, especially, polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids or of alkyl phenols which may contain approximately 3 to approximately 30 glycol ether groups and approximately 8 to approximately 20 carbon atoms in the (cyclo)aliphatic hydrocarbon radical or approximately 6 to approximately 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety of the alkyl phenols. Also suitable are water-soluble polyethylene oxide adducts with polypropylene glycol, ethylenediaminopolypropylene glycol or alkyl polypropylene glycol having 1 to approximately 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain and approximately 20 to approximately 250 ethylene glycol ether groups and approximately 10 to approximately 100 propylene glycol ether groups.

Examples which may be mentioned are nonylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, castor oil polyglycol ether, polypropylene glycol/polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, polyethylene glycol or octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Also suitable are fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate.
The cationic surfactants are, especially, quarternary ammonium salts which generally have at least one alkyl radical of approximately 8 to approximately 22 C atoms as substituents and as further substituents (unhalogenated or halogenated) lower alkyl or hydroxyalkyl or benzyl radicals. The salts are preferably in the form of halides, methylsulfates or ethylsulfates. Examples are stearyltrimethylammonium chloride and benzylbis(2-chloroethyl)ethylammonium bromide.
Examples of suitable anionic surfactants are water-soluble soaps or water-soluble synthetic surface-active compounds. Examples of suitable soaps are the alkali, alkaline earth or (unsubstituted or substituted) ammonium salts of fatty acids having approximately 10 to approximately 22 C atoms, such as the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of natural fatty acid mixtures which are obtainable for example from coconut or tall oil; mention must also be made of the fatty acid methyl taurates. However, synthetic surfactants are used more frequently, in particular fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or alkylaryl sulfonates. As a rule, the fatty sulfonates and fatty sulfates are present as alkali, alkaline earth or (substituted or unsubstituted) ammonium salts and they generally have an alkyl radical of approximately 8 to approximately 22 C atoms, alkyl also to be understood as including the alkyl moiety of acyl radicals; examples which may be mentioned are the sodium or calcium salts of lignosulfonic acid, of the dodecylsulphuric ester or of a fatty alcohol sulfate mixture prepared from natural fatty acids. This group also includes the salts of the sulphuric esters and sulfonic acids of fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide adducts. The sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain 2 sulphonyl groups and a fatty acid radical of approximately 8 to approximately 22 C atoms. Examples of alkylarylsulfonates are the sodium, calcium or triethanolammonium salts of decylbenzenesulfonic acid, of dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid or of a naphthalenesulfonic acid/formaldehyde condensate. Also possible are, furthermore, suitable phosphates, such as salts of the phosphoric ester of a p-nonylphenol/(4-14)ethylene oxide adduct, or phospholipids.
As a rule, the compositions comprise 0.1 to 99%, especially 0.1 to 95%, of compound according to the present invention and 1 to 99.9%, especially 5 to 99.9%, of at least one solid or liquid carrier, it being possible as a rule for 0 to 25%, especially 0.1 to 20%, of the composition to be surfactants (% in each case meaning percent by weight). Whereas concentrated compositions tend to be preferred for commercial goods, the end consumer as a rule uses dilute compositions which have substantially lower concentrations of active ingredient.

Examples of formulation types suitable for tank-mix compositions are solutions, dilute emulsions, suspensions, or a mixture thereof, and dusts.
As with the nature of the formulations, the methods of application, such as foliar, drench, spraying, atomizing, dusting, scattering, coating or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances.
The tank-mix compositions are generally prepared by diluting with a solvent (for example, water) the one or more pre-mix compositions containing different pesticides, and optionally further auxiliaries.
Suitable carriers and adjuvants can be solid or liquid and are the substances ordinarily employed in formulation technology, e.g. natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilizers.
Generally, a tank-mix formulation for foliar or soil application comprises 0.1 to 20%, especially 0.1 to 15%, of the desired ingredients, and 99.9 to 80%, especially 99.9 to 85%, of a solid or liquid auxiliaries (including, for example, a solvent such as water), where the auxiliaries can be a surfactant in an amount of 0 to 20%, especially 0.1 to 15%, based on the tank-mix formulation.
Typically, a pre-mix formulation for foliar application comprises 0.1 to 99.9%, especially 1 to 95%, of the desired ingredients, and 99.9 to 0.1%, especially 99 to 5%, of a solid or liquid adjuvant (including, for example, a solvent such as water), where the auxiliaries can be a surfactant in an amount of 0 to 50%, especially 0.5 to 40%, based on the pre-mix formulation.
Normally, a tank-mix formulation for seed treatment application comprises 0.25 to 80%, especially 1 to 75%, of the desired ingredients, and 99.75 to 20%, especially 99 to 25%, of a solid or liquid auxiliaries (including, for example, a solvent such as water), where the auxiliaries can be a surfactant in an amount of 0 to 40%, especially 0.5 to 30%, based on the tank-mix formulation.

Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates (e.g., pre-mix composition (formulation)), the end user will normally employ dilute formulations (e.g., tank mix composition).
Preferred seed treatment pre-mix formulations are aqueous suspension concentrates. The formulation can be applied to the seeds using conventional treating techniques and machines, such as fluidized bed techniques, the roller mill method, rotostatic seed treaters, and drum coaters. Other methods, such as spouted beds may also be useful. The seeds may be presized before coating. After coating, the seeds are typically dried and then transferred to a sizing machine for sizing. Such procedures are known in the art. The compounds of the present invention are particularly suited for use in soil and seed treatment applications.

Examples of application methods for the compounds of the invention and compositions thereof, that is the methods of controlling pests in the agriculture, are spraying, atomizing, dusting, brushing on, dressing, scattering or pouring—which are to be selected to suit the intended aims of the prevailing circumstances.
One method of application in agriculture is application to the foliage of the plants (foliar application), it being possible to select frequency and rate of application to match the danger of infestation with the pest/fungi in question. Alternatively, the active ingredient can reach the plants via the root system (systemic action), by applying the compound to the locus of the plants, for example by application of a liquid composition of the compound into the soil (by drenching), or by applying a solid form of the compound in the form of granules to the soil (soil application). In the case of paddy rice plants, such granules can be metered into the flooded paddy-field. The application of the compounds of the present invention to the soil is a preferred application method.
Typical rates of application per hectare is generally 1 to 2000 g of active ingredient per hectare, in particular 10 to 1000 g/ha, preferably 10 to 600 g/ha, such as 50 to 300 g/ha.
The compounds of the invention and compositions thereof are also suitable for the protection of plant propagation material, for example seeds, such as fruit, tubers or kernels, or nursery plants, against pests of the abovementioned type. The propagation material can be treated with the compound prior to planting, for example seed can be treated prior to sowing. Alternatively, the compound can be applied to seed kernels (coating), either by soaking the kernels in a liquid composition or by applying a layer of a solid composition. It is also possible to apply the compositions when the propagation material is planted to the site of application, for example into the seed furrow during drilling. These treatment methods for plant propagation material and the plant propagation material thus treated are further subjects of the invention. Typical treatment rates would depend on the plant and pest/fungi to be controlled and are generally between 1 to 200 grams per 100 kg of seeds, preferably between 5 to 150 grams per 100 kg of seeds, such as between 10 to 100 grams per 100 kg of seeds. The application of the compounds of the present invention to seeds is a preferred application method.
The term seed embraces seeds and plant propagules of all kinds including but not limited to true seeds, seed pieces, suckers, corns, bulbs, fruit, tubers, grains, rhizomes, cuttings, cut shoots and the like and means in a preferred embodiment true seeds.
The present invention also comprises seeds coated or treated with or containing a compound of formula I. The term “coated or treated with and/or containing” generally signifies that the active ingredient is for the most part on the surface of the seed at the time of application, although a greater or lesser part of the ingredient may penetrate into the seed material, depending on the method of application. When the said seed product is (re)planted, it may absorb the active ingredient. In an embodiment, the present invention makes available a plant propagation material adhered thereto with a compound of formula (I). Further, it is hereby made available, a composition comprising a plant propagation material treated with a compound of formula (I).
Seed treatment comprises all suitable seed treatment techniques known in the art, such as seed dressing, seed coating, seed dusting, seed soaking and seed pelleting. The seed treatment application of the compound formula I, which is a preferred application method, can be carried out by any known methods, such as spraying or by dusting the seeds before sowing or during the sowing/planting of the seeds.
Suitable target plants are, in particular, cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize or sorghum; beet, such as sugar or fodder beet; fruit, for example pomaceous fruit, stone fruit or soft fruit, such as apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries or berries, for example strawberries, raspberries or blackberries; leguminous plants, such as beans, lentils, peas or soya; oil plants, such as oilseed rape, mustard, poppies, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor, cocoa or ground nuts; cucurbits, such as pumpkins, cucumbers or melons; fibre plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp or jute; citrus fruit, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruit or tangerines; vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes or bell peppers; Lauraceae, such as avocado, Cinnamonium or camphor; and also tobacco, nuts, coffee, eggplants, sugarcane, tea, pepper, grapevines, hops, the plantain family, latex plants and ornamentals (such as flowers, amd lawn grass or turf).
In an embodiment, the plant is selected from cereals, corn, soybean, rice, sugarcane, vegetables and oil plants.
The term “plant” is to be understood as including also plants which have been so transformed by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that they are capable of synthesising one or more selectively acting toxins, such as are known, for example, from toxin-producing bacteria, especially those of the genus Bacillus and also plants which have been selected or hybridised to preserve and/or attain a desired trait, such as insect, fungi and/or nematode resistance.
Toxins that can be expressed by such transgenic plants include, for example, insecticidal proteins from Bacillus cereus or Bacillus popilliae; or insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as δ-endotoxins, e.g. Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1F, Cry1Fa2, Cry2Ab, Cry3A, Cry3Bb1 or Cry9C, or vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip), e.g. Vip1, Vip2, Vip3 or Vip3A; or insecticidal proteins of bacteria colonising nematodes, for example Photorhabdus spp. or Xenorhabdus spp., such as Photorhabdus luminescens, Xenorhabdus nematophilus; toxins produced by animals, such as scorpion toxins, arachnid toxins, wasp toxins and other insect-specific neurotoxins; toxins produced by fungi, such as Streptomycetes toxins, plant lectins, such as pea lectins, barley lectins or snowdrop lectins; agglutinins; proteinase inhibitors, such as trypsin inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, patatin, cystatin, papain inhibitors; ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), such as ricin, maize-RIP, abrin, luffin, saporin or bryodin; steroid metabolism enzymes, such as 3-hydroxysteroidoxidase, ecdysteroid-UDP-glycosyl-transferase, cholesterol oxidases, ecdysone inhibitors, HMG-COA-reductase, ion channel blockers, such as blockers of sodium or calcium channels, juvenile hormone esterase, diuretic hormone receptors, stilbene synthase, bibenzyl synthase, chitinases and glucanases.
In the context of the present invention there are to be understood by δ-endotoxins, for example Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1F, Cry1 Fa2, Cry2Ab, Cry3A, Cry3Bb1 or Cry9C, or vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip), for example Vip1, Vip2, Vip3 or Vip3A, expressly also hybrid toxins, truncated toxins and modified toxins. Hybrid toxins are produced recombinantly by a new combination of different domains of those proteins (see, for example, WO 02/15701). Truncated toxins, for example a truncated Cry1Ab, are known. In the case of modified toxins, one or more amino acids of the naturally occurring toxin are replaced. In such amino acid replacements, preferably non-naturally present protease recognition sequences are inserted into the toxin, such as, for example, in the case of Cry3A055, a cathepsin-G-recognition sequence is inserted into a Cry3A toxin (see WO 03/018810).
Examples of such toxins or transgenic plants capable of synthesising such toxins are disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0 374 753, WO 93/07278, WO 95/34656, EP-A-0 427 529, EP-A-451 878 and WO 03/052073.
The processes for the preparation of such transgenic plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the publications mentioned above. Cryl-type deoxyribonucleic acids and their preparation are known, for example, from WO 95/34656, EP-A-0 367 474, EP-A-0 401 979 and WO 90/13651.
The toxin contained in the transgenic plants imparts to the plants tolerance to harmful insects. Such insects can occur in any taxonomic group of insects, but are especially commonly found in the beetles (Coleoptera), two-winged insects (Diptera) and butterflies (Lepidoptera).
Transgenic plants containing one or more genes that code for an insecticidal resistance and express one or more toxins are known and some of them are commercially available. Examples of such plants are: YieldGard® (maize variety that expresses a Cry1Ab toxin); YieldGard Rootworm® (maize variety that expresses a Cry3Bb1 toxin); YieldGard Plus® (maize variety that expresses a Cry1Ab and a Cry3Bb1 toxin); Starlink® (maize variety that expresses a Cry9C toxin); Herculex I® (maize variety that expresses a Cry1Fa2 toxin and the enzyme phosphinothricine N-acetyltransferase (PAT) to achieve tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium); NuCOTN 33B® (cotton variety that expresses a Cry1Ac toxin); Bollgard I® (cotton variety that expresses a Cry1Ac toxin); Bollgard II® (cotton variety that expresses a Cry1Ac and a Cry2Ab toxin); VipCot® (cotton variety that expresses a Vip3A and a Cry1Ab toxin); NewLeaf® (potato variety that expresses a Cry3A toxin); NatureGard®, Agrisure® GT Advantage (GA21 glyphosate-tolerant trait), Agrisure® CB Advantage (Bt11 corn borer (CB) trait) and Protecta®.

Compounds of this invention are effective for controlling nematode, insect, acarid pests and/or fungal pathogens of agronomic plants, both growing and harvested, when employed alone, they may also be used in combination with other biological active agents used in agriculture, such as one or more nematicides, insecticides, acaricides, fungicides, bactericides, plant activator, molluscicide, and pheromones (whether chemical or biological). Mixing the compounds of the invention or the compositions thereof in the use form as pesticides with other pesticides frequently results in a broader pesticidal spectrum of action. For example, the formula (I) compounds of this invention may be used effectively in conjunction or combination with pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, macrolides, diamides, phosphates, carbamates, cyclodienes, formamidines, phenol tin compounds, chlorinated hydrocarbons, benzoylphenyl ureas, pyrroles and the like.
The activity of the compositions according to the invention can be broadened considerably, and adapted to prevailing circumstances, by adding, for example, one or more insecticidally, acaricidally, nematicidally and/or fungicidally active agents. The combinations compounds of formula (I) with other insecticidally, acaricidally, nematicidally and/or fungicidally active agents may also have further surprising advantages which can also be described, in a wider sense, as synergistic activity. For example, better tolerance by plants, reduced phytotoxicity, pests or fungi can be controlled in their different development stages or better behaviour during their production, for example during grinding or mixing, during their storage or during their use.
The following list of pesticides together with which the compounds according to the invention can be used, is intended to illustrate the possible combinations by way of example.

Biological Examples
Meloidogyne spp. (Root-Knot Nematode)
Nematicide, Contact Activity, Preventive.
Filter papers (9 cm×4.5 cm) with a small pocket were placed into plastic pouches (12 cm×6 cm). One cucumber cv. Toshka seed was placed in the centre of the filter paper pocket of all the pouches needed for a test. The cucumber seeds in the pouches were treated with test solutions at 200 ppm by pipetting the solution directly over the cucumber seed in the filter paper pocket in the pouch. Prior to application, the compound solution was prepared at twice the concentration required and the egg suspension is prepared with FORL nutrient solution with 3000 eggs/0.5 ml. After applying all the treatments, 3000 eggs (in 0.5 ml of FORL nutrient solution) were pipetted into the pouches. The pouches were incubated in a moist chamber for twelve days and watered regularly to maintain good filter paper moisture essential for the growing cucumber root system. After this period, the filter paper containing the germinated cucumber seedling was removed from the plastic pouch to assess the number of galls caused by Meloidogyne spp. per root system. Phytotoxicity was measured as a reduction of growth of the emerged cucumber seedling in comparison to the control.
The following compounds showed a greater than 80% reduction of galling compared to the untreated control:

Heterodera schachtii (Sugar Beet Cyst Nematode), Nematicide, Contact Activity
The tested application rate of each compound was 200 ppm. All solutions were brought to a concentration of 400 ppm, respectively, as they were subsequently diluted by adding the equivalent amount of water containing juvenile nematodes. After preparation of the suspensions, 1 ml of each suspension and concentration was transferred to 16-well assay plates with a total of three replicates per treatment. Approximately 500 juveniles of Heterodera schachtii were added in 1 ml of water to each well. Nematodes in water served as controls. The plates were placed in a dark box and stored at room temperature. Nematode paralysis was determined after 24 hours incubation at 25° C. in darkness. Nematodes that showed no movement were considered immotile.
