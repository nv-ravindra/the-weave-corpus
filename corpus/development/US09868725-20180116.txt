TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound which has a cholinergic muscarinic M1 receptor positive allosteric modulator activity and is useful as a medicament such as an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, pain, sleep disorder, Parkinson's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and the like. As used herein, the positive allosteric modulator activity refers to an action to potentiate receptor function by binding at a different site from that of an endogenous activator (acetylcholine for this receptor).
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that induces signal transduction in the central nervous system and the neuromuscular connections (the parasympathetic nerve and motor nerve). In the central nervous system, nuclei of origin of the acetylcholine neuron are in the brain stem and forebrain, and those acetylcholine neurons project to cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and limbic area. In addition, some interneurons in some brain areas such as striatum utilize acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. Acetylcholine receptor is classified into a ligand dependent-ion channel (cholinergic nicotinic receptor) and a G-protein-coupled receptor (cholinergic muscarinic receptor). The cholinergic muscarinic receptor is one kind of receptor for excitatory neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, and was named based on the selective activation of the receptor by muscarine. The muscarinic receptor is further classified into subtypes of M1 to M5. The M1 receptor is known to be mainly distributed in the brain, and deeply involved particularly in learning, memory, sleep, neuropathic pain, and the like. The importance of cholinergic muscarinic M1 receptor in brain physiology is well known, and a compound which enhances M1 receptor function is expected to be useful as an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of mental diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, memory disorders, pain, sleep disorders, Parkinson's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and the like (non-patent document 1).

1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum) was measured by Fourier-transform NMR. For the analysis, ACD/SpecManager (trade name) and the like were used. Peaks with very mild protons such as a hydroxy group, an amino group m and the like are not sometimes described.
MS (mass spectrum) was measured by LC/MS (liquid chromatography mass spectrometer). As Ionization, ESI (Electro Spray Ionization) method, or APCI (Atomospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization) method was used. The data indicates those actual measured value (found). Generally, molecular ion peaks are observed. In the case of a compound having a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (-Boc), a peak after elimination of a tert-butoxycarbonyl group or tert-butyl group may be observed as a fragment ion. In the case of a compound having a hydroxy group (—OH), a peak after elimination of H2O may be observed as a fragment ion. In the case of a salt, a molecular ion peak or fragment ion peak of free form is generally observed.

Experimental Example 1
Measurement of M1 Receptor Positive Allosteric Modulator (M1PAM) Activity
The activity of a test compound in the presence of acetylcholine at EC20 concentration (final concentration 0.6-0.8 nM), which affords an action corresponding to about 20% of the maximum activity, was measured as PAM activity. The method is as follows. CHO-K1 cells stably expressing a human M1 receptor (hCHRM1) were plated on a 384-well black clear bottom plate (BD Falcon) at 5,000 cells/well, and cultured in an incubator at 37° C., 5% CO2 for 1 day. The medium in the cell plate was removed, and assay buffer A (Recording medium (DOJINDO LABORATORIES), 0.1% BSA (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), 2.5 μg/mL Fluo-4 AM (DOJINDO LABORATORIES), 0.08% Pluronic F127 (DOJINDO LABORATORIES), 1.25 mM probenecid (DOJINDO LABORATORIES)) containing a calcium indicator was added at 30 μL/well. The cells were left standing in the incubator at 37° C., 5% CO2 for 30 min, and further left standing at room temperature for 30 min. A test compound prepared by diluting with assay buffer B (HBSS (Invitrogen), 20 mM HEPES (Invitrogen), 0.1% BSA) containing 2.4-3.2 nM acetylcholine was added at 10 μL/well, and the fluorescence was measured by FLIPRtetra (Molecular Devices) for 1 min every 1 second. With the definition that the amount of change in the fluorescence on addition of acetylcholine (final concentration 1 μM) is 100% and that on addition of DMSO instead of a test compound is 0%, the activity (%) of the test compound was calculated, and the inflection point in the concentration-dependent curve of the test compound was calculated as IP values. The results are shown in Table 2.  TABLE 2

Experimental Example 2
Measurement of Myo-Inositol 1 Phosphate (IP1)
Animals used were male Long-Evans rats. They were used after acclimation for at least 1 week. Test compounds were suspended in 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose solution, and the suspension was orally administered to the rats. At a certain period of time after the oral administration, the solution prepared by dissolving lithium chloride in saline was subcutaneously administered into the rats. At a certain period of time after the subcutaneously administration, their bilateral hippocampi were isolated from the rats, and the wet weight thereof was measured. The hippocampi were homogenized with HEPES buffer, followed by centrifugation. The IP1 and protein concentrations in the supernatant were measured by IP-One HTRF assay kit (Cisbio Bioassays) and BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific), respectively. The level of the IP1 production was expressed as the ratio of the concentration of IP1 to that of protein. The increase rate of the IP1 production was shown as a relative value when Vehicle administration group as 100%. The results are shown in Table 3.  TABLE 3

Experimental Example 3
Novel Object Recognition Test
Novel object recognition test is comprised of two trials called the acquisition and the retention trials. Scopolamine-induced memory deficits models were used for the test, and animals used were male Long-Evans rats (7-week-old). On the day before the test, for acclimation, the rats were allowed to freely move about the test box (40×40×50 cm) for 10 minutes. On the test day, the rats were acclimated to the test room for about 1 hr prior to the test. The test compounds were orally administered to the rats in a single dose 2 hr before the acquisition trial. For induction of learning and memory deficits, scopolamine (0.1 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered into the rats 30 min before the acquisition trial. For the acquisition trial, two identical objects (A1, A2) were placed in the test box. The rats were put in the test box for 3 min, and the duration exploring each object was measured. The retention trial was performed 4 hr after the acquisition trial. For the retention trial, the familiar object (A3) used for the acquisition trial and the novel object (B) different shape from A3 were placed in the test box. The rats were put in the test box for 3 min. The duration exploring each object in the acquisition trial and the retention trial, and the exploration rate (%) of novel object was calculated. The exploration rate (%) of novel object was expressed as (the duration exploring the novel object)/[(the duration exploring the novel object)+(the duration exploring the familiar object)]×100(%) at mean±standard error. The results are shown below.
