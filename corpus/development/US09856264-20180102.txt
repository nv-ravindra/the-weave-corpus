FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to isoquinoline sulfonamide derivatives and its pharmaceutical composition as RHO inhibitors. To be specific, this invention relates to the compounds of formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as RHO inhibitors.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Fasudil, as a RHO kinase inhibitor, can smooth the blood vessel contraction through reducing the myosin light chain phosphorylation, reduce the tension of endothelial cells, improve the blood microcirculation in the brain, and prevent the occur or aggravation of steal syndrome. At the same time, Fasudil can antagonize the effect of proinflammatory cytokines, protect the neurons from diverse cell death, and promote nerve regeneration. There is evidence to support fasudil hydrochloride in promoting the nerve function recovery and reducing the proportion of disability in clinical. Due to the limited access to healthcare service and the level of awareness of the disease in China rural areas, the ultra early thrombolysis treatment cannot be achieved for most patients. For patients beyond the thrombolysis window, there are limited medical treatment options to reduce further progression of the disease and rebuild local blood circulation. Fasudil has effects on both aspects, and may offer significant neuroprotective and therapeutic effects on ischemic cerebrovascular disease. This study of Fasudil and its analogs may have significant clinical impact to reduce the disability rate and improve the quality of life for stroke patients.
WO2004106325 discloses a series of compounds of the general formula (B-I) belonging to fasudil prodrug.
In spite of these prior art compounds can be used as RHO kinase inhibitors, their activity, solubility, pharmacokinetics and other aspects of performance of the aforesaid compounds could be improved.

The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problems or complications, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is meant to include a salt of a compound of the invention which is prepared by a relatively nontoxic acid or base the compound of the invention having particular substituents. When the compound of the invention contains a relatively acidic functional group, a base addition salt can be obtained by contacting a neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of a desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include salts of sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amine, or magnesium, or similar salts. When the compound of the invention contains a relatively basic functional group, an acid addition salt can be obtained by contacting a neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of a desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include salts of inorganic acids including hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, hydrocarbonic, phosphoric, hydrophosphoric, dihydrophosphoric, sulfuric, hydrosulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like; as well as salts of organic acids including acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic acid, or the like; and also salts of amino acids (such as arginate and the like), and salts of organic acids like glucuronic acid and the like (see, Berge et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, Journal of Pharmaceutical Science 66: 1-19 (1977)). Certain specific compounds of the invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.
The neutral form of the compound is preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and then isolating the parent compounds in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms thereof in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.
As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to derivatives of the compounds of the invention wherein the parent compound is modified by making a salt with an acid or base. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. Such conventional non-toxic salts include, but are not limited to, those derived from inorganic and organic acids selected from 2-acetoxybenzoic, 2-hydroxyethane sulfonic, acetic, ascorbic, benzene sulfonic, benzoic, bicarbonic, carbonic, citric, edetic, ethane disulfonic, ethane sulfonic, fumaric, glucoheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydroiodide, hydroxyl acids hydroxynaphthoic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauryl sulfonic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methane sulfonic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phosphoric, polygalacturonic, propionic, salicyclic, stearic, subacetic, succinic, sulfamic, sulfanilic, sulfuric, tannic, tartaric, and toluene sulfonic acid.
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile or the like are preferred.
In addition to salt forms, the present invention provides compounds which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an in vivo environment.
Certain compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated forms or solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and all are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
Certain compounds of the invention may possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are all encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
The graphic representations of racemic, ambiscalemic and scalemic or enantiomerically pure compounds used herein are taken from Maehr, J. Chem. Ed. 1985, 62: 114-120. Solid and broken wedges are used to denote the absolute configuration of a stereocenter unless otherwise noted. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are included.
Compounds of the invention can exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, (−)- and (+)-enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, such as enantiomerically or diastereomerically enriched mixtures, and all these mixtures as falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms can be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention.
Optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers and D and L isomers can be prepared by chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or other conventional techniques. If, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired, it can be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivatization with a chiral auxiliary, where the resultant diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group is cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group (such as an amino group) or an acidic functional group (such as a carboxyl group) diastereomeric salts can be formed with an appropriate optically active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers by general means known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers. In addition, separation of enantiomers and diastereomers is frequently accomplished by chromatography employing chiral, stationary phases, optionally in combination with chemical derivatization (e.g., formation of carbamates from amines).
The compounds of the invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the invention, regardless of radioactivity or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle” refers to any formulation or carrier medium that is capable of delivery of an effective amount of an active agent of the invention without toxic side effects in a host or patient. Representative carriers include water, oils, both vegetable and mineral, cream bases, lotion bases, ointment bases and the like. These bases include suspending agents, thickeners, penetration enhancers, and the like. Their formulation is well known to those in the art of cosmetics and topical pharmaceuticals. Additional information concerning carriers can be found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2005) which is incorporated herein by reference.
The term “excipients” conventionally means carriers, diluents and/or vehicles needed in formulating defective pharmaceutical compositions.
The terms “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” for a drug or pharmacologically active agent refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the drug or agent to provide the desired effect. In the oral dosage forms of the present disclosure, an “effective amount” of an active agent of the composition refers to the amount of the active agent required to provide the desired effect when used in combination with the other active agent of the composition. The amount that is “effective” will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of a recipient, and also a particular active agent, and an appropriate effective amount in an individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.
The terms “active ingredient,” “therapeutic agent,” “active substance,” or “active agent” mean a chemical entity which can be effective in treating a targeted disorder, disease or condition.
The term “substituted”, means that any one or more hydrogens on a designated atom is replaced with a substituent including deuterium and a variant of hydrogen, provided that the designated atom's valency is normal, and that the substituted compound is stable. When a substituent is keto (i.e., ═O), it means that 2 hydrogen atoms are replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. The term “optionally substituted” means that the designated atom can be substituted or unsubstituted, and unless otherwise stated, the species and number of the substituents may be arbitrary provided that they can be achieved in Chemistry.
When any variable (e.g., R) occurs more than once in the constituent or structure of a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent. Thus, for example, if a group is substituted with 0-2 Rs, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R groups and R at each occurrence has independently options. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.
When a variable is selected from single bond, it indicates that the two radical groups connected with the single bond are linked directly, for an example, when L represents single bond, A-L-Z is A-Z actually.
When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating via which atom such substituent is bonded to the compound of a general formula including unspecified ones, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom therein. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.
Substituents of the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals are generically referred to as “alkyl group substituents” and they can be one or more selected from, but not limited to the following groups: —R′, —OR′, ═O, ═NR′, ═N—OR′, —NR′R″, —SR′, -halogen, —SiR′R″R″, OC(O)R′, —C(O)R′, —CO2R′, —CONR′R″, —OC(O)NR′R″, —NR″C(O)R′, NR′C(O)NR″R″, —NR″C(O)2R′, —NR′″″—C(NR′R″R′″)═NR″″, NR″″′C(NR′R″)═NR′″, —S(O)R′, —S(O)2R′, S(O)2NR′R″, NR″SO2R′, —CN, —NO2, —N3, —CH(Ph)2, and fluoro(C1-C4)alkyl, with a number of substitutents ranging from zero to (2m′+1), where m′ is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R′, R″, R′″, R″″′ and R″″′ are each preferably independently hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl (e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens), substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R″″ and R″″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R′ and R″ are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, —NR′R″ is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion on substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term “alkyl” is meant to include groups constituted by carbon atoms bonding to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., —CF3 and —CH2CF3) and acyl (e.g., —C(O)CH3, —C(O)CF3, —C(O)CH2OCH3, and the like).
Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents of the aryl and heteroaryl groups are generically referred to as “aryl group substituents.” The substituents are selected from, for example: —R′, —OR′, —NR′R″, —SR′, -halogen, —SiR′R″R″′, OC(O)R′, —C(O)R′, —CO2R′, —CONR′R″, —OC(O)NR′R″, —NR″C(O)R′, NR′C(O)NR″R″′, —NR″C(O)2R′, —NR″″′—C(NR′R″R″″)═NR″″, NR″″′C(NR′R″)═NR″′, —S(O)R′, —S(O)2R′, —S(O)2NR′R″, NR″SO2R′, —CN, —NO2, —N3, —CH(Ph)2, fluoro(C1-C4)alkoxy, and fluoro(C1-C4)alkyl, etc, with a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring; where R′, R″, R′″, R″″ and R″″′ are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R′″, R″″ and R″″′ groups when more than one of these groups is present.
Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -T-C(O)—(CRR′)q-U—, wherein T and U are independently selected from —NR—, —O—, —CRR′— or a single bond, and q is an integer from 0 to 3. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A(CH2)rB—, wherein A and B are independently selected from —CRR′—, —O—, —NR—, —S—, —S(O)—, S(O)2-, —S(O)2NR′— or a single bond, and r is an integer from 1 to 4. One of the single bonds of the thus formed new ring may optionally be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A(CH2)rB—, where s and d are separately and independently selected from integers from 0 to 3, and X is —O—, —NR′—, —S(O)—, —S(O)2-, or —S(O)2NR′—. The substituents R, R′, R″ and R′″ are separately, preferably and independently selected from hydrogen and substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C6)alkyl.
The term “halo” or “halogen,” by themselves or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, the term “haloalkyl,” are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term “halo(C1-C4)alkyl” is mean to include, but not be limited to, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.
Examples of haloalkyl include, but are not limited to, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, and pentachloroethyl. “Alkoxy” represents an alkyl group as defined above with the indicated number of carbon atoms attached through an oxygen bridge. C1-6 alkoxy is intended to include C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 alkoxy groups. Examples of alkoxy include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, i-propoxy, n-butoxy, s-butoxy, t-butoxy, n-pentoxy, and s-pentoxy. “Cycloalkyl” is intended to include saturated ring groups, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, or cyclopentyl. 3-7 cycloalkyl is intended to include C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 cycloalkyl groups. “Alkenyl” is intended to include hydrocarbon chains of either straight or branched configuration and one or more unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds that may occur in any stable point along the chain, such as ethenyl and propenyl.
The term “Halo” or “halogen” refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo.
As used herein, the term “hetero”, mean, unless otherwise stated, “heteroatom” or “heteroradical” (namely radical containing heteroatom), including atoms other than carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), also including the radicals containing these aforesaid heteroatoms. Examples include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) sulfur (S), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), aluminum (Al) and boron (B), also include optionally substituted —C(═O)N(H)—, —N(H)—, —C(═NH)—, —S(═O)2 N(H)—, or —S(═O)N(H)—.
“Ring or cyclo” means a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocycloalkenyl, cycloalkynyl, heterocycloalkynyl, aryl, or heteroaryl. The so-called ring includes mono, bi, spiro, fused, and bridged ring moieties. The number of atoms in a ring is typically defined as the number of members of the ring. For example, a “5- to 7-membered ring” means there are 5 to 7 atoms in the encircling arrangement. Unless otherwise specified, the ring optionally includes one to three heteroatoms. Thus, the term “5- to 7-membered ring” includes, for example phenyl, pyridinyl and piperidinyl. The term “5- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl ring”, on the other hand, include pyridinyl and piperidinyl, but not phenyl. The term “ring” further includes a ring system comprising at least one ring, wherein each “ring” is independently defined as above.
The term “heterocycle” or “heterocyclio” is intended to mean a stable monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic ring containing heteroatom or heteroradical, which may be saturated, partially unsaturated or unsaturated (aromatic), and include carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3, or 4 ring heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S in which any of the above-defined heterocyclic rings may be fused to a benzene ring to form a bicyclic group. The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (i.e., NO and S(O) p, p is 1 or 2). The nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR wherein R is H or other substituents, already defined herein). The heterocyclic ring may be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom that results in a stable structure. The heterocyclic rings described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resultant compound is stable. A nitrogen in the heterocycle may optionally be quaternized. In a preferred embodiment, when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. In another preferred embodiment the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1. As used herein, the term “aromatic heterocyclic group” or“heteroaryl” is intended to mean a stable 5-, 6-, or 7-membered monocyclic or bicyclic or 7-, 8-, 9-, or 10-membered bicyclic heterocyclic aromatic ring which includes carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3, or 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. The nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR wherein R is H or other substituents already defined herein). The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (i.e., NO and S(O) p, p is 1 or 2). It is to be noted that total number of S and O atoms in the aromatic heterocycle is not more than 1. Bridged rings are also included in the definition of heterocycle. A bridged ring occurs when one or more atoms (i.e., C, O, N, or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms. Preferred bridged rings include, but are not limited to, one carbon atom, two carbon atoms, one nitrogen atom, two nitrogen atoms, and a carbon-nitrogen group. It is to be noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. In a bridged ring, the substituents on the ring may also be present on the bridge.
