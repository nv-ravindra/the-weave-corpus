TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a 1-octene composition which is prepared by ethylene oligomerization and comprises a high content of 1-octene and monomers useful for copolymerization of 1-octene at the same time.
BACKGROUND OF ART
Linear alpha-olefin is widely used in important commercial substances such as comonomers, detergents, lubricants, plasticizers or the like, and in particular, 1-hexene and 1-octene are commonly used as comonomers for controlling density of polyethylene during preparation of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE).
In the conventional preparation process of LLDPE (Linear Low-Density Polyethylene), copolymerization of ethylene with alpha-olefin, for example, a comonomer such as 1-hexene and 1-octene is carried out in order to control density by forming branches in the polymer backbone.
Therefore, there is a problem that the production cost of LLDPE having a high content of comonomers is high. Various methods have been tried to solve this problem.
Further, because the application field or market size depends on the type of alpha-olefin, a technique capable of selectively producing a particular olefin is commercially important. Recently, many studies have been conducted on chromium catalysts for preparing 1-hexene or 1-octene with a high selectivity through selective ethylene oligomerization.
The conventional commercial methods for preparation of 1-hexene or 1-octene are the SHOP process of Shell Chemical, and the Ziegler Process of Chevron Philips, which are used to produce alpha-olefins with a wide distribution ranging from 4 to 20 carbons.
A chromium-based catalyst for ethylene trimerization having a ligand of the formula (R1)(R2)X—Y—X(R3)(R4) has been suggested, in which X is phosphorus, arsenic or antimony, Y is a linking group such as —N(R5)-, and at least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 has a polar substituent or an electron donating substituent.
Further, studies have been conducted on (o-ethylphenyl)2PN(Me)P(o-ethylphenyl)2 as a ligand which shows no catalytic activity for 1-hexene under catalytic conditions and has no polar substituent in at least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 (Chem. Commun., 2002, 858).
However, the prior ligands containing heteroatoms as described above are still required to maintain their polymerization activity consistently during reactions for producing 1-octene or 1-hexene and to have high selectivity.
Meanwhile, it is required to minimize production of by-products other than 1-octene to obtain pure 1-octene upon preparation of 1-octene by olefin oligomerization. However, production of by-products other than 1-octene is unavoidable in practice. Since the kind and content of by-products vary depending on the oligomerization catalyst, catalysts with high 1-octene selectivity must be used. However, some by-products may be incorporated in the polyolefin during polymerization and may result in improvement of physical properties. In this case, there is no need of removing by-products during purification of oligomerization products.
Accordingly, the present inventors have studied various catalyst systems for olefin oligomerization, and found that a catalyst system for olefin oligomerization as described below is used to improve 1-octene selectivity and to produce by-products capable of improving physical properties of polyolefins when 1-octene is used as a comonomer in the preparation of polyolefins, thereby completing the present invention.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Technical Problem
The present invention provides a 1-octene composition which is prepared by ethylene oligomerization and comprises a high content of 1-octene and monomers useful for copolymerization of 1-octene at the same time.
Further, the present invention provides a catalyst system for ethylene oligomerization, which is used to prepare the 1-octene composition.
Technical Solution
In order to solve the above objects, the present invention provides a 1-octene composition comprising 90% by weight or more of 1-octene and 0.01 to 10% by weight of three or more of compounds represented by the following Chemical Formulae 1 to 4:
Preferably, the 1-octene composition according to the present invention comprises 0.1 to 1% by weight of three or more of the compounds represented by Chemical Formulae 1 to 4.
The 1-octene composition according to the present invention may be prepared by a method comprising the step of multimerizing ethylene in the presence of a catalyst system for olefin oligomerization, the catalyst system comprising a ligand compound, a transition metal source, and a cocatalyst.
As used herein, the term ‘olefin oligomerization’ means polymerization of a small number of olefins. When three olefins are polymerized, it is referred to as trimerization. When four olefins are polymerized, it is referred to as tetramerization. The process of polymerizing a small number of olefins to form a low molecular weight material is generally referred to as multimerization. Particularly, in the present invention, the olefin oligomerization means selective preparation of 1-octene, as a main comonomer of LLDPE, from ethylene.
Selective olefin oligomerization is closely related to a catalyst system used. A catalyst system used for olefin oligomerization comprises a transition metal source which functions as a main catalyst, and a cocatalyst, in which the structure of the active catalyst may be changed according to the chemical structure of the ligand, thereby varying olefin selectivity and catalytic activity as well as the kind and content of by-products.
Particularly, in the present invention, the catalyst system for olefin oligomerization described below is used, thereby preparing any one of the compounds represented by Chemical Formulae 1 to 4 as a by-product. Further, a product comprising an alpha-olefin mixture and a solvent, which is prepared by using the catalyst system for olefin oligomerization, may be applied to a proper distillation column to separate a C8 liquid composition having a boiling point of 110 to 140° C. at atmospheric pressure. In particular, the product prepared by using the catalyst system according to the present invention has very high selectivity for 1-octene in the C8 composition, i.e., 90% by weight or more. Preferably, the 1-octene composition according to the present invention comprises 99% by weight or more of 1-octene.
Preferably, the 1-octene composition according to the present invention also comprises all of the compounds represented by Chemical Formulae 1 to 4.
According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the 1-octene composition according to the present invention comprises 99% by weight or more of 1-octene and less than 1% by weight of the compounds represented by Chemical Formulae 1 to 4, and therefore, the composition may have high 1-octene selectivity and comprise by-products useful for polyethylene polymerization.
The ligand compound of the catalyst system for olefin oligomerization comprises two or more of a group represented by the following Chemical Formula 5 in the molecule, in which the two or more of the group are linked via four carbon atoms by a group selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an alicyclic group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, and an aromatic group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms:
wherein R1 to R4 are each independently C1-20 alkyl, C2-20 alkenyl, C6-20 aryl, C7-20 arylalkyl, C7-20 alkylaryl, or C7-20 alkoxyaryl.
The ligand compound comprises two or more diphosphinoamine functional groups, which are linked to each other via four carbon atoms. A group linking the diphosphinoamine functional groups is a group selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an alicyclic group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, and an aromatic group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Due to such structural feature, the ligand compound may exhibit high oligomerization activity when applied to the catalyst system for olefin oligomerization.
Further, there is no theoretical limitation, but a unique interaction occurs between adjacent chromium active sites, due to the structural feature of the ligand compound, leading to partial production of methylenecyclopentane during oligomerization. In turn, this compound is reacted with ethylene to produce the compounds of Chemical Formulae 1 to 4.
Preferably, the group linking the two or more groups via four carbon atoms is selected from the group consisting of the following Chemical Formulae:
wherein * is a region binding with N of Chemical Formula 1,
Ra is each independently hydrogen, or C1-5 alkyl,
m is an integer of 1 to 5,
n is an integer of 1 to 6, and
a plurality of Ra binding to one ring may be the same as or different from each other.
Preferably, R1 to R4 of Chemical Formula 5 are phenyl.
Representative examples of the ligand compound are as follows:
Another example of the ligand compound to achieve the above objects may be a ligand compound represented by the following Chemical Formula 6.
wherein R5 to R8 are each independently C6-20 aryl, or C7-20 alkylaryl,
R9 and R10 are each independently C1-20 alkyl, with the proviso that R9 and R10 are not the same as each other,
R11 to R13 are each independently hydrogen, C1-20 alkyl, C2-20 alkenyl, C7-20 arylalkyl, C7-20 arylalkenyl, C3-20 cycloalkyl, C3-20 cycloalkenyl, C9-20 arylcycloalkyl, C9-20 arylcycloalkenyl, C6-20 aryl, or C7-20 alkylaryl.
Preferably, R5 to R8 are phenyl, or 3,5-dimethylphenyl.
Preferably, R9 is methyl, and R10 is ethyl.
Preferably, R11 to R13 are hydrogen.
Representative examples of the compound represented by Chemical Formula 6 are as follows:
According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the catalyst system for olefin oligomerization according to the present invention was used to multimerize ethylene, the compounds of Chemical Formulae 1 to 4 were detected in the 1-octene composition as a product.
Further, when 1-octene is used as a comonomer of a polyethylene copolymer, a part of the compounds of Chemical Formulae 1 to 4 may act in copolymerization, together with 1-octene, because they have double bonds at their ends. In general, physical properties of an ethylene/1-octene copolymer may be improved by partially modifying the structure of the polymer through another comonomer, in addition to the comonomer content. Therefore, when the 1-octene composition according to the present invention is used as a monomer of the copolymer, physical properties of the polymer may be improved by the compounds of Chemical Formulae 1 to 4 which are included in the 1-octene composition. On the contrary, internal octenes (e.g., cis and trans isomers of 2-octene, 3-octene, 4-octene) as another type of by-products of the 1-octene composition hardly act in copolymerization due to their steric hindrance.
Meanwhile, in the catalyst system for olefin oligomerization according to the present invention, a transition metal source functions as a main catalyst, and it may be any one or more selected from the group consisting of chromium(III)acetylacetonoate, tris(tetrahydrofuran)chromium trichloride, chromium(III)-2-ethylhexanoate, chromium(III)tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate), chromium(III)benzoylacetonate, chromium(III)hexafluoro-2,4-pentanedionate, and chromium(III)acetate hydroxide.
Further, in the catalyst system for olefin oligomerization, the cocatalyst may be one or more selected from the group consisting of compounds represented by the following Chemical Formulae 7 to 9:
