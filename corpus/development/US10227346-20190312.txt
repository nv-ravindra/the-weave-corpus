BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Retinoid-related orphan receptors (ROR) are reported to have an important role in numerous biological processes. Scientific investigations relating to each of retinoid-related orphan receptors RORα, RORβ, and RORγ have been described in the literature. Continuing research in this field is spurred by the promise of developing new therapeutic agents to treat medical disorders associated with retinoid-related orphan receptor activity.
RORγ has been reported to be expressed in high concentration in various tissues, such as thymus, kidney, liver, muscle, and certain fat tissue. Two isoforms of RORγ have been identified and are referred to as γ1 and γ2 (also referred to as RORγt). Expression of the γ2 isoform has been reported to appear in, for example, double-positive thymocytes. Compounds capable of modulating RORyt activity are contemplated to provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of multiple medical disorders, including immune and inflammatory disorders.
Numerous immune and inflammatory disorders continue to afflict millions of patients worldwide. Significant advances have been made in treating these disorders. However, current therapies do not provide satisfactory results for all patients due to, for example, detrimental side effects or insufficient efficacy. Treatments for immune and inflammatory disorders vary depending on the particular medical disorder, and often involve use of immunosuppressive drugs. Surgery (e.g., splenectomy), plasmapheresis, or radiation can be used in certain instances.
One exemplary immune disorder in need of better therapy is psoriasis. Psoriasis is a T cell-mediated inflammatory disease that affects approximately 2% to 3% of adults and has a substantial adverse impact on the quality of life for patients suffering from this disorder. Plaques resulting from psoriasis can be painful and are visually unappealing. Various therapeutics have been developed in an attempt to treat psoriasis. However, the traditional therapies for psoriasis often have toxic adverse effects. Accordingly, a need exists for improved treatments for psoriasis as well as other immune and inflammatory disorders.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The invention provides compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of modulating RORγ activity and/or reducing the amount of IL-17 in a subject, and therapeutic uses of said compounds and pharmaceutical compositions. The practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of organic chemistry, pharmacology, molecular biology (including recombinant techniques), cell biology, biochemistry, and immunology. Such techniques are explained in the literature, such as in “Comprehensive Organic Synthesis” (B. M. Trost & I. Fleming, eds., 1991-1992); “Handbook of experimental immunology” (D. M. Weir & C. C. Blackwell, eds.); “Current protocols in molecular biology” (F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., 1987, and periodic updates); and “Current protocols in immunology” (J. E. Coligan et al., eds., 1991), each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
Various aspects of the invention are set forth below in sections; however, aspects of the invention described in one particular section are not to be limited to any particular section. Further, when a variable is not accompanied by a definition, the previous definition of the variable controls.
It is to be understood that the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of any subject matter claimed. In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In this application, the use of “or” means “and/or” unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, use of the term “including” as well as other forms, such as “include”, “includes,” and “included,” is not limiting.
It is to be understood that the methods and compositions described herein are not limited to the particular methodology, protocols, cell lines, constructs, and reagents described herein and as such may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the methods and compositions described herein, which will be limited only by the appended claims.
All publications and patents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the constructs and methodologies that are described in the publications, which might be used in connection with the methods, compositions and compounds described herein.
Chemical names, common names, and chemical structures may be used interchangeably to describe the same structure. If a chemical compound is referred to using both a chemical structure and a chemical name, and an ambiguity exists between the structure and the name, the structure predominates.
Definitions
“ROR” stands for Retinoic acid receptor-related Orphan Receptor. There are three forms of ROR, ROR-α, -β, and -γ and each is encoded by a separate gene (RORA, RORB, and RORC respectively). There are two subtypes of RORC: 1 and 2. Subtype 2 is also called “t”. The human RORC gene is also called TOR; RORG; RZRG; NRIF3; and RZR-GAMMA. The human protein RORC is also called nuclear receptor ROR-gamma; nuclear receptor RZR-gamma; retinoic acid-binding receptor gamma; retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma; RAR-related orphan receptor C, isoform a; RAR-related orphan nuclear receptor variant 2; nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group F member 3. As used herein, “RORγ” and “RORC2” are used interchangeably to refer to a protein from a RORC subtype 2 gene.
As used herein, the term “modulator” refers to a compound that alters an activity of a molecule. For example, a modulator can cause an increase or decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity of a molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity in the absence of the modulator. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an inhibitor, which decreases the magnitude of one or more activities of a molecule. In certain embodiments, an inhibitor completely prevents one or more activities of a molecule. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an activator, which increases the magnitude of at least one activity of a molecule. In certain embodiments the presence of a modulator results in an activity that does not occur in the absence of the modulator.
The term “alkyl” refers to a substituent obtained by removing a hydrogen from a saturated, straight (i.e. unbranched) or branched carbon chain (or carbon), or combination thereof, which has the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. C1-C6 means one to six carbons). Examples of alkyl substituents include methyl, ethyl, propyl (including n-propyl and isopropyl), butyl (including n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl), pentyl, isoamyl, hexyl and the like.
The term “haloalkyl” is an alkyl in which at least one hydrogen on the alkyl is replaced with a halogen atom. In certain embodiments in which two or more hydrogen atoms are replaced with halogen atoms, the halogen atoms are all the same as one another. In other embodiments in which two or more hydrogen atoms are replaced with halogen atoms, the halogen atoms are not all the same as one another.
The term “cycloalkyl” refers to a substituent obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from a saturated carbocycle having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. C3-C8 means three to eight carbons). Cycloalkyl refers to both a radical of a single ring saturated carbocycle, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. as well as a radical of a two or three ring bridged, fused or spiro saturated carbocycle, such as bicyclo[4.2.0]octane and decalinyl.
This specification uses the terms “substituent,” “radical,” and “group” interchangeably.
If a group of substituents are collectively described as being optionally substituted by one or more of a list of substituents, the group may include: (1) unsubstitutable substituents, (2) substitutable substituents that are not substituted by the optional substituents, and/or (3) substitutable substituents that are substituted by one or more of the optional substituents.
If a substituent is described such that it “may be substituted” or as being “optionally substituted” with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen substituents, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen substituents or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen substituents, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen substituents as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen substituent. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen substituents, then the nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen substituents if the amino nitrogen is a primary nitrogen, whereas the amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen substituent if the amino nitrogen is a secondary nitrogen.
As used herein compounds of Formula I may be referred to as a “compound(s) of the invention.” Such terms are also defined to include all forms of the Formula I including hydrates, solvates, isomers, crystalline and non-crystalline forms, isomorphs, polymorphs, and metabolites thereof. For example, the compounds of Formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.
A “metabolite” of a compound disclosed herein is a derivative of that compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “active metabolite” refers to a biologically active derivative of a compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “metabolized,” as used herein, refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes, such as, oxidation reactions) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Thus, enzymes may produce specific structural alterations to a compound. For example, cytochrome P450 catalyzes a variety of oxidative and reductive reactions while uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferases catalyze the transfer of an activated glucuronic-acid molecule to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and free sulfhydryl groups. Further information on metabolism may be obtained from The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Edition, McGraw-Hill (1996). Metabolites of the compounds disclosed herein can be identified either by administration of compounds to a host and analysis of tissue samples from the host, or by incubation of compounds with hepatic cells in vitro and analysis of the resulting compounds. Both methods are well known in the art. In some embodiments, metabolites of a compound are formed by oxidative processes and correspond to the corresponding hydroxy-containing compound. In some embodiments, a compound is metabolized to pharmacologically active metabolites.
In some embodiments, compounds described herein could be prepared as prodrugs. A “prodrug” refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, those of skill in this art, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, can design prodrugs of the compound. (see, for example, Nogrady (1985) Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392; Silverman (1992), The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pages 352-401, Saulnier et al., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985).
Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the herein-described compounds may be a prodrug for another derivative or active compound.
Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See, e.g., Fedorak et al., Am. J. Physiol., 269:G210-218 (1995); McLoed et al., Gastroenterol, 106:405-413 (1994); Hochhaus et al., Biomed. Chrom., 6:283-286 (1992); J. Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Int. J. Pharmaceutics, 37, 87 (1987); J. Larsen et al., Int. J. Pharmaceutics, 47, 103 (1988); Sinkula et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 64:181-210 (1975); T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; and Edward B. Roche, Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, all incorporated herein in their entirety.
The compounds of the invention may have asymmetric carbon atoms. The carbon-carbon bonds of the compounds of the invention may be depicted herein using a solid line, a solid wedge or a dotted wedge. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers (e.g. specific enantiomers, racemic mixtures, etc.) at that carbon atom are included. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. It is possible that compounds of the invention may contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds, the use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included. For example, unless stated otherwise, it is intended that the compounds of the invention can exist as enantiomers and diastereomers or as racemates and mixtures thereof. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in a compound of the invention and the use of a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to other asymmetric carbon atoms in the same compound is meant to indicate that a mixture of diastereomers is present.
Stereoisomers of compounds of the invention include cis and trans isomers, optical isomers such as R and S enantiomers, diastereomers, geometric isomers, rotational isomers, conformational isomers, and tautomers of the compounds of the invention, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism; and mixtures thereof (such as racemates and diastereomeric pairs). Also included are acid addition or base addition salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, D-lactate or L-lysine, or racemic, for example, DL-tartrate or DL-arginine.
When any racemate crystallizes, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.
The present invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in Formula I herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that may be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as, but not limited to, 2H, 3H, 13O, 14O, 15N, 18O, 17O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36Cl. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula 1, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14O are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically-labeled compounds the invention may generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Exemplification below, by substituting an isotopically-labeled reagent for a non-isotopically-labeled reagent.
The compounds of this invention may be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. Depending on the particular compound, a salt of the compound may be advantageous due to one or more of the salt's physical properties, such as enhanced pharmaceutical stability in differing temperatures and humidities, or a desirable solubility in water or oil. In some instances, a salt of a compound also may be used as an aid in the isolation, purification, and/or resolution of the compound.
Where a salt is intended to be administered to a patient (as opposed to, for example, being used in an in vitro context), the salt preferably is pharmaceutically acceptable. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt prepared by combining a compound of Formula I with an acid whose anion, or a base whose cation, is generally considered suitable for human consumption. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly useful as products of the methods of the present invention because of their greater aqueous solubility relative to the parent compound. For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of this invention are non-toxic “pharmaceutically acceptable salts.” Salts encompassed within the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to non-toxic salts of the compounds of this invention which are generally prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid.
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention when possible include those derived from inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydrofluoric, boric, fluoroboric, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric, carbonic, sulfonic, and sulfuric acids, and organic acids such as acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isothionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, trifluoromethanesulfonic, succinic, toluenesulfonic, tartaric, and trifluoroacetic acids. Suitable organic acids generally include but are not limited to aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic, and sulfonic classes of organic acids.
Specific examples of suitable organic acids include but are not limited to acetate, trifluoroacetate, formate, propionate, succinate, glycolate, gluconate, digluconate, lactate, malate, tartaric acid, citrate, ascorbate, glucuronate, maleate, fumarate, pyruvate, aspartate, glutamate, benzoate, anthranilic acid, stearate, salicylate, p-hydroxybenzoate, phenylacetate, mandelate, embonate (pamoate), methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, pantothenate, toluenesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, sufanilate, cyclohexylaminosulfonate, algenic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, galactarate, galacturonate, adipate, alginate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, dodecylsulfate, glycoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, heptanoate, hexanoate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalesulfonate, oxalate, palmoate, pectinate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, thiocyanate, and undecanoate.
Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts, i.e., sodium or potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, e.g., calcium or magnesium salts; and salts formed with suitable organic ligands, e.g., quaternary ammonium salts. In another embodiment, base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts, including aluminum, arginine, benzathine, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, meglumine, olamine, tromethamine and zinc salts.
Organic salts may be made from secondary, tertiary or quaternary amine salts, such as tromethamine, diethylamine, N,N′-benzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine), and procaine. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with agents such as lower alkyl (C1-C6) halides (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (i.e., dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (i.e., decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), arylalkyl halides (i.e., benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.
In one embodiment, hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulphate and hemicalcium salts.

The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions.
Examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.
Formulations of the present invention include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred per cent, this amount will range from about 0.1 per cent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 10 percent to about 30 percent.
In certain embodiments, a formulation of the present invention comprises an excipient selected from the group consisting of cyclodextrins, celluloses, liposomes, micelle forming agents, e.g., bile acids, and polymeric carriers, e.g., polyesters and polyanhydrides; and a compound of the present invention. In certain embodiments, an aforementioned formulation renders orally bioavailable a compound of the present invention.
Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.
Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. A compound of the present invention may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.
In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules, trouches and the like), the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds and surfactants, such as poloxamer and sodium lauryl sulfate; (7) wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate, and non-ionic surfactants; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, zinc stearate, sodium stearate, stearic acid, and mixtures thereof; (10) coloring agents; and (11) controlled release agents such as crospovidone or ethyl cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-shelled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.
The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be formulated for rapid release, e.g., freeze-dried. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds of the invention include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.
Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.
Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.
Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the invention with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.
Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.
Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required.
The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions utilizing one or more of the present compounds along with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, vehicles, etc.
Topical formulations of the presently disclosed compounds may be administered topically, (intra)dermally, or transdermally to the skin or mucosa. Topical administration using such preparations encompasses all conventional methods of administration across the surface of the body and the inner linings of body passages including epithelial and mucosal tissues, including transdermal, epidermal, buccal, pulmonary, ophthalmic, intranasal, vaginal and rectal modes of administration. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, colloid, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibres, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Such topical formulations may be prepared in combination with additional pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.
In certain embodiments, a penetration enhancer may be used. Examples of penetration enhancers include, for example, saturated C10-C18 fatty alcohols (such as decyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), cis-unsaturated C10-C18 fatty alcohols (such as oleyl alcohol, linoleyl alcohol, γ-linolenyl alcohol and linolenyl alcohol), C10-C18 fatty acids (which when saturated may include capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid and arachidic acid), cis-unsaturated fatty acids (such as palmitoleic acid (cis-9-hexadecenoic acid), oleic acid (cis-9-octadecenoic acid), cis-vaccenic acid (cis-11-octadecenoic acid), linoleic acid (cis-9,12-octadecadienoic acid), γ-linolenic acid (cis-6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid), linolenic acid (cis-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid) and arachidonic acid (cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid)). In certain embodiments, the penetration enhancers may be used amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 5% (w/v).
In certain embodiments, topical formulations which contain one or more compounds of the invention in therapeutically effective amounts that may be given in daily or twice daily doses to patients in need.
The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. Other excipients which enhance the stability of the formulations include aldehyde scavengers, such as glycerine and propylene glycol, and antioxidants, such as butyl hydroxyanisole (BHA), butyl hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), polyphenols, tocopherols (Vitamin E), and their derivatives.
Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to a compound of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.
Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound of the present invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.
Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye include, for example, eye drops wherein the compound of this invention is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier. A typical formulation suitable for ocular or aural administration may be in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (i.e., absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (i.e., silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl alcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methylcellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.
For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the active compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of a solution or suspension from a pump spray container that is squeezed or pumped by the patient or as an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant. Formulations suitable for intranasal administration are typically administered in the form of a dry powder (either alone; as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose; or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain sugars, alcohols, antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.
Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.
These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the subject compounds may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly (anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.
When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99% (more preferably, 10 to 30%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
The preparations of the present invention may be given orally, parenterally, topically, or rectally. They are of course given in forms suitable for each administration route. For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye lotion, ointment, suppository, etc. administration by injection, infusion or inhalation; topical by lotion or ointment; and rectal by suppositories. Oral administrations are preferred.
The phrases “parenteral administration” and “administered parenterally” as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticulare, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrasternal injection and infusion.
The phrases “systemic administration,” “administered systemically,” “peripheral administration” and “administered peripherally” as used herein mean the administration of a compound, drug or other material other than directly into the central nervous system, such that it enters the patient's system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration.
These compounds may be administered to humans and other animals for therapy by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for example, a spray, rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally and topically, as by powders, ointments or drops, including buccally and sublingually.
Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.
Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient.
The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the rate and extent of absorption, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.
A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.
In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Preferably, the compounds are administered at about 0.01 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, more preferably at about 0.1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, even more preferably at about 0.5 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg.
When the compounds described herein are co-administered with another agent (e.g., as sensitizing agents), the effective amount may be less than when the agent is used alone.
If desired, the effective daily dose of the active compound may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms. In certain embodiments, preferred dosing is one administration per day.
The invention further provides a unit dosage form (such as a tablet or capsule) comprising a compound of Formula I or a specific compound described herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in a therapeutically effective amount for the treatment of an immune or inflammatory disorder, such as one of the particular immune disorders or inflammatory disorders described herein.
General Synthetic Schemes and Procedures
The compounds of Formula I may be prepared by the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of organic chemistry, or modifications and derivatizations that are familiar to those of ordinary skill in the art. The starting materials used herein are commercially available or may be prepared by routine methods known in the art (such as those methods disclosed in standard reference books such as the COMPENDIUM OF ORGANIC SYNTHETIC METHODS, Vol. I-VI (published by Wiley-Interscience)). Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below.
During any of the following synthetic sequences it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This can be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley & Sons, 1981; T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley & Sons, 1991, and T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley & Sons, 1999, which are hereby incorporated by reference.
Compounds of Formula I or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, can be prepared according to the reaction Schemes discussed herein below. Unless otherwise indicated, the substituents in the Schemes are defined as above. Isolation and purification of the products is accomplished by standard procedures, which are known to a chemist of ordinary skill.
It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the various symbols, superscripts and subscripts used in the schemes, methods and examples are used for convenience of representation and/or to reflect the order in which they are introduced in the schemes, and are not intended to necessarily correspond to the symbols, superscripts or subscripts in the appended claims. The schemes are representative of methods useful in synthesizing the compounds of the present invention. They are not to constrain the scope of the invention in any way.
Compounds of Formula I may be prepared as single enantiomer or as a mixture of individual enantiomers which includes racemic mixtures. Methods to obtain preferentially a single enantiomer from a mixture of individual enantiomers or a racemic mixture are well known to those ordinarily skilled in the art of organic chemistry. Such methods include but are not limited to preferential crystallization of diastereomeric salts (e.g. tartrate or camphor sulfonate), covalent derivatization by a chiral, non-racemic reagent followed by separation of the resulting diastereomers by common methods (e.g. crystallization, chromatographic separation, or distillation) and chemical reversion to scalemic compound, Simulated Moving Bed technology, or high/medium-pressure liquid chromatography or supercritical fluid chromatography employing a chiral stationary phase. These techniques may be performed on the final compounds of the invention or on any intermediates to compounds of the invention which bear a stereogenic center. Also, to facilitate separation by any of the methods described above, the compounds of the invention or any intermediates to the compounds of the invention which bear a stereogenic center may be transiently reacted with an achiral reagent, separated, and then reverted to scalemic compound by standard synthetic techniques.
Compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared as described in Scheme A. Cross-coupling of aryl halides A-1 (prepared as described in Schemes B-C) with vinyl boronates (prepared as described in Scheme D) or vinyl boronic acids affords compounds of the Formula A-2. Subsequent reduction of the nitro group and the olefin furnished compounds of Formula A-3. The resulting amine A-3 may be transformed to amides by the reaction with acid chlorides in the presence of base or carboxylic acids with appropriate coupling agents to afford compounds of Formula A-4.
The intermediate of Formula A-1 employed in Scheme A where Y is trifluoromethyl is prepared as described in Scheme B. Transhalogenation of 4-chloro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine (B-1) employing sodium iodide followed by sulfonylation of the resulting iodide B-2 with phenylsulfonyl chloride and base provides compound B-3. Nitration of B-3 with a tetraalkylammonium salt affords compound B-4 which is then subjected to copper-mediated trifluromethylation to provide compound B-5. Alkylation of the indole nitrogen by iodomethane or iodoethane in the presence of an inorganic base provides compounds of the Formula A-1 (Y=trifluoromethyl).
The intermediate of Formula A-1 employed in Scheme A where Y is methyl is prepared as described in Scheme C. Nitration of C-1 provides compound C-2 which is then converted to C-3 by the treatment with trimethylaluminum in the presence of a palladium catalyst. Deprotection of the indole nitrogen followed by iodination provided compound C-5. Alkylation of the indole nitrogen by iodomethane or iodoethane in the presence of an inorganic base provides compounds of the Formula A-1 (Y=methyl).
The intermediate of Formula D-3 employed in Scheme A is prepared as described in Scheme D. Acid-mediated removal of the carbamate functionality found in D-1 followed by acylation of the resulting amine with acid chlorides (R2COCl) or carboxylic acids (R2CO2H) provides compounds of the Formula D-3.
Alternatively, compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared as described in Scheme E. Cross-coupling of aryl halides A-1 (prepared as described in Schemes B-C) with vinyl boronate D-1 followed by reduction of the nitro group and the olefin furnished compounds of the Formula E-2. Subsequent benzoylation of the resulting amine followed by acid-mediated removal of the carbamate functionality provides compounds of the Formula E-4. Acylation of the resulting amine E-4 with acid chlorides (R2COCl) or carboxylic acids (R2CO2H) provides compounds of the Formula E-5.
Alternatively, compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared as described in Scheme F. Compounds of the Formula E-1 (prepared as described in Scheme E) are treated with acid to afford the corresponding amines F-1. The resulting amine is then reacted with an acid chlorides (R2COCl) in the presence of a base or a carboxylic acids (R2CO2H) in the presence of suitable coupling agent to provide compounds of the Formula A-2 which may be further transformed as described in Scheme A.
Carboxylic acids of the Formula R2CO2H employed in Scheme D-E and subsequent Schemes may be commercially available, prepared by procedures described in the literature, or prepared as described in Scheme G. Examples of R2CO2H prepared by literature procedures include the following: (3ar,7ac)-hexahydro-indan-2ξ-carboxylic acid (Granger, R., et al, Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1968, 1445-50.); 3,3,4-trimethyl-pentanoic acid (Beckwith, A., et al, Australian J. Chem. 1977, 30, 2733-39.); and (1S,2R,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (Evans, D. A. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988, 110, 1238.). (R)-2,3,3-Trimethylbutanoic acid and (S)-2,3,3-trimethylbutanoic acid may be prepared as described by Kido, M. et al Tetrahedron: Asym. 2007, 18, 1934-1947; and thietane acid (see WO2013/7582, which is hereby incorporated by reference for the preparation of thietane acid). The following acids were prepared using procedures which are described in this application: (R)-2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)propanoic acid, (S)-2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)propanoic acid, (R)-2-cyclopentylpropanoic acid, and (S)-2-cyclopentylpropanoic acid. Specific examples of R2CO2H according to the Formula G-4 can be prepared from acids G-1 where R may be alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl which are reacted with an optically active chiral oxazolidinone (e.g. (R)-benzyl oxazolidinone, (R)-4-Isopropyl-2-oxazolidinone) to provide compounds of the Formula G-2. Base mediated alkylation and subsequent removal of the oxazolidinone auxiliary furnishes acids of the Formula G-4 in high optical purity. By employing a chiral oxazolidinone of a different absolute configuration (e.g. (S)-benzyl oxazolidinone, (S)-4-Isopropyl-2-oxazolidinone), chiral acids G-4 of both configurations can be obtained.
Alternatively, compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared as described in Scheme H where R may be one or more methyl substituents or a bridged ethynyl radical. Aryl halides of the Formula A-1 (prepared as described in Schemes B-C) are converted to the corresponding boronates through catalytic methods involving palladium. Cross-coupling of the resulting boronate H-1 with vinyl triflates (prepared as described in Schemes I-N,S) followed by reduction of the nitro group and the olefin affords compounds of the Formula H-4. Subsequent benzoylation of the resulting amine followed by acid-mediated removal of the carbamate functionality provides H-6. Acylation of the resulting amine H-6 with acid chlorides (R2COCl) or carboxylic acids (R2CO2H) provides compounds of the Formula H-7.
Triflates of the Formula H-2 employed in Scheme H being substituted twice by methyl at the 2-position of the piperidine ring may be prepared as described in Scheme I. Treatment of the ketone I-1 with base followed by quench with a triflating reagent (e.g. phenyl triflimide) provides compound H-2A.
Triflates of the Formula H-2 employed in Scheme H being substituted by methyl at the 3-position of the piperidine ring may be prepared as described in Scheme J. Hydrogenolysis of J-1 affords the corresponding amine J-2 which is then treated with with base and reagents capable of generating t-butyl carbamates (e.g. di-tert-butyl dicarbonate) to provide J-3. Treatment of the resulting ketone J-3 with base followed by quench with a triflating reagent (e.g. phenyl triflimide) provides compound H-2B.
Triflates of the Formula H-2 employed in Scheme H being substituted by an ethynyl radical connecting both 2-positions of the piperidine ring may be prepared as described in Scheme K. Condensation of compounds K-1 and K-2 in the presence of base affords compound K-3. Diester K-3 undergoes cyclization in the presence of base (e.g. potassium tert-butoxide) to provide K-4 which upon heating results in compound K-5. Carbamoylation of the resulting amine K-5 provides compound K-6. Treatment of the resulting ketone K-6 with base followed by quench with a triflating reagent (e.g. phenyl triflimide) provides compound H-2C.
Triflates of the Formula H-2 employed in Scheme H being substituted by methyl at the 2-position and the 6-position of the piperidine ring may be prepared as described in Scheme L. Treatment of the ketone L-1 with base followed by quench with a triflating reagent (e.g. phenyl triflimide) provides compound H-2D.
Triflates of the Formula H-2 employed in Scheme H being substituted by methyl at the 2-position and the 5-position of the piperidine ring may be prepared as described in Scheme M. Treatment of the ketone M-1 with base followed by quench with a triflating reagent (e.g. phenyl triflimide) provides compound H-2E.
Triflates of the Formula H-2 employed in Scheme H being substituted by methyl at the 3-position and the 5-position of the piperidine ring may be prepared as described in Scheme N. Ketone N-1 is deprotonated with a strong base and then subsequently reacted with an alkyl halide (e.g. methyl iodide) to provide N-2. Hydrogenolysis of N-2 with hydrogen and a palladium catalyst in the presence of a carbomoylating reagent (e.g. di-tert-butyl dicarbonate) affords N-3. Treatment of the resulting ketone N-3 with base followed by quenching with a triflating reagent (e.g. phenyl triflimide) provides compound H-2F.
Alternatively, compounds of Formula (I) where the piperidine is substituted by methyl at the 2-position may be prepared as described in Scheme O. Hydrogenolysis of O-1 followed by acylation of the resulting amine O-2 with acid chlorides (R2COCl) or carboxylic acids (R2CO2H) affords compounds of the Formula O-3. Treatment of the resulting ketone O-3 with base followed by quench with a triflating reagent (e.g. phenyl triflimide) provides compound O-4. Cross-coupling of O-4 with aryl boronates of the Formula H-1 provides compounds of the Formula O-5 which are converted to o-6 after reduction of the nitro group and olefin. Subsequent benzoylation provides compounds of the Formula O-8. This method of preparation may also be applied to the opposite enantiomer relative to what is exemplified.
Compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared as described in Scheme P. Metallation of iodopyridine P-1 followed by conjugate addition of the resulting anion with the nitroalkene P-2 (prepared as described in Scheme Q) provides the substituted pyridine P-3. Removal of the carbamate group through treatment with acid followed by reaction of the resulting amine with carboxylic acids (R2CO2H) or carboxylic acid chlorides (R2COCl) under amide bond-forming conditions provides compounds of the Formula P-5. Reduction of the nitro group followed by treatment with either acidic or basic conditions facilitates cyclization to form 2,3-dihydro-7-azaindoles P-6. Treatment of P-6 with methyl iodide and base affords compounds P-7. Treatment of P-7 with tetraalkylammonium salts results in nitration at the 5-position and aromatization of the ring system. Reduction of the nitro group and subsequent benzoylation through amide bond formation conditions provides compounds of the Formula P-10.
Compounds P-2 employed in Scheme P may be prepared as described in Scheme Q. The commercially available bicyclic ketone was first converted to the carbamate-protected derivative Q-2 by reduction of the benzyl group in the presence of the appropriate carbamic anhydride. Next, homologation of the ketone through the use of phosphonium salts and base furnishes methyl vinyl ether Q-3 which upon treatment with acid provides the corresponding aldehyde Q-4. Treatment of Q-4 with nitromethane in the presence of base followed by elimination of water from the resulting nitroalcohol Q-5 provides nitroalkene P-2.
Compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared as exemplified by the synthetic route described in Scheme R. Lithiation of dihalopyridine R-1 followed by addition to nitroolefin P-2, prepared as described in Scheme P, results in the 1,4-addition product R-2. The amine protecting group is removed in the presence of acid (e.g. HCl) to afford compound R-3 as a corresponding salt form of the acid used. Condensation of R-3 with an appropriate acid chloride (R2COCl) or activated carboxylic acid (R2CO2H) affords compounds of the Formula R-4. A zinc-mediated reductive cyclization reaction on R-4 provides dihydropyrrolopyridines of the Formula R-5. Methylation of R-5 using iodomethane and sodium hydride followed by nitration-oxidation using tetramethylammonium nitrate affords compounds of the Formula R-7. Zinc-mediated methylation of R-7 provides 4-methylpyrrolopyridines of the Formula R-8. Reduction of the nitro group, followed by acylation with an appropriate benzoyl chloride (XCOCl) or activated benzoic acid (XCO2H) furnishes compounds of the Formula R-9.
Triflates of the Formula H-2 employed in Scheme H being bridged by an ethylene (—CH2CH2—) group between the 2- and 6-positions of the piperidine ring may be prepared as described in Scheme S. Treatment of the ketone S-1 with base followed by quench with a triflating reagent (e.g. phenyl triflimide) provides compound H-2G.

Preparation of (R)-3-cyano-N-(1,4-dimethyl-3-(1-(2,3,3-trimethylbutanoyl)piperidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)benzamide
Step 1: 4-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine. A solution of MeMgBr (655 mL, 1.97 mol, 3 M in ether) was added dropwise to a stirred suspension of 4-chloro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine (60 g, 393.2 mmol) and Pd(dppf)Cl2 (5.75 g, 7.86 mmol) in toluene (1200 mL) at room temperature under N2. After addition, the reaction mixture was purged with N2 for several times and then was heated at 80° C. for 3.5 hr. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into ice-water slowly. After standing overnight, the mixture was filtered and further washed with EtOAc several times. The filtrate was extracted with EtOAc (2×5 L). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. The residue was triturated with PE to give the title compound (48.2 g, 93%) as a off-yellow solid. 1HNMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 11.27 (br. s., 1H), 8.25-8.23 (m, 1H), 7.37-7.35 (m, 1H), 6.93-6.91 (m, 1H), 6.55-6.53 (m, 1H), 2.60 (s, 3H).
Step 2: 4-methyl-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine. Bu4NBr (9.14 g, 28.4 mmol), KOH (63.6 g, 1.134 mol, 33% in water) and PhSO2Cl (160 g, 908 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of 4-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine (75 g, 567 mmol) in DCM (1600 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2.5 hr. The mixture was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. The residue was triturated with MTBE to afford the title compound (112 g, 72.7%) as a brown solid. 1HNMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.32-8.30 (m, 1H), 8.21-8.15 (m, 2H), 7.70-7.68 (m, 1H), 7.58-7.52 (m, 1H), 7.50-7.42 (m, 2H), 6.99-6.97 (m, 1H), 6.63-6.61 (m, 1H), 2.48 (s, 3H).
Step 3: 4-methyl-5-nitro-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine.

EXAMPLE 50
Preparation of (R)—N-(3-(1-(2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)propanoyl)piperidin-4-yl)-1,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)-3-cyanobenzamide
Step 1: 2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)acetic acid. This acid was prepared according to the literature procedure with some modifications (Kaszynski, P.; McMurdie, N. D.; Michl, J. J. Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 307). To a stirred suspension of 1,1-dibromo-2.2-bis(chloromethyl)cyclopropane (3.0 g, 9.1 mmol) in pentane (10 mL) at −78° C. was added slowly MeLi (1.6 M in Et2O, 14.2 mL, 22.7 mmol). The resulting yellow mixture was stirred for 15 min at the same temperature, and then the dry ice-acetone bath was replaced with ice-water bath. The reaction was allowed to stir at 0° C. After 1 hr, the cold bath was removed and the pale yellow reaction mixture was heated to 40° C. The volatile material was distilled into a flask cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath with intermittent application of low vacuum. After warming the distillate to 0° C., bromo methylacetate (1.44 g, 0.888 mL, 9.1 mmol) and Et2O (10 mL) were added. The resulting clear solution at 0° C. was passed through a flow reactor irradiated with medium pressure Hanovia lamp. After 3 hr, the solution was collected in a flask and concentrated in vacuo to obtain methyl 2-(3-bromobicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)acetate. The crude product was taken up in toluene (5.0 mL). Tributyltin hydride (2.3 mL) and 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (8.0 mg, 0.05 mmol) were added. The resulting clear solution was heated at 80° C. After 2 hr, carbon tetrachloride (0.77 mL) was added and the reaction was stirred for 30 min to destroy the excess tributyltin hydride. Subsequently 10% NaOH in MeOH (8 mL) was added, and the reflux condenser was removed to allow MeOH to evaporate. After another 30 min, the reaction was cooled to ambient temperature and quenched with H2O (15 mL). The reaction mixture was extracted with Et2O (3×5 mL). The remaining yellow aqueous layer was acidified with conc. HCl, and then extracted with EtOAc (3×15 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (MeOH:DCM, 2:98-20:80) to provide the title compound as a colorless oil (364 mg, 35% over 4 steps). LC/MS [M-H]=125.1, 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 2.52 (s, 2H), 2.50 (s, 1H), 1.83 (s, 7H).
Step 2: (R)-3-(2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)acetyl)-4-isopropyloxazolidin-2-one. To a solution of 2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)acetic acid (160 mg, 1.27 mmol) and DMF (2.8 mg, 0.04 mmol) in DCM (1.3 mL) at 0° C. was added thionyl chloride (0.112 mL, 1.52 mmol). The resulting pale yellow solution was stirred at ambient temperature for 3 hr, and then the reaction mixture was carefully concentrated in vacuo to afford the corresponding acid chloride as a yellow oil. In a separate flask, n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 0.608 mL, 1.52 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of (R)-(−)-4-Isopropyl-2-oxazolidinone (196 mg, 1.52 mmol) in THF (5.0 mL) at −78° C. After stirring for 30 min, a solution of the above acid chloride in THF (1.0 mL) was added slowly. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hr at the same temperature. The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (5.0 mL), extracted with EtOAc (3×5 mL), washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified using silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc:Heptane, 7:93-40:60) to provide the title compound (93.5 mg, 32%). LC/MS [M+H]=238.1, 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 4.40 (dt, J=8.0, 3.4 Hz, 1H), 4.14-4.26 (m, 2H), 3.21 (d, J=14.8 Hz, 1H), 3.01 (d, J=14.8 Hz, 1H), 2.46 (s, 1H), 2.29-2.39 (m, 1H), 1.79 (s, 6H), 0.88 (dd, J=13.7, 7.0 Hz, 6H).
Step 3: (R)-3-((R)-2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)propanoyl)-4-isopropyloxazolidin-2-one. To a solution of (R)-3-(2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)acetyl)-4-isopropyloxazolidin-2-one (93.5 mg, 0.394 mmol) in THF (2.5 mL) at −78° C. was added dropwise LDA (2.0 M in THF, 0.227 mL, 0.453 mmol). The resulting yellow solution was stirred for 1 hr, and then iodomethane (280 mg, 0.124 mL, 1.97 mmol) was added slowly. The reaction was allowed to stir at −78° C. for 8 hr, and then warm to ambient temperature overnight. The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl (5.0 mL), extracted with Et2O, washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude was purified using silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc:Heptane, 7:93-40:60) to provide the title compound as a colorless oil (78.2 mg, 79%) and the minor diastereomer (17.4 mg, 12%).

To a solution of (R)-3-((R)-2-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)propanoyl)-4-isopropyloxazolidin-2-one (78.2 mg, 0.311 mmol) in THF (1.5 mL) at 0° C. was added H2O2 (50 wt %, 0.10 mL, 1.74 mmol) followed by dropwise addition of LiOH.H2O (28.7 mg, 0.684 mmol) in H2O (0.5 mL). The ice-water bath was removed and the reaction was allowed to stir at ambient temperature overnight. The reaction was cooled down to 0° C. and quenched with 1.5 M Na2SO3 (1.0 mL), diluted with H2O (3.0 mL). The reaction mixture was extracted with DCM (2×5 mL). The remaining aqueous layer was acidified with 1.0 N HCl and extracted with EtOAc (3×10 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to provide the title compound (43.1 mg, 99%).

Preparation of 3-cyano-N-(3-((1R,5S,8r)-3-isobutyryl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-yl)-1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)benzamide
Step 1: tert-butyl 8-oxo-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylate. BOC anhydride (5.81 g, 26.6 mmol) and Pearlman's catalyst (1.55 g, 23.2 mmol) were successively added to a solution of 3-benzyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-one obtained from commercial sources (CAS 83507-33-9) (5.0 g, 22.0 mmol) in EtOAc (74 mL) at room temperature. The reaction vessel was alternately filled with nitrogen and evacuated (3×) and then filled and evacuated with hydrogen (2×). The mixture was stirred overnight under 100 psi of H2. The mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite® which was washed with ethyl acetate. The filtrate was concentrated and the crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography (heptane:EtOAc, 0:100-100:0) to provide the title compound (4.49 g, 90%) as a solid. LC/MS [M−Me]=211.1. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 4.38 (d, J=14.0 Hz, 1H), 4.20 (d, J=14.0 Hz, 1H), 3.27 (d, J=13.3 Hz, 1H), 3.17 (d, J=13.3 Hz, 1H), 2.24 (d, J=15.6 Hz, 2H), 1.76-1.99 (m, 4H), 1.49 (s, 9H).
Step 2: tert-butyl 8-(methoxymethylidene)-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylate. Potassium tert-butoxide (4.47 g, 39.8 mmol) was added portionwise to a suspension of (methoxymethyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride (12.4 g, 36.1 mmol) and tert-butyl 8-oxo-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylate (4.49 g, 19.9 mmol) in THF (100 mL) at 0° C. After 45 min, the cold bath was removed and the reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction was recooled at 0° C. and a saturated solution of NH4Cl was added until pH=6. After warming to room temperature, the mixture was diluted with water and extracted with DCM. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried with Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The resulting oil was diluted with a small amount of ether and a large volume of heptane. After vigorous stirring for 1 h, the resulting solid was filtered off and washed with additional heptane. The filtrate was concentrated and the resulting oil was purified by silica gel chromatography (heptane:EtOAc, 100/0-70/30) to provide the title compound (4.73 g, 94%). LC/MS [M−Me]=239.1. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 5.86 (s, 1H), 4.02 (t, J=12.1 Hz, 1H), 3.79-3.94 (m, 1H), 3.57 (s, 3H), 2.76-3.05 (m, 3H), 2.41 (m, 1H), 1.58-1.65 (m, 4H), 1.47 (br. s., 9H).
Step 3: tert-butyl (8-anti)-formyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylate. Water (0.473 mL) followed by para-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (2.71 g, 13.8 mmol) was added to a solution of tert-butyl 8-(methoxymethylidene)-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylate (3.33 g, 13.14 mmol) in acetone (87.6 mL) at 0° C. The mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 2 h and was quenched at the same temperature with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 until pH=8. Acetone was carefully removed under vacuum (bath at 10° C.) and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried with Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to afford a mixture of predominantly undesired diastereomer (10.09 ppm) versus desired aldehyde (9.62 ppm) in a 3:1 ratio. Complete epimerization was obtained after stirring the crude mixture at room temperature in a mixture of DCM (13.1 mL) and DBU (26.3 mmol, 3.93 mL). EtOAc (100 mL) was added and DCM was carefully evaporated (150 mbar, bath 35° C.) leaving most of the EtOAc in the flask. The reaction was then quenched with a saturated solution of NH4Cl. The phases were separated and the organic phase was washed with a saturated solution of NH4Cl followed by brine, dried with Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The resulting oil was purified by silica gel chromatography (heptane/EtOAc, 100:0-0:100) to afford the title compound (2.41 g, 77%) as a solid.

Nitromethane (815 μL, 15.0 mmol) and potassium tert-butoxide (1 M in THF, 2.0 mL, 2.0 mmol) were successively added to a solution of tert-butyl (8-anti)-formyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylate (2.40 g, 10.0 mmol) in a mixture of THF:t-BuOH (1:1, 10 mL). The mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 1 h, warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The reaction was quenched with a saturated solution of NH4Cl. The phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with DCM. The combined organic phases were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. After drying the crude residue for 1 h under high vacuum, the title compound (3.10 g, 100%) was obtained as a white solid and was used for the next step without purification.

Methanesulfonyl chloride (4.71 mmol, 0.367 mL) was then slowly added. After stirring for 10 min at 0° C., the mixture was quenched with water. The layers were separated and the organic phase was washed with a saturated aqueous of NH4Cl and then filtered through a plug of fluorisil eluting with additional DCM. The filtrate was dried with Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to afford the title compound (1.11 g, 92%) as a colorless oil.

EXAMPLE 101
Assay of Co-Activator Recruitment by TR-FRET
The activity of compound of the invention can be determined by a co-activator recruitment by TR-FRET (time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) assay. In general, the assay is based on the interaction between N-terminally Six-Histidine-tagged-RORC2 ligand binding domain (6-His-RORC2 LBD), expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography, and biotin-coactivator peptide SRC1-2 (biotin-aminohexanoic acid-CPSSHSSLTERHKILHRLLQEGSPS-NH2; SEQ ID NO: 1) containing the LXXLL (SEQ ID NO: 2) consensus domain which is responsible for receptor binding. This interaction is detected by addition of Europium labeled-anti-His antibody (Ex. 337 nm, Em. 620 nm, which binds to 6His) and Streptavidin-APC (Ex. 620 nm, Em. 665 nm, which binds to biotin). When receptor and coactivator are bound to each other, upon shining light at 337 nm on the sample, the Europium emits fluorescence that excites APC due to close proximity (FRET) and this signal is measured at 665 nm. Due to the long lasting fluorescence emission of Europium, the non-specific, short-lived fluorescence is time-resolved (TR) from the fluorescence of interest. Inhibitors of the interaction of receptor and coactivator peptide are detected by a decrease in TR-FRET signal.
Specifically, in one embodiment the aforementioned assay was performed as outlined below. The assay was carried out in black polystyrene, 384-well plates in a total assay volume of 50.5 μL. The assay buffer contained 50 mM TRIS-HCL pH 7.5, 1 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, and 5 mM dithiothreitol. The final concentration of reagents was 6.3 nM RORC2 LBD, 200 nM SRC1-2, 50 nM streptavidin APC, 1 nM Europium-labeled anti-His antibody, and varying concentrations of compounds such that final concentration of DMSO is 1% (v/v). The assay steps were: (1) dispensing 500 μL compound at 100× final concentration in DMSO (test wells) or DMSO only (control wells for no inhibition); and (2) dispensing 50 μL mixture of the other assay components including receptor (test wells) or excluding receptor (control wells for maximal inhibition).
Assay mixtures were incubated are room temperature for 3 hr and read in EnVision 2100 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at Excitation Filter 320, Emission Europium Filter 615, Emission APC Filter 665, Dichroic Mirror D400/D630.
TR-FRET signal was determined by calculating the ratio of 665 nm by 615 nm and IC50 values of compounds of the invention (Table 1) were determined by the non-linear regression analysis of dose response curves.

EXAMPLE 102
Assay of Gal4-RORC2 Activity by Luciferase Reporter
The activity of compound of the invention can be also be determined by a luciferase reporter Gal4-RORC2 activity assay. In general, Neuro2A cells (murine neuroblastoma cell line obtained from HPACC, cat #89121404) are transiently transfected with a mammalian expression vector (pM) containing Gal4-RORC2 LBD and a Gal4-responsive reporter gene containing firefly luciferase (5×GAL4UAS-Luc3). Gal4-RORC2 LBD is constitutively active in the transfected Neuro2a cells, resulting in a robust luciferase response in the absence of stimulation. Upon treatment with an RORC2 inhibitor the transcriptional response is decreased and the magnitude of the decrease in response is dose-dependently related to the intrinsic efficacy of the inhibitor.
Specifically, the growth medium was composed by MEM EBS w/o L-glutamine, 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1× non-essential aminoacid (NEAA); the seeding medium was composed by MEM EBS w/o L-glutamine, w/o phenol red, 4% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1× NEAA, 1% Penicillin (10,000 U/mL)/Streptomycin (10,000 μg/mL); and the assay medium was composed by MEM EBS w/o L-glutamine, w/o phenol red, 4% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1× NEAA, 1% Penicillin (10,000 U/mL)/Streptomycin (10,000 μg/mL). In addition, Neuro2A cells were cultured in growth medium in humidified chambers at 37° C. and 5% CO2 using standard tissue culture procedures.
On day one of the assay, cells were seeded and transfected. Specifically, Neuro2A cells were suspended in seeding medium and mixed with plasmids and transfection reagent which was dissolved in OptiMEM I reduced serum medium (InVitrogen), and then seeded to 384-well plates (Corning, Black, Clear bottom) in 40 μL/well containing 12,500 cells, 17.25 ng Gal4-Luc3, 5.75 ng either empty pM vector (‘no receptor control’ wells) or pM-Gal4RORgamma-LBD, and 0.11 μL Lipofectamine2000.
On day two of the assay, the cells were treated with compounds of the invention. Specifically, the treatment was started 20-24 hr after seeding and transfection of the cells. Compounds of the invention were serially diluted in a 384-well polypropylene plate with assay medium containing 0.5% (v/v) DMSO at 5× final assay concentration. 10 μL of the compounds (or 0.5% DMSO in assay medium for ‘no compound control’ wells) were transferred from the dilution plate to the 384-format cell plate such that final assay volume was 50 μL and final DMSO concentration was 0.1% (v/v), followed by incubation for 20-24 hr in humidified chambers at 37° C. and 5% CO2.
On day three of the assay, luminescence was measured and the results analyzed. Specifically, 10 μL of SteadyLite Plus reagent (Perkin Elmer) was added to each well. The cell plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark before reading of luminescence on the MicroBeta Trilux (Wallac). IC50 values of the compounds tested were determined by the non-linear regression analysis of dose response curves.

EXAMPLE 103
Assay of IL-17 Production from Human Th17 Cells
The activity of compound of the invention can be also be determined by an IL-17 production from human Th17 cells assay. In general, this assay measures blockade of IL-17 production, the signature cytokine of T helper 17 (Th17) cells, by compounds. Purified human CD4+ T cells are stimulated with anti-CD3+anti-CD28 and incubated with a cytokine cocktail that induce their differentiation into Th17 in the absence or presence of various concentrations of compound. After 6 days, IL-17A concentration is measured in the cell culture supernatant with an ELISA kit (MSD).
Preparation of human CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells were purified from buffy coats from healthy donors (obtained from Massachusetts General Hospital) by negative selection the following procedure: Mixing 25 mL of blood with 1 mL of Rosette Sep CD4+ T cell enrichment cocktail (StemCell Technologies) followed by application of a layer of 14 mL Ficoll Paque Plus (Amersham GE Healthcare) and subsequent centrifugation at 1200 g for 20 min at room temperature. The Ficoll layer was then harvested and washed with phosphate saline buffer containing 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and cells were resuspended with RPMI medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 10% (v/v) DMSO, frozen and kept in LN2 until used.
On the first day of the assay, a vial containing 107 CD4+ T cells is thawed rapidly in 37° C. water bath, immediately transferred into 20 mL X-Vivo 15 medium (Lonza), is spun for 6 min at 300×g, the supernatant is discarded, and the resulting pellet is re-suspended at 106 cells/mL in 50 mL fresh X-Vivo 15 medium, followed by storage overnight in a tissue culture vessel in a humidified chamber at 37° C. and 5% CO2. Serial dilutions of compounds of the invention are prepared at 10× final concentration in X-Vivo15 medium containing 3% (v/v) DMSO.
On the second day of the assay, a 384-well tissue culture plate was coated with 10 μg/mL anti-hCD3 (eBioscience) at 50 After 2 hr at 37° C., the supernatant is discarded and the coated plates are kept in a sterile tissue culture hood.
Cytokine plus anti-CD28 cocktail is prepared by mixing 25 ng/mL hIL-6 (Peprotech), 5 ng/mL hTGFbetal (Peprotech), 12.5 ng/mL IL-1beta (Peprotech), 25 ng/mL hIL-21, 25 ng/mL hIL-23 (R&D Systems), and 1 ug/mL anti-hCD28 (eBioscience) in X-Vivo 15 medium. The cytokine plus anti-CD28 cocktail with CD4+ cells is prepared such that the cocktail is diluted 10-fold and cell density is 0.22×106/mL. The mixture is incubated 1 hr at 37° C.
90 μL (20,000 cells) dispensed per well in the anti-hCD3 coated plate prepared as noted above.
10μL 10× compound is added per well (final DMSO=0.3%) from the compound plate that was previously prepared, followed by 6 days of incubation in a tissue culture vessel in a humidified chamber at 37° C. and 5% CO2.
On day six of the assay, production of IL-17A in 10 μL of the supernatant is determined by sandwich ELISA using 384w hIL17 MSD plates following the manufacturer's protocol. Measurement is carried out in a Sector Imager 6000 by the same manufacturer. Signal units from the instrument are converted to pg/mL using a calibration curve with known amounts of IL-17A. IC50 values of test compounds (Table 2) are determined by the non-linear regression analysis of dose response curves.

Inhibition of Superantigen-Induced Th17 Cytokine Production
Exotoxins called “superantigens” are among the most powerful T cell activators. Superantigens bind to the cell surface of major histocompatibilty complex (MHC) molecules, without intracellular processing. They stimulate T cells via the T cell receptor, irrespective of the antigen specificities. Therefore, bacterial superantigens are able to activate a large pool of CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells in contrast to the low T cell frequency for conventional antigens. CD4+ T cells can be classified into various subsets (Th0, Th1, Th2, Th17) based on their respective cytokine secretion profiles. Th0 cells are uncommitted naïve precursor cells that primarily produce IL-2 upon stimulation. Th0 cells upon activation can differentiate into Th1, Th2, or the Th17 subset depending on the local cytokine milieu. Th1 cells mainly produce Inf-γ; Th2 cells, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and Th17 cells, IL-17, and IL-22. During a classical immune response, the differentiation of T helper subset occurs over days, or longer. In the superantigen in-vivo model in mice injection of superantigen triggers a rapid transcription and translation of the various cytokines (i.e. IL-2, IL-4, Inf-γ, IL-17) of the different Th subsets after only 6 hr. A RORγt inhibitor given to animals prior to the superantigen stimulus would impair the Th17 cytokine profile without affecting the cytokine profile of the other Th subsets (Th0, Th1, Th2). The model uses approximately 8 week old C57BL/6, Balb/c, or C3H/HeJ mice which are dosed orally with compound 1 to 2 hr prior to superantigen injection on the day of the experiment (Day 0) based on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the compound. An optional dose may be given the day before superantigen injection (Day −1) to further inhibit the response if necessary. C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice will be sensitized 1 hr prior to supernatigen injection with approximately 25 mg/mouse D-Galactosamine intraperitoneally (C3H/HeJ mice do not need to be sensitized). Based on the literature superantigen is typically given at 10 μg/mouse intraperitoneally. Mice will be sacrificed at 3 hr for RNA analysis or up to 6 hr for cytokine analysis.

Imiquimod Assay
Commercially available 5% imiquimod (IMQ) cream (3M Pharmaceuticals) is applied to the back and right ear of each experimental mouse for two consecutive days. Control mice are treated similarly with a commercially available vehicle cream. The experimental mice are then administered with RORγt inhibitors, and the control mice with vehicle, for 4 days. The ear thickness is measured on all days by digital micrometer (Mitutoyo). Tissues, such as ears and speens, are harvested on Day 5 for RNA analysis. Ear swelling and serum measurements are also made.

IL-23 Injection Model of Mouse Skin Inflammation
Ears from BALB/c mice were each injected intra-dermally every other day with 150 ng of mouse recombinant IL-23 (eBiosciences) or PBS in a total volume of 25 μl. Ear swelling was measured in triplicate using a micrometer (Mitutoyo) right before each IL-23 challenge. On Day 14, mice were euthanized and ears were collected for measurement of cytokine levels, gene expression levels and hystopathological evaluation. Mice were administered 3-100 mg/kg of an RORC2 modulator or vehicle once daily orally for the duration of the study. Alternatively, the RORC2 modulator was applied topically once or twice daily using a standard formulation (EtOH:propylene glycol:dimethyl isosorbide:DMSO, 38:30:15:15) at a concentration of 0.1% to 5.0%.

Data collection was performed on a Bruker APEX diffractometer at room temperature. Data collection consisted of omega and psi scans.
The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELX software suite in the space group P21/n. The structure was subsequently refined by the full-matrix least squares method. All non-hydrogen atoms were found and refined using anisotropic displacement parameters.
The hydrogen atoms located on nitrogen was found from the Fourier difference map and refined with distances restrained. The remaining hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and were allowed to ride on their carrier atoms. The final refinement included isotropic displacement parameters for all hydrogen atoms.
The final R-index was 6.6%. A final difference Fourier revealed no missing or misplaced electron density.

EXAMPLE 108
Single Crystal X-Ray Analysis of (S)-tert-butyl 4-(5-amino-1-methyl-4-(trifluorornethyl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)-2,2-dimethylpiperidine-1-carboxylate
(S)-tert-butyl 4-(5-amino-1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)-2,2-dimethylpiperidine-1-carboxylate is the undesired chiral product of step 1 of Example 49. A crystal suitable for X-ray analysis (a plate with the dimenstions 0.4×0.36×0.48 mm−1) was selected from the bulk material by the use of a polarizing microscope.
The crystal was mounted on a MiTeGen™ mount with mineral oil and diffraction data (psi- and omega-scans) were collected at 100 K on a Bruker-AXS X8 Kappa diffractometer coupled to an APEX2 CCD detector with CuKα radition (λ=1.54178 A) form an 1 μS microsource. Data reduction was carried out with the program SAINT (Bruker (2011). SAINT, Bruker-AXS Inc., Madison, Wis., USA) and semi-imperical absorption correction based on equivalents was performed with the program SADABS (Sheldrick, G. M., (2009). SADABS, University of Göttingen, Germany).
The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXT software suite (Sheldrick, G. M., (2014). SHELXT, University of Göttingen, Germany) in the space group P21, with one target molecule per asymmetric unit. The structure was subsequently refined against F2 on data with SHELXL (Sheldrick, G. M., Acta Cryst. 2008, A64, 112-122) using established refined techniques (Müller, P., Crystallography Reviews 2009, 15, 57-83). All non-hydrogen atoms were found and refined using anisotropic displacement parameters.
All carbon-bound hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions and refined using a riding model while constraining their Uiso to 1.2 times the Ueq of the atoms to which they bind (1.5 times for methyl groups). Coordinates for the hydrogen atoms on nitrogen were taken from the difference Fourier synthesis. Those hydrogen atoms were subsequently refined semi-freely with the help of N—H distance restraints (target value 0.91(2) Å) while constraining their Uiso to 1.2 times the Ueq of the corresponding nitrogen atom. FIG. 2 is an ORTEP Drawing of (S)-tert-butyl 4-(5-amino-1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)-2,2-dimethylpiperidine-1-carboxylate. Pertinent crystal, data collection and refinement are summarized in Table 8. Hydrogen bond parametiers [A and °] are shown in Table 9. Atomic coordinates, bond lengths, bond angles, torsion angles and displacement parameters are listed in Tables 10-13. The diffraction data, show significant anomalous signal and the absolute structure could be established with confidence. The configurations of the chiral carbon atom C10 is S.  TABLE 8
