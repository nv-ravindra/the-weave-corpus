TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention is related to an improved process for the preparation of amino-substituted 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole compounds of formula I, such as the compound 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(n-propylamino)benzothiazole. The invention further relates to an improved synthesis of (R)-2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(n-propylamino)benzothiazole. The invention also relates to the methods and intermediates associated with the synthetic process.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The compound 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(n-propylamino)benzothiazole is a synthetic aminobenzothiazole derivative whose (6S) enantiomer, commonly known as pramipexole and commercially available under the Mirapex® name, is a potent dopamine agonist and thus mimics the effects of the neurotransmitter, dopamine. The (6R) enantiomer, (R)-(+)-2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(n-propylamino)benzothiazole, or “dexpramipexole,” is an effective mitochondria-targeted neuroprotectant that exhibits excellent anti-oxidative properties, and is currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Synthetic procedures to produce pramipexole/dexpramipexole have been described in patent and non-patent literature. For example, one synthetic process for the preparation of pramipexole is accomplished via reductive amination of propanal with 2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole. Another preparation of pramipexole and dexpramipexole has also been described, where propionic anhydride and 2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole are combined to form the amide intermediate, 2-amino-6-propanoylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole, which is then reduced to pramipexole/dexpramipexole. Unfortunately, the syntheses described above are not suitable for industrial scale preparation as the hydride reducing reagents involved are inherently dangerous and often toxic.
As described in the literature, racemic 2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole can be enantiomerically purified by selective crystallization of the acid addition salt using an optically active acid, such as tartaric acid, followed by neutralization to the free, enantiomerically enriched diamine product. However, this method has limitations as to the optical purity of the resulting 2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole product, with typical maximum optical purities of about 98%-99% ee.
Described herein is an improved synthesis of dexpramipexole using a procedure which includes direct alkylation of 2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole with n-propyl p-toluenesulfonate, followed by the formation of the dihydrochloride salt of dexpramipexole. The methods described herein provide increased yield and chemical purity as well as increased enantiomeric purity of the product. Additionally, the methods described herein provide a process which can be used on an industrial scale.

The above factors relating to the solvent will, to a large degree, dictate the ratio of Compound 1 dihydrochloride Form B to Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) Form A in the resulting sample.

General Synthetic Strategies
A general synthetic strategy to produce compounds of formula II is shown in Scheme 1.
A compound of formula A can be brominated using a reagent such as molecular bromine or N-bromosuccinimide to produce an intermediate of formula B. Intermediate B can then be contacted with thiourea to provide a tetrahydrobenzothiazole intermediate of formula C. The intermediate C can be synthesized from A with or without isolation of intermediate B. Hydrolysis of C to a racemic intermediate of formula II can be performed using basic conditions such as aqueous NaOH or Na2CO3, or by acidic conditions such as HCl, H2SO4 or HBr. The intermediate of formula II can be synthesized from A with or without isolation of intermediate B or C. The steps leading to the formation of a racemic intermediate of formula II can be performed in separate reaction vessels or one reaction vessel, with or without isolation of one or more of intermediates A, B or C. A racemic intermediate of formula II can be enantiomerically enriched by selective crystallization of the acid addition salt of a single enantiomer using a chiral acid such as tartaric acid.
A general scheme to produce compounds of formula I(2HCl-H2O) is shown in Scheme 2.
A compound of formula II can be treated with an alkylating reagent of formula G, wherein R1 is an alkyl group and X is a leaving group, according to Scheme 2. The mono-salt intermediate F, wherein HX is a bound acid such as HCl, HBr, MsOH or TsOH, can be directly converted to the dihydrochloride salt by ion exchange. Alternatively, F can first be converted to the free base and then converted to the dihydrochloride salt by the addition of HCl.

Example 5: Recrystallization and purification of (R)-(+)-2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(n-propylamino)benzothiazole dihydrochloride (1(2HCl-H2O))
Method 1:
Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) (700 g) was added to a reaction vessel, followed by IPA (4354 mL) and water (546 mL). The mixture was stirred and heated to a temperature of about 70-75° C. over 1 hour, and then stirred for an additional 30-60 minutes. The solution was then cooled over about 1 hour to about 50° C. and the slurry was stirred for 30-60 minutes. The mixture was then connected to a vacuum and distilled while gradually reducing the pressure to about 150 Torr until the volume of the mixture was reduced by about 50%. IPA (2000 mL) was added to the mixture and the vacuum step was repeated as above. IPA (2000 mL) was added and the mixture was cooled over 1-1.5 hour to a temperature of about 0-5° C., stirred for 30-60 minutes and the solid Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) product was filtered. The filter cake was washed in two portions with a cold solution containing about 1330 mL IPA and about 70 mL water. The filter cake was then dried to provide the product in 97% yield, about 100% purity by HPLC and about 100% ee.
Method 2:
Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) (70 g, 1 equivalent) was added to a reaction vessel, followed by IPA (341.5 g, 435 mL, 6.22 Volumes) and water (54.6 mL, 0.78 Volumes). The mixture was stirred and heated to a temperature of about 75-80° C. and then stirred for an additional 30 minutes. The mixture was then cooled over about 1 hour to about 50° C. and stirred for about 30 minutes. The mixture was then connected to a vacuum and distilled at a pressure of about 150 Torr at the start to about 100 Torr at the end until the volume of the mixture was reduced to about 3 volumes. IPA (164.9 g, 210 mL, 3 Volumes) was added at 45-55° C. over a period of about 10 minutes to the mixture. The amount of final charge of IPA that leads to a 6% final water content was determined using the equation: Final charge of IPA=((24×KF×S)/(1−6.5×KF))−(2.4×KF). In this equation, “KF” is the water content as determined by the Karl Fischer method (for example, if 7.5% water content is measured, 0.075 is the KF value in the equation), and “S” is the weight in grams of starting compound of Compound 1(2HCl-H2O). The amount of IPA determined from the equation above was then added to the mixture at 45-55° C. over 8 minutes. The mixture was then cooled to a temperature of about 0° C. over 2 hours, and stirred at 0° C. for an additional 1-2 hours. The solid Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) product was then filtered and the filter cake was washed with 1 volume of a mixture containing 5% water in IPA. The filter cake was then dried at a pressure of 30 Torr for 12-16 hours to provide the product as polymorph A in 94-96% yield, with about 100% ee and having a water content of about 6.0±0.2%.
The product Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) was characterized by 1H NMR, producing a spectrum consistent with that shown in FIG. 1 .
Example 6: Determination of Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) Polymorphic Form A
As determined by Solvent/Polymorph screening, Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) Form A is a monohydrate bis-HCl salt and Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) Form B is an anhydrate bis-HCl salt. Form A is a thermodynamic hydrate form while Form B is a stable anhydrate form. Form B converts to Form A under exposure to humidity and/or moisture.
Two crystallization experiments were carried out using two different rates. One experiment with a fast cooling, 0.75° C./min from 80° C. to 5° C. in 100 minutes, and the other with a slow cooling, 0.15° C./min from 80° C. to 5° C. in 480 minutes. Solids precipitated throughout these cooling periods were analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRPD) to verify the polymorphic form.
The crystal Form B, the anhydrate form of Compound 1(2HCl-H2O), is formed when Form A is in contact with dry IPA. Tables 1A and 1B below summarize the results of experiments showing the conversion of the Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) filter cake from Form A to Form B upon contact with dry IPA during cake washing.

Example 7: Increased Yield of Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) Polymorphic Form a by Azeotropic Distillation at Reduced Pressure
Form A is highly soluble in water and is formed in a solvent system containing water. Recrystallization of Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) Form A is performed in a binary IPA/H2O system where IPA is an anti-solvent. A previous recrystallization process yielded about 80% product, and was carried out in ca. 6.7 volumes of an 8:1 v/v mixture of IPA to water. The amount and solvent composition were chosen as to prevent product precipitation during the clarifying filtration step (80-85° C.) prior to cooling to 0-5° C. A procedure was developed to increase the yield (>90%) and possibly reduce particle agglomeration. The modified procedure involves removal of water by distillation after initially crystallizing the product from the same 8:1 v/v IPA/Water composition (˜14% w/w).
Since the product is highly soluble in water, yield improvement can be achieved by reducing the amount of water from the initial composition (13.8% w/w). This can be accomplished after first crystallizing the product (to desired Form A) followed by distillation to remove water from the mixture.
Thermodynamics of a Binary IPA-Water System
IPA (2-Propanol) forms an azeotropic composition with water. The mixture of 88% IPA and 12% water boils at 80° C. under atmospheric conditions (1.01325 Bar) and the distillate (vapor phase) will have the same composition as the boiling liquid phase. The phase diagram for a binary IPA/water system shows that water can be removed by distillation under azeotropic conditions at atmospheric pressures starting from about 82% IPA (18% water) and temperature ranges of 80-82° C.
The ranges of azeotropic conditions for a IPA-Water binary system under different pressures, from atmospheric to reduced pressure (vacuum), is tabulated in Table 2. This azeotropic composition was predicted at selected system pressures using UNIFAC group contribution with DynoChem software (DynoChem; 2011 Version 4.0.0.0; Performance Fluid Dynamics Ltd.).

 9-16%  53 mbar (40 Torr)  21-23° C.
Distillation Procedure for Adjustment of Water Contents
Azeotropic distillation for removal of water is performed under reduced pressure to lower the boiling point of the IPA/water azeotrope to maintain a slurry of Compound 1(2-HCl-H2O) during the distillation and minimize loss of bound water (hydrate).
At temperatures below 50° C. some product crystals (monohydrate, Form A) precipitate out of solution (13.8% water in IPA). As the volume of the mixture is reduced during distillation, the remaining product crystals (monohydrate, Form A) also form.
The crystallization characteristics of Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) in an 8:1 (v/v) IPA to Water solvent system show that in 7 volumes of a 14% water in IPA solvent system, Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) can be expected to completely dissolve at temperatures greater than 75° C., and nucleate upon cooling at temperatures between 50-60° C.
Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) was initially dissolved in 7 volumes of a 13.8 wt % water in IPA at 80° C. and cooled to 50° C. to produce some crystals. The pressure was then reduced to about 150 Torr (˜200 mBar) and the mixture distilled at 40-45° C. Distillation was discontinued when the volume of the mixture in the reactor decreased by about half. At this point, the water content in the mixture remained about 13.8 wt % and more product precipitated out. A prescribed amount of IPA was then added to the reactor to increase the volume, resulting in a total water content of about 6-7 wt % in the mixture. This procedure is repeated once to obtain the final water content 3-5 wt %. Table 3 summarized the results using this procedure.  TABLE 3

Table 3 shows that the product met the specification for chemical and chiral purity and was confirmed as Form A. Some examples resulted in water content below theoretical level for monohydrate (5.95% wt) with no indication of a presence of anhydrous crystal Form B. This material was re-slurried in a solution of 5 wt % water in IPA for 24 hours in order to bring up the water level.
An improved recrystallization procedure (Example 5, Method 2) was developed to improve operational aspects of the distillation process. In this improved procedure, the final water level in the pot is controlled to be within 5-7% wt.
Control of Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) Form A by Reduced Pressure Distillation
The conversion of Form A (hydrate) to Form B (anhydrate) is mediated by exposure of Form A to non-aqueous 2-Propanol or thermally by heating the solid to around 120°.
In this process, only crystal Form A precipitates upon cooling a solution of Compound 1(2HCl-H2O) in ˜13% aqueous 2-propanol. These crystals of Form A remain in contact with aq. 2-propanol (7-13% water) throughout the distillation and are filtered out of a 5-7% aqueous solution after the final water content adjustment by adding 2-propanol.
In an anomalous case where mixed crystals a forms A & B are produced, they can be reconverted to Form A completely by re-slurrying in an aqueous 2-propanol solution.
Example 8: Improved Enantiomeric Purity of the Tosylate Salt of Pramipexole by Precipitation from an ACN:Water Solution (Spiking Study)
Enantiomerically pure (R)-2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole was prepared through a classical resolution process from the racemate. Therefore, (R)-2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole was expected to contain some of its enantiomeric isomer (S)-2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole as an impurity. To understand the fate of this impurity, a spiking study was employed. In this study, (S)-2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole was used as the starting material to produce pramipexole p-toluenesulfonic acid salt, the enantiomeric isomer of Compound 1(HOTs), under selected alkylation reaction conditions. The data are summarized in Table 5. The conclusion from this study was that (S)-2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole with an enantiomeric excess of 89% could be converted to pramipexole p-toluenesulfonic acid salt with an enantiomeric excess of 98% and (S)-2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole with an enantiomeric excess of 95% could be converted to pramipexole p-toluenesulfonic acid salt with an enantiomeric excess of 99% by the process disclosed herein. Since Compound 1(HOTs) and pramipexole p-toluenesulfonic acid salt are enantiomeric isomers, the results should apply to Compound 1(HOTs) as well. Therefore, (R)-2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole with an enantiomeric excess of 89% could be converted to Compound 1(HOTs) with an enantiomeric excess of 98% and (R)-2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole with an enantiomeric excess of 95% could be converted to Compound 1(HOTs) with an enantiomeric excess of 99% by the process disclosed herein.

Example 9: Karl Fischer Titration (USP <921> Method 1a) [General Description]
Principle
The titrimetric determination of water is based upon the quantitative reaction of water with an anhydrous solution of sulfur dioxide and iodine in the presence of a buffer that reacts with hydrogen ions.
In the original titrimetric solution, known as Karl Fischer Reagent, the sulfur dioxide and iodine are dissolved in pyridine and methanol. The test specimen may be titrated with the Reagent directly, or the analysis may be carried out by a residual titration procedure. The stoichiometry of the reaction is not exact, and the reproducibility of a determination depends upon such factors as the relative concentrations of the Reagent ingredients, the nature of the inert solvent used to dissolve the test specimen, and the technique used in the particular determination.
Therefore, an empirically standardized technique is used in order to achieve the desired accuracy. Precision in the method is governed largely by the extent to which atmospheric moisture is excluded from the system. The titration of water is usually carried out with the use of anhydrous methanol as the solvent for the test specimen; however, other suitable solvents may be used for special or unusual test specimens.
Apparatus
Any apparatus may be used that provides for adequate exclusion of atmospheric moisture and determination of the endpoint. In the case of a colorless solution that is titrated directly, the endpoint may be observed visually as a change in color from canary yellow to amber. The reverse is observed in the case of a test specimen that is titrated residually. More commonly, however, the endpoint is determined electrometrically with an apparatus employing a simple electrical circuit that serves to impress about 200 mV of applied potential between a pair of platinum electrodes immersed in the solution to be titrated. At the endpoint of the titration a slight excess of the reagent increases the flow of current to between 50 and 150 microamperes for 30 seconds to 30 minutes, depending upon the solution being titrated. The time is shortest for substances that dissolve in the reagent. With some automatic titrators, the abrupt change in current or potential at the endpoint serves to close a solenoid-operated valve that controls the buret delivering the titrant. Commercially available apparatus generally comprises a closed system consisting of one or two automatic burets and a tightly covered titration vessel fitted with the necessary electrodes and a magnetic stirrer. The air in the system is kept dry with a suitable desiccant, and the titration vessel may be purged by means of a stream of dry nitrogen or current of dry air.
Reagent
Prepare the Karl Fischer Reagent as follows. Add 125 g of iodine to a solution containing 670 mL of methanol and 170 mL of pyridine, and cool. Place 100 mL of pyridine in a 250-mL graduated cylinder, and, keeping the pyridine cold in an ice bath, pass in dry sulfur dioxide until the volume reaches 200 mL. Slowly add this solution, with shaking, to the cooled iodine mixture. Shake to dissolve the iodine, transfer the solution to the apparatus, and allow the solution to stand overnight before standardizing. One mL of this solution when freshly prepared is equivalent to approximately 5 mg of water, but it deteriorates gradually; therefore, standardize it within 1 hour before use, or daily if in continuous use. Protect from light while in use. Store any bulk stock of the reagent in a suitably sealed, glass-stoppered container, fully protected from light, and under refrigeration.
A commercially available, stabilized solution of Karl Fischer type reagent may be used. Commercially available reagents containing solvents or bases other than pyridine or alcohols other than methanol may be used also. These may be single solutions or reagents formed in situ by combining the components of the reagents present in two discrete solutions. The diluted Reagent called for in some monographs should be diluted as directed by the manufacturer. Either methanol or other suitable solvent, such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, may be used as the diluent.
Test Preparation
Unless otherwise specified in the individual monograph, use an accurately weighed or measured amount of the specimen under test estimated to contain 2 to 250 mg of water. The amount of water depends on the water equivalency factor of the Reagent and on the method of endpoint determination.
In most cases, the minimum amount of specimen, in mg, can be estimated using the formula:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
FCV/KF
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
in which F is the water equivalency factor of the Reagent, in mg per mL; C is the used volume, in percent, of the capacity of the buret; V is the buret volume, in mL; and KF is the limit or reasonable expected water content in the sample, in percent. C is between 30% and 100% for manual titration, and between 10% and 100% for the instrumental method endpoint determination.
Where the specimen under test is an aerosol with propellant, store it in a freezer for not less than 2 hours, open the container, and test 10.0 mL of the well-mixed specimen. In titrating the specimen, determine the endpoint at a temperature of 10 or higher.
Where the specimen under test is capsules, use a portion of the mixed contents of not fewer than 4 capsules.
Where the specimen under test is tablets, use powder from not fewer than 4 tablets ground to a fine powder in an atmosphere of temperature and relative humidity known not to influence the results.
Where the monograph specifies that the specimen under test is hygroscopic, use a dry syringe to inject an appropriate volume of methanol, or other suitable solvent, accurately measured, into a tared container, and shake to dissolve the specimen. Using the same syringe, remove the solution from the container and transfer it to a titration vessel prepared as directed for Procedure. Repeat the procedure with a second portion of methanol, or other suitable solvent, accurately measured, add this washing to the titration vessel, and immediately titrate. Determine the water content, in mg, of a portion of solvent of the same total volume as that used to dissolve the specimen and to wash the container and syringe, as directed for Standardization of Water Solution for Residual Titrations, and subtract this value from the water content, in mg, obtained in the titration of the specimen under test. Dry the container and its closure at 100 for 3 hours, allow to cool in a desiccator, and weigh. Determine the weight of specimen tested from the difference in weight from the initial weight of the container.
Standardization of the Reagent
Place enough methanol or other suitable solvent in the titration vessel to cover the electrodes, and add sufficient Reagent to give the characteristic endpoint color, or 100±50 microamperes of direct current at about 200 mV of applied potential.
For determination of trace amounts of water (less than 1%), it is preferable to use Reagent with a water equivalency factor of not more than 2.0.
Sodium tartrate may be used as a convenient water reference substance. Quickly add 75 to 125 mg of sodium tartrate (C4H4Na2O6-2H2O), accurately weighed by difference, and titrate to the endpoint. The water equivalence factor F, in mg of water per mL of reagent, is given by the formula:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
2(18.02/230.08)(W/V)
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
in which 18.02 and 230.08 are the molecular weights of water and sodium tartrate dihydrate, respectively; W is the weight, in mg, of sodium tartrate dihydrate; and V is the volume, in mL, of the Reagent consumed in the second titration.
For the precise determination of significant amounts of water (1% or more), use Purified Water as the reference substance. Quickly add between 25 and 250 mg of water, accurately weighed by difference, from a weighing pipet or from a precalibrated syringe or micropipet, the amount taken being governed by the reagent strength and the buret size, as referred to under Volumetric Apparatus 31. Titrate to the endpoint. Calculate the water equivalence factor, F, in mg of water per mL of reagent, by the formula:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
W/V
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
in which W is the weight, in mg, of the water; and V is the volume, in mL, of the reagent required.
Procedure
Unless otherwise specified, transfer 35 to 40 mL of methanol or other suitable solvent to the titration vessel, and titrate with the Reagent to the electrometric or visual endpoint to consume any moisture that may be present. (Disregard the volume consumed, since it does not enter into the calculations.) Quickly add the Test Preparation, mix, and again titrate with the Reagent to the electrometric or visual endpoint. Calculate the water content of the specimen, in mg, taken by the formula:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
SF
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
in which S is the volume, in mL, of the Reagent consumed in the second titration; and F is the water equivalence factor of the Reagent.
