The present invention relates to chemical processes useful for the preparation of a certain pharmaceutical compound known as AZD5363. The invention also relates to an intermediate compound that has been used as part of the above-mentioned chemical processes for the improved preparation of AZD5363.
The pharmaceutical compound ‘AZD5363’ is alternatively known as: (S)-4-amino-N-(1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxypropyl)-1-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)piperidine-4-carboxamide, and its chemical structure is shown below: International patent application PCT/GB2008/050925 (published as WO2009/047563) mentions AZD5363 as ‘Example 9’ and introduces several processes for its preparation on pages 39-42. The published methods for preparing AZD5363 were satisfactory for the preparation of relatively small quantities. However, clinical trials of AZD5363 have started since the filing of WO2009/047563 and in this context, increasing quantities of AZD5363 are now required. In our experience, the problems with the existing methods for preparing AZD5363 include low reaction yields, the formation of impurities and the need for purification steps that are not very amenable to larger-scale use, the use of chemical reagents and solvents that are disadvantageous from an environmental and/or safety and/or cost and/or convenience perspective, relatively long processing times for the overall synthesis, relatively large quantities of chemical waste per gram of AZD5363 isolated, relatively large cost per gram of AZD5363 produced, and challenges with ensuring that impurity levels in the final AZD5363 product are reliably kept to acceptable levels for use in human subjects. Accordingly there is a need for alternative routes for the preparation of AZD5363 and/or improved processing methods. One or more of the above-mentioned needs/problems have been overcome by aspects of the present invention, as described hereinafter.
Although WO2009/047563 discloses several methods for the preparation of AZD5363, our ongoing internal efforts to deliver AZD5363 for use in clinical trials has been prioritised on the route involving a BOC (t-butoxycarbonyl) deprotection as shown below: In our hands, on a large scale, this process suffers from poor throughput and low yields, and operates under high dilution and poor process mass intensity. In particular the BOC deprotection step has a tedious work-up, involving multiple solvent swaps, poor throughput and the formation of impurities, despite process development efforts having been focused on these problems. There remained a problem to produce AZD5363 in a way where the above-mentioned problems are overcome or minimized. According to the first aspect of the present invention, a solution to the problem has now been found. This solution does not merely involve a change of reaction conditions, reagents and/or solvents, but it also involves the use of an intermediate compound.
Accordingly, in the first aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of AZD5363, or a salt of AZD5363, comprising:
(a) the reaction of 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione: or a salt thereof, with (S)-3-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)propan-1-ol, or a salt thereof, in the presence of base; and  (b) either isolating AZD5363 or isolating AZD5363 as a salt.
In one embodiment there is provided a process for the preparation of AZD5363, comprising the reaction of 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione or a salt thereof, with (S)-3-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)propan-1-ol, or a salt thereof, in the presence of base.
In a further embodiment there is provided a process for the preparation of AZD5363, comprising the reaction of 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione with (S)-3-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)propan-1-ol, in the presence of base.
In a further embodiment there is provided a process for the preparation of AZD5363, or a salt of AZD5363, comprising:
(a) the reaction of 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione with (S)-3-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)propan-1-ol, in the presence of base;
and
(b) either isolating AZD5363 or isolating AZD5363 as a salt.
A person skilled in the area of chemistry will recognize that 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione, (S)-3-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-propan-1-ol and AZD5363 each possess at least one nitrogen atom that would be expected to be sufficiently basic to enable the formation of salt forms of the three aforementioned compounds. Each of these three compounds may be used, generated and/or isolated either in ‘free-base’ form, or in the form of a salt, but the skilled person will recognize that the use of a larger quantity of base may be appropriate in the above-mentioned process in the case where one or both of the starting materials are used in the form of a salt.
The above-mentioned process is facilitated by the use of a base. In one respect, such a base may simply be provided by the presence of one or more of 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione in free-base form, (S)-3-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)propan-1-ol in free-base form and/or AZD5363 in free-base form—which may already be present in the reaction mixture, although these compounds are relatively expensive and the addition of a cheaper base provides a more efficient and/or cost effective process. Organic bases include tertiary amine bases, pyridine and substituted pyridine-based bases such as 2,6-lutidine. Examples of cheaper bases that have been used to facilitate the formation of AZD5363 in the above-mentioned process include tertiary amine bases such as triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine and diisopropylethylamine. We have shown that inorganic bases can also be used in this process. Examples of inorganic bases include hydroxides (HO−), carbonates (CO32−) and bicarbonates (HCO3−) of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal (i.e. the metals found in groups 1 and 2 of the periodic table), especially the hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates of Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba.
In one embodiment the base is an organic base or an inorganic base.

In this specification, “C1-6alkyl” means a group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms where the only other atoms within the group are hydrogen atoms and where the group does not contain any double or triple carbon-carbon bonds. “C1-6alkyl” includes straight chain alkyl groups, and for C3-6alkyl groups it includes branched chain alkyl groups and alkyl groups that consist of or include a cycloalkyl group.

In this specification “(C1-6alkyl)3N” means a tertiary amine where each of the 3 substituents is a C1-6alkyl group, as defined herein. For the avoidance of doubt, the C1-6alkyl groups may each be the same or different when more than one such group is mentioned within a molecule such as “(C1-6alkyl)3N”. Examples of “(C1-6alkyl)3N” include triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and tricyclohexylamine.
Typically, when the 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione has been isolated as a free base, the reaction with (S)-3-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)propan-1-ol may be carried out in the presence of 1 to 2 mole equivalents of base. In one embodiment, the reaction of the free base of 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione with (S)-3-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)propan-1-ol may be carried out in the presence of 1.5 mole equivalents of base. Such reaction may use 1.5 mole equivalent of base, plus or minus 20%. In other embodiments such reaction may use 1.5 mole equivalent of base, plus or minus 10%.
When the 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione has been isolated as an acid salt or is prepared in situ using acidic reagents, the reaction with (S)-3-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)propan-1-ol may be carried out in the presence of 2 to 3 mole equivalents of base. In one embodiment, the reaction of the acid salt of 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione with (S)-3-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)propan-1-ol may be carried out in the presence of 2.5 mole equivalents of base. Such reaction may use 2.5 mole equivalent of base, plus or minus 20%. In other embodiments such reaction may use 2.5 mole equivalent of base, plus or minus 10%.
It is well known that chemical processes often work more effectively when the reaction components are partially or wholly dissolved into a suitable solvent. In one respect, such solvent used in the above-mentioned process may simply be provided by the presence of the base that is already included in the reaction mixture, provided that the base is a liquid under the relevant reaction conditions. The skilled person is familiar with a range of solvents that are frequently found to be suitable for organic chemistry reactions of different types. Typical solvents that may be employed for water miscible polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrollidone, dimethyl sulphoxide, sulpholane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile and higher nitriles. An example of a suitable solvent is acetonitrile. Mixtures of solvents may be used, for example in one embodiment a mixture of acetonitrile and water is used. A solvent mixture including water may be preferable when an inorganic base is used as the base, as this may help ensure or encourage dissolution of the inorganic base.
In one embodiment there is provided a process for the preparation of AZD5363, or a salt of AZD5363, comprising:
(a) the reaction of 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione: or a salt thereof, with (S)-3-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)propan-1-ol, or a salt thereof, in the presence of base and solvent; and  (b) either isolating AZD5363 or isolating AZD5363 as a salt.
The processes described herein may provide AZD5363 as a free base, or as a salt if desired. The processes for preparing such a salt are well known and may preferably involve the mixture of the amine compound (e.g. AZD5363) with an appropriate quantity (e.g. 1:1 molar ratio) of an organic or inorganic acid, in a suitable solvent. The resulting salt may sometimes precipitate or crystallize from the solution and in these cases it may be isolated by filtration. The resulting salt may alternatively be isolated by evaporation of the solvent.
In our hands, the process for producing AZD5363 from 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione can sometimes proceed less cleanly and/or less completely than desired, depending on the conditions used. It could be speculated that the anhydride functional group within 8-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-oxa-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione might be susceptible to side reactions, for example reactions with nucleophiles such as hydroxide. Any such reaction could be expected to lead to impurities and lower yields of AZD5363 and might encourage the use of strictly anhydrous solvents and conditions. However, surprisingly, we have found that the use of water as a co-solvent, in combination with an inorganic base is actually very beneficial for achieving low levels of impurities, improving the reaction rate and helping to drive the reaction to completion.
Accordingly, in this aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of AZD5363, or a salt of AZD5363, comprising:
