FIELD
Provided herein are substituted thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine, furo[3,2-d]pyrimidine, and pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine compounds, methods and pharmaceutical formulations for treating Pneumovirinae virus infections, particularly including respiratory syncytial virus infections, and methods and intermediates useful for preparing the compounds.
BACKGROUND
Pneumovirinae viruses are negative-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses that are responsible for many prevalent human and animal diseases. The Pneumovirinae sub-family of viruses is a part of the family Paramyxoviridae and includes human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). Almost all children will have had an HRSV infection by their second birthday. HRSV is the major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infancy and childhood with 0.5% to 2% of those infected requiring hospitalization. The elderly and adults with chronic heart, lung disease or those that are immunosuppressed also have a high risk for developing severe HRSV disease (http://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html). No vaccine to prevent HRSV infection is currently available. The monoclonal antibody palivizumab is available for immunoprophylaxis, but its use is restricted to infants at high risk, e.g., premature infants or those with either congenital heart or lung disease, and the cost for general use is often prohibitive. In addition, nucleoside analog ribavirin has been approved as the only antiviral agent to treat HRSV infections but has limited efficacy. Therefore, there is a need for anti-Pneumovirinae therapeutics.
Examples of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds useful for treating viral infections are described in U.S. 2012/0009147 A1 (Cho et al.), U.S. 2012/0020921 A1 (Cho et al.), WO 2008/089105 A2 (Babu et al.), WO 2008/141079 A1 (Babu et al.), WO 2009/132135 A1 (Butler et al.), WO 2010/002877 A2 (Francom), WO 2011/035231 A1 (Cho et al.), WO 2011/035250 A1 (Butler et al.), WO 2011/150288 A1 (Cho et al.), WO 2012/012465 (Cho et al.), WO 2012/012776 A1 (Mackman et al.), WO 2012/037038 (Clarke et al.), WO 2012/087596 A1 (Delaney et al.), and WO 2012/142075 A1 (Girijavallabhan et al.).
There remains a need for new antiviral agents useful in treating Paramyxoviridae viral infections, including Pneumovirinae viral infections, such as HRSV infections, that are effective and have acceptable toxicity profiles.

Excipients include ascorbic acid and other antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA, carbohydrates such as dextran, hydroxyalkylcellulose, hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose, stearic acid and the like. The pH of the formulations ranges from about 3 to about 11, but is ordinarily about 7 to 10.
While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone it may be preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use, comprise at least one active ingredient, as above defined, together with one or more acceptable carriers and optionally other therapeutic ingredients, particularly those additional therapeutic ingredients as discussed herein. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and physiologically innocuous to the recipient thereof.
The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.
Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.
A tablet is made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom.
For infections of the eye or other external tissues e.g. mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w/w (including active ingredient(s) in a range between 0.1% and 20% in increments of 0.1% w/w such as 0.6% w/w, 0.7% w/w, etc.), preferably 0.2 to 15% w/w and most preferably 0.5 to 10% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.
If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulphoxide and related analogs.
The oily phase of the emulsions may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.
Emulgents and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation include Tween® 60, Span® 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.
The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties. The cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils are used.
Pharmaceutical formulations herein comprise a combination together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients and optionally other therapeutic agents. Pharmaceutical formulations containing the active ingredient may be in any form suitable for the intended method of administration. When used for oral use for example, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, solutions, syrups or elixirs may be prepared. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.
Formulations for oral use may be also presented as hard gelatin capsules where the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcelluose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally-occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.
Oil suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oral suspensions may contain a thickening agent, such as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents, such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid.
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent, and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those disclosed above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.
The pharmaceutical compositions may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil, a mineral oil, such as liquid paraffin, or a mixture of these. Suitable emulsifying agents include naturally-occurring gums, such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, such as soybean lecithin, esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, such as sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of these partial esters with ethylene oxide, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsion may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, such as glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, a flavoring or a coloring agent.
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable or intravenous preparations, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable or intravenous preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 μg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL/hr can occur.
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20%, advantageously 0.5 to 10%, and particularly about 1.5% w/w.
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.
Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for example in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns, such as 0.5, 1, 30, 35 etc., which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis of Pneumovirinae infections as described below.
Another embodiment provides a novel, efficacious, safe, nonirritating and physiologically compatible inhalable composition comprising a compound of Formulas I-IX, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, suitable for treating Pneumovirinae infections and potentially associated bronchiolitis. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts are inorganic acid salts including hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate or phosphate salts as they may cause less pulmonary irritation. Preferably, the inhalable formulation is delivered to the endobronchial space in an aerosol comprising particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) between about 1 and about 5 μm. Preferably, the compound of Formulas I-IX is formulated for aerosol delivery using a nebulizer, pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI), or dry powder inhaler (DPI).
Non-limiting examples of nebulizers include atomizing, jet, ultrasonic, pressurized, vibrating porous plate, or equivalent nebulizers including those nebulizers utilizing adaptive aerosol delivery technology (Denyer, J. Aerosol medicine Pulmonary Drug Delivery 2010, 23 Supp 1, S1-S10). A jet nebulizer utilizes air pressure to break a liquid solution into aerosol droplets. An ultrasonic nebulizer works by a piezoelectric crystal that shears a liquid into small aerosol droplets. A pressurized nebulization system forces solution under pressure through small pores to generate aerosol droplets. A vibrating porous plate device utilizes rapid vibration to shear a stream of liquid into appropriate droplet sizes.
In a preferred embodiment, the formulation for nebulization is delivered to the endobronchial space in an aerosol comprising particles with a MMAD predominantly between about 1 μm and about 5 μm using a nebulizer able to aerosolize the formulation of the compound of Formulas I-IX into particles of the required MMAD. To be optimally therapeutically effective and to avoid upper respiratory and systemic side effects, the majority of aerosolized particles should not have a MMAD greater than about 5 μm. If an aerosol contains a large number of particles with a MMAD larger than 5 μm, the particles are deposited in the upper airways decreasing the amount of drug delivered to the site of inflammation and bronchoconstriction in the lower respiratory tract. If the MMAD of the aerosol is smaller than about 1 μm, then the particles have a tendency to remain suspended in the inhaled air and are subsequently exhaled during expiration.
When formulated and delivered according to the method herein, the aerosol formulation for nebulization delivers a therapeutically efficacious dose of the compound of Formulas I-IX to the site of Pneumovirinae infection sufficient to treat the Pneumovirinae infection. The amount of drug administered must be adjusted to reflect the efficiency of the delivery of a therapeutically efficacious dose of the compound of Formulas I-IX. In a preferred embodiment, a combination of the aqueous aerosol formulation with the atomizing, jet, pressurized, vibrating porous plate, or ultrasonic nebulizer permits, depending on the nebulizer, about, at least, 20, to about 90%, typically about 70% delivery of the administered dose of the compound of Formulas I-IX into the airways. In a preferred embodiment, at least about 30 to about 50% of the active compound is delivered. More preferably, about 70 to about 90% of the active compound is delivered.
In another embodiment, a compound of Formulas I-IX or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is delivered as a dry inhalable powder. The compounds are administered endobronchially as a dry powder formulation to efficacious deliver fine particles of compound into the endobronchial space using dry powder or metered dose inhalers. For delivery by DPI, the compound of Formulas I-IX is processed into particles with, predominantly, MMAD between about 1 μm and about 5 μm by milling spray drying, critical fluid processing, or precipitation from solution. Media milling, jet milling and spray-drying devices and procedures capable of producing the particle sizes with a MMAD between about 1 μm and about 5 μm are well known in the art. In one embodiment, excipients are added to the compound of Formulas I-IX before processing into particles of the required sizes. In another embodiment, excipients are blended with the particles of the required size to aid in dispersion of the drug particles, for example by using lactose as an excipient.
Particle size determinations are made using devices well known in the art. For example a multi-stage Anderson cascade impactor or other suitable method such as those specifically cited within the US Pharmacopoeia Chapter 601 as characterizing devices for aerosols within metered-dose and dry powder inhalers.
In another preferred embodiment, a compound of Formulas I-IX is delivered as a dry powder using a device such as a dry powder inhaler or other dry powder dispersion devices. Non-limiting examples of dry powder inhalers and devices include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,135; U.S. Pat. No. 5,740,794; U.S. Pat. No. 5,775,320; U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,049; U.S. Pat. No. 3,906,950; U.S. Pat. No. 4,013,075; U.S. Pat. No. 4,069,819; U.S. Pat. No. 4,995,385; U.S. Pat. No. 5,522,385; U.S. Pat. No. 4,668,218; U.S. Pat. No. 4,667,668; U.S. Pat. No. 4,805,811 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,388,572. There are two major designs of dry powder inhalers. One design is a metering device in which a reservoir for the drug is place within the device and the patient adds a dose of the drug into the inhalation chamber. The second design is a factory-metered device in which each individual dose has been manufactured in a separate container. Both systems depend on the formulation of the drug into small particles of MMAD from 1 μm and about 5 μm and often involve co-formulation with larger excipient particles such as, but not limited to, lactose. Drug powder is placed in the inhalation chamber (either by device metering or by breakage of a factory-metered dosage) and the inspiratory flow of the patient accelerates the powder out of the device and into the oral cavity. Non-laminar flow characteristics of the powder path cause the excipient-drug aggregates to decompose, and the mass of the large excipient particles causes their impaction at the back of the throat, while the smaller drug particles are deposited deep in the lungs. In preferred embodiments, a compound of Formulas I-IX, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is delivered as a dry powder using either type of dry powder inhaler as described herein, wherein the MMAD of the dry powder, exclusive of any excipients, is predominantly in the range of 1 μm to about 5 μm.
In another embodiment, a compound of Formulas I-IX is delivered as a dry powder using a metered dose inhaler. Non-limiting examples of metered dose inhalers and devices include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,261,538; U.S. Pat. No. 5,544,647; U.S. Pat. No. 5,622,163; U.S. Pat. No. 4,955,371; U.S. Pat. No. 3,565,070; U.S. Pat. No. 3,361,306 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,116,234. In preferred embodiments, a compound of Formulas I-IX, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is delivered as a dry powder using a metered dose inhaler wherein the MMAD of the dry powder, exclusive of any excipients, is predominantly in the range of about 1-5 μm.
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.
The formulations are presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.
Further provided are veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefor.
Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired route.
Compounds herein are used to provide controlled release pharmaceutical formulations containing as active ingredient one or more of the compounds (“controlled release formulations”) in which the release of the active ingredient are controlled and regulated to allow less frequency dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile of a given active ingredient.
Effective dose of active ingredient depends at least on the nature of the condition being treated, toxicity, whether the compound is being used prophylactically (lower doses) or against an active viral infection, the method of delivery, and the pharmaceutical formulation, and will be determined by the clinician using conventional dose escalation studies. It can be expected to be from about 0.0001 to about 100 mg/kg body weight per day; typically, from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day; more typically, from about 0.01 to about 5 mg/kg body weight per day; most typically, from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day. For example, the daily candidate dose for an adult human of approximately 70 kg body weight will range from 1 mg to 1000 mg, preferably between 5 mg and 500 mg, and may take the form of single or multiple doses.
Routes of Administration
One or more of the compounds (herein referred to as the active ingredients) are administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, rectal, nasal, pulmonary, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), and the like. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient. An advantage of the compounds herein is that they are orally bioavailable and can be dosed orally.
Combination Therapy
Compositions are also used in combination with other active ingredients. For the treatment of Pneumovirinae virus infections, preferably, the other active therapeutic agent is active against Pneumovirinae virus infections, particularly respiratory syncytial virus infections. Non-limiting examples of these other active therapeutic agents are ribavirin, palivizumab, motavizumab, RSV-IGIV (RespiGam®), MEDI-557, A-60444 (also known as RSV604), MDT-637, BMS-433771, ALN-RSV0, ALX-0171 and mixtures thereof.
Many of the infections of the Pneumovirinae viruses are respiratory infections. Therefore, additional active therapeutics used to treat respiratory symptoms and sequelae of infection may be used in combination with the compounds of Formulas I-IX. The additional agents are preferably administered orally or by direct inhalation. For example, other preferred additional therapeutic agents in combination with the compounds of Formulas I-IX for the treatment of viral respiratory infections include, but are not limited to, bronchodilators and corticosteroids.
Glucocorticoids, which were first introduced as an asthma therapy in 1950 (Carryer, Journal of Allergy, 21, 282-287, 1950), remain the most potent and consistently effective therapy for this disease, although their mechanism of action is not yet fully understood (Morris, J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 75 (1 Pt) 1-13, 1985). Unfortunately, oral glucocorticoid therapies are associated with profound undesirable side effects such as truncal obesity, hypertension, glaucoma, glucose intolerance, acceleration of cataract formation, bone mineral loss, and psychological effects, all of which limit their use as long-term therapeutic agents (Goodman and Gilman, 10th edition, 2001). A solution to systemic side effects is to deliver steroid drugs directly to the site of inflammation. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have been developed to mitigate the severe adverse effects of oral steroids. Non-limiting examples of corticosteroids that may be used in combinations with the compounds of Formulas I-IX are dexamethasone, dexamethasone sodium phosphate, fluorometholone, fluorometholone acetate, loteprednol, loteprednol etabonate, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, fludrocortisones, triamcinolone, triamcinolone acetonide, betamethasone, beclomethasone diproprionate, methylprednisolone, fluocinolone, fluocinolone acetonide, flunisolide, fluocortin-21-butylate, flumethasone, flumetasone pivalate, budesonide, halobetasol propionate, mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, ciclesonide; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
Other anti-inflammatory agents working through anti-inflammatory cascade mechanisms are also useful as additional therapeutic agents in combination with the compounds of Formulas I-IX for the treatment of viral respiratory infections. Applying “anti-inflammatory signal transduction modulators” (referred to in this text as AISTM), like phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. PDE-4, PDE-5, or PDE-7 specific), transcription factor inhibitors (e.g. blocking NFκB through IKK inhibition), or kinase inhibitors (e.g. blocking P38 MAP, JNK, PI3K, EGFR or Syk) is a logical approach to switching off inflammation as these small molecules target a limited number of common intracellular pathways—those signal transduction pathways that are critical points for the anti-inflammatory therapeutic intervention (see review by P. J. Barnes, 2006). These non-limiting additional therapeutic agents include: 5-(2,4-Difluoro-phenoxy)-1-isobutyl-1H-indazole-6-carboxylic acid (2-dimethylamino-ethyl)-amide (P38 Map kinase inhibitor ARRY-797); 3-Cyclopropylmethoxy-N-(3,5-dichloro-pyridin-4-yl)-4-difluorormethoxy-benzamide (PDE-4 inhibitor Roflumilast); 4-[2-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenyl-ethyl[-pyridine (PDE-4 inhibitor CDP-840); N-(3,5-dichloro-4-pyridinyl)-4-(difluoromethoxy)-8-Rmethylsulfonyl)amino]-1-dibenzofurancarboxamide (PDE-4 inhibitor Oglemilast); N-(3,5-Dichloro-pyridin-4-yl)-2-[1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl]-2-oxo-acetamide (PDE-4 inhibitor AWD 12-281); 8-Methoxy-2-trifluoromethyl-quinoline-5-carboxylic acid (3,5-dichloro-1-oxy-pyridin-4-yl)-amide (PDE-4 inhibitor Sch 351591); 4-[5-(4-Fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methanesulfinyl-phenyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl]-pyridine (P38 inhibitor SB-203850); 4-[4-(4-Fluoro-phenyl)-1-(3-phenyl-propyl)-5-pyridin-4-yl-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-but-3-yn-1-ol (P38 inhibitor RWJ-67657); 4-Cyano-4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid 2-diethylamino-ethyl ester (2-diethyl-ethyl ester prodrug of Cilomilast, PDE-4 inhibitor); (3-Chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-[7-methoxy-6-(3-morpholin-4-yl-propoxy)-quinazolin-4-yl]-amine (Gefitinib, EGFR inhibitor); and 4-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-N-[4-methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-yl-pyrimidin-2-ylamino)-phenyl]-benzamide (Imatinib, EGFR inhibitor).
Combinations comprising inhaled β2-adrenoreceptor agonist bronchodilators such as formoterol, albuterol or salmeterol with the compounds of Formulas I-IX are also suitable, but non-limiting, combinations useful for the treatment of respiratory viral infections.
Combinations of inhaled β2-adrenoreceptor agonist bronchodilators such as formoterol or salmeterol with ICS's are also used to treat both the bronchoconstriction and the inflammation (Symbicort® and Advair®, respectively). The combinations comprising these ICS and β2-adrenoreceptor agonist combinations along with the compounds of Formulas I-IX are also suitable, but non-limiting, combinations useful for the treatment of respiratory viral infections.
For the treatment or prophylaxis of pulmonary broncho-constriction, anticholinergics are of potential use and, therefore, useful as an additional therapeutic agents in combination with the compounds of Formulas I-IX for the treatment of viral respiratory infections. These anticholinergics include, but are not limited to, antagonists of the muscarinic receptor (particularly of the M3 subtype) which have shown therapeutic efficacy in man for the control of cholinergic tone in COPD (Witek, 1999); 1-{4-Hydroxy-1-[3,3,3-tris-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-propionyl]-pyrrolidine-2-carbonyl}-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (1-methyl-piperidin-4-ylmethyl)-amide; 3-[3-(2-Diethylamino-acetoxy)-2-phenyl-propionyloxy]-8-isopropyl-8-methyl-8-azonia-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane (Ipratropium-N,N-diethylglycinate); 1-Cyclohexyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-isoquinoline-2-carboxylic acid 1-aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl ester (Solifenacin); 2-Hydroxymethyl-4-methanesulfinyl-2-phenyl-butyric acid 1-aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl ester (Revatropate); 2-{1-[2-(2,3-Dihydro-benzofuran-5-yl)-ethyl]-pyrrolidin-3-yl}-2,2-diphenyl-acetamide (Darifenacin); 4-Azepan-1-yl-2,2-diphenyl-butyramide (Buzepide); 7-[3-(2-Diethylamino-acetoxy)-2-phenyl-propionyloxy]-9-ethyl-9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azonia-tricyclo[3.3.1.02,4]nonane (Oxitropium-N,N-diethylglycinate); 7-[2-(2-Diethylamino-acetoxy)-2,2-di-thiophen-2-yl-acetoxy]-9,9-dimethyl-3-oxa-9-azonia-tricyclo[3.3.1.02,4]nonane (Tiotropium-N,N-diethylglycinate); Dimethylamino-acetic acid 2-(3-diisopropylamino-1-phenyl-propyl)-4-methyl-phenyl ester (Tolterodine-N,N-dimethylglycinate); 3-[4,4-Bis-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-2-oxo-imidazolidin-1-yl]-1-methyl-1-(2-oxo-2-pyridin-2-yl-ethyl)-pyrrolidinium; 1-[1-(3-Fluoro-benzyl)-piperidin-4-yl]-4,4-bis-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-imidazolidin-2-one; 1-Cyclooctyl-3-(3-methoxy-1-aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-1-phenyl-prop-2-yn-1-ol; 3-[2-(2-Diethylamino-acetoxy)-2,2-di-thiophen-2-yl-acetoxy]-1-(3-phenoxy-propyl)-1-azonia-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Aclidinium-N,N-diethylglycinate); or (2-Diethylamino-acetoxy)-di-thiophen-2-yl-acetic acid 1-methyl-1-(2-phenoxy-ethyl)-piperidin-4-yl ester.
The compounds of Formulas I-IX may also be combined with mucolytic agents to treat both the infection and symptoms of respiratory infections. A non-limiting example of a mucolytic agent is ambroxol. Similarly, the compounds of Formulas I-IX may be combined with expectorants to treat both the infection and symptoms of respiratory infections. A non-limiting example of an expectorant is guaifenesin.
Nebulized hypertonic saline is used to improve immediate and long-term clearance of small airways in patients with lung diseases (Kuzik, J. Pediatrics 2007, 266). The compounds of Formulas I-IX may also be combined with nebulized hypertonic saline particularly when the Pneumovirinae virus infection is complicated with bronchiolitis. The combination of the compounds of Formulas I-IX with hypertonic saline may also comprise any of the additional agents discussed above. In one embodiment, nebulized about 3% hypertonic saline is used.
It is also possible to combine any compound with one or more additional active therapeutic agents in a unitary dosage form for simultaneous or sequential administration to a patient. The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations.
Co-administration of a compound herein with one or more other active therapeutic agents generally refers to simultaneous or sequential administration of a compound and one or more other active therapeutic agents, such that therapeutically effective amounts of the compound and one or more other active therapeutic agents are both present in the body of the patient.
Co-administration includes administration of unit dosages of the compounds before or after administration of unit dosages of one or more other active therapeutic agents, for example, administration of the compounds within seconds, minutes, or hours of the administration of one or more other active therapeutic agents. For example, a unit dose of a compound can be administered first, followed within seconds or minutes by administration of a unit dose of one or more other active therapeutic agents. Alternatively, a unit dose of one or more other therapeutic agents can be administered first, followed by administration of a unit dose of a compound within seconds or minutes. In some cases, it may be desirable to administer a unit dose of a compound first, followed, after a period of hours (e.g., 1-12 hours), by administration of a unit dose of one or more other active therapeutic agents. In other cases, it may be desirable to administer a unit dose of one or more other active therapeutic agents first, followed, after a period of hours (e.g., 1-12 hours), by administration of a unit dose of a compound herein.
The combination therapy may provide “synergy” and “synergistic”, i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g. in separate tablets, pills or capsules, or by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e. serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together. A synergistic anti-viral effect denotes an antiviral effect which is greater than the predicted purely additive effects of the individual compounds of the combination.
In still yet another embodiment, the present application provides a method of treating Pneumovirinae virus infection in a human, the method comprising administering to the human a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, and/or ester thereof.

Metabolites of the Compounds
Also falling within the scope herein are the in vivo metabolic products of the compounds described herein, to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification and the like of the administered compound, primarily due to enzymatic processes. Accordingly, included are novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof. Such products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g. 14C or 3H) compound, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds even if they possess no HSV antiviral activity of their own.
Recipes and methods for determining stability of compounds in surrogate gastrointestinal secretions are known. Compounds are defined herein as stable in the gastrointestinal tract where less than about 50 mole percent of the protected groups are deprotected in surrogate intestinal or gastric juice upon incubation for 1 hour at 37° C. Simply because the compounds are stable to the gastrointestinal tract does not mean that they cannot be hydrolyzed in vivo. The prodrugs typically will be stable in the digestive system but may be substantially hydrolyzed to the parental drug in the digestive lumen, liver, lung or other metabolic organ, or within cells in general. As used herein, a prodrug is understood to be a compound that is chemically designed to efficiently liberate the parent drug after overcoming biological barriers to oral delivery.

General Schemes
Scheme 1 shows a general synthesis of compounds of the invention beginning with a lithium-halogen exchange (e.g. n-BuLi) reaction with an appropriate nucleobase S1b (X1=halogen, —O-alkyl, —O-Aryl, —S-Alkyl, —S-Aryl, NH2, NHRa, NRa2; X2═Br, I) followed by addition to the lactone S1a. Reduction of the pendant 1′ hydroxyl group under Lewis acidic conditions (e.g. BF3·Et2O, Et3SiH) generates intermediate S1c. Standard alterations of the hydroxyl protecting groups afford the appropriately protected intermediate S1d. The 5′ hydroxyl group of S1d is then converted to the corresponding iodide (e.g. I2, PPh3), which is then treated with basic conditions (e.g. DBU) to effect an elimination reaction generating intermediate S1e. Oxidation of the olefin S1e and azide addition (e.g. ICl, NaN3) affords intermediate S1f. Displacement of the iodide S1f with an oxygen nucleophile (e.g. MCPBA, MCBA) generates S1g, and conversion of the X1 group to an —NH2 (e.g. NH4OH) yields the final compounds of the type S1h.
Scheme 2 shows a general synthesis of intermediates of the invention beginning with conversion of the 5′ hydroxyl group S1d to the aldehyde S2a under oxidative conditions (e.g. EDCI). Condensation of the corresponding enolate with formaldehyde (e.g. CH2O, NaOH) and reduction (e.g. NaBH4) yields intermediate S2b. Sequential selective protection of the hydroxyl moieties with orthogonal protecting groups affords intermediate S2c. Conversion of the hydroxyl group S2c to the aldehyde under oxidative conditions (e.g. EDCI) generates intermediate S2d. Elaboration of the aldehyde S2d to the nitrile S2e can be effected through oxime formation (e.g. NH2OH), and elimination of the oxime alcohol (e.g. CDI). Conversion of the X1 group to an —NH2 (e.g. NH4OH) yields the final compounds of the type S2f.
Scheme 3 shows a general synthesis of intermediates of the invention through elaboration of the alcohol S2c. Deoxygenatrion of the alcohol S2c (e.g. PPh3, I2, then Bu3SnH, AIBN), and conversion of the X1 group to an —NH2 (e.g. NH4OH) yields the final compounds of the type S3a. Methylation of the alcohol S2c (e.g. MeI), and conversion of the X1 group to an —NH2 (e.g. NH4OH) yields the final compounds of the type S3b. Chlorination of the alcohol S2c (e.g. POCl3), and conversion of the X1 group to an —NH2 (e.g. NH4OH) yields the final compounds of the type S3c. Fluorination of the alcohol S2c (e.g. DAST), and conversion of the X1 group to an —NH2 (e.g. NH4OH) yields the final compounds of the type S3d.
Scheme 4 shows a general synthesis of intermediates of the invention through elaboration of the aldehyde S2d. Olefination of the aldehyde S2d (e.g. Ph3PCH2), and conversion of the X1 group to an —NH2 (e.g. NH4OH) yields the final compounds of the type S4a. Reduction of the olefin (e.g. H2, Pd/C) yields the final compounds of the type S4b. Difluorination of the aldehyde S2d (e.g. DAST), and conversion of the X1 group to an —NH2 (e.g. NH4OH) yields the final compounds of the type S4c. Cyclopropination of the olefin S4a (e.g. CH2N2), and conversion of the X1 group to an —NH2 (e.g. NH4OH) yields the final compounds of the type S4d.
Scheme 5 shows a general synthesis of intermediates of the invention through elaboration of the triflate S5a (prepared according to WO2013138236A1, WO2012037038A1, WO2012012776A1). Substitution of the triflate S5a with a fluorine nucleophile (e.g. CsF), hydrolysis of the methoxy acetal (e.g. TFA, H2O), and oxidation (e.g. PDC) yields the compound of the type S5b suitable for coupling with the nucleobase. Substitution of the triflate S5a with a chlorine nucleophile (e.g. LiCl), hydrolysis of the methoxy acetal (e.g. TFA, H2O), and oxidation (e.g. PDC) yields the compound of the type S5c suitable for coupling with the nucleobase. Substitution of the triflate S5a with an azide nucleophile (e.g. NaN3), hydrolysis of the methoxy acetal (e.g. TFA, H2O), and oxidation (e.g. PDC) yields the compound of the type S5d suitable for coupling with the nucleobase. Substitution of the triflate S5a with a cyanide nucleophile (e.g. NaCN), hydrolysis of the methoxy acetal (e.g. TFA, H2O), and oxidation (e.g. PDC) yields the compound of the type S5e, suitable for coupling with the nucleobase.
Scheme 6 shows a general synthesis of intermediates of the invention through elaboration of the base S6a (prepared according to WO2008073785A2). Amination (e.g. NH3) of the S6a base yields S6b, which is acylated (e.g. Ac2O) to generate S6c. Addition of a nuceleophilic fluorine (e.g. CsF) affords S6d, and removal of the acyl group (e.g. NH3) yield the final compound of the type S6e, suitable for coupling to the lactone.
Scheme 7 shows a general synthesis of compounds of the invention involving synthesis of phosphorylated analogs of the type S7b.
Scheme 8 shows a general synthesis of compounds of the invention involving synthesis of phosphorylated analogs of the type S7b.
Scheme 9 shows a general synthesis of compounds of the invention involving synthesis of phosphorylated analogs of the type S9c.

Another aspect of the invention relates to methods of inhibiting viral infections, comprising the step of treating a sample or subject suspected of needing such inhibition with a composition of the invention.
Within the context of the invention samples suspected of containing a virus include natural or man-made materials such as living organisms; tissue or cell cultures; biological samples such as biological material samples (blood, serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, tears, sputum, saliva, tissue samples, and the like); laboratory samples; food, water, or air samples; bioproduct samples such as extracts of cells, particularly recombinant cells synthesizing a desired glycoprotein; and the like. Typically the sample will be suspected of containing an organism which induces a viral infection, frequently a pathogenic organism such as a tumor virus. Samples can be contained in any medium including water and organic solvent\water mixtures. Samples include living organisms such as humans, and manmade materials such as cell cultures.
If desired, the anti-viral activity of a compound of the invention after application of the composition can be observed by any method including direct and indirect methods of detecting such activity. Quantitative, qualitative, and semiquantitative methods of determining such activity are all contemplated. Typically one of the screening methods described above are applied, however, any other method such as observation of the physiological properties of a living organism are also applicable.
The antiviral activity of a compound of the invention can be measured using standard screening protocols that are known. For example, the antiviral activity of a compound can be measured using the following general protocols.
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Antiviral Activity and Cytotoxicity Assays
Anti-RSV Activity
Antiviral activity against RSV is determined using an infectious cytopathic cell protection assay in HEp-2 cells. In this assay, compounds inhibiting viral infection and/or replication produce a cytoprotective effect against the virus-induced cell killing that can be quantified using a cell viability reagent. The techniques used here are novel adaptations of methods described in published literature (Chapman et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007, 51 (9):3346-53.)
HEp-2 cells are obtained from ATCC (Manassas, Va.) and maintained in MEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells are passaged twice a week and kept at subconfluent stage. Commercial stock of RSV strain A2 (Advanced Biotechnologies, Columbia, Md.) is titered before compound testing to determine the appropriate dilution of the virus stock that generates desirable cytopathic effect in HEp-2 cells.
For antiviral tests, HEp-2 cells are grown in large cell culture flasks to near confluency but not fully so. The compounds to be tested are prediluted in DMSO in 384-well compound dilution plates, either in an 8 or 40 sample per plate standardized dose response format. 3-fold serial dilution increments of each test compound are prepared in the plates and test samples are transferred via acoustic transfer apparatus (Echo, Labcyte) at 100 nl per well into cell culture assay 384-well plates. Each compound dilution is transferred in single or quadruplicate samples into dry assay plates, which are stored until assay is ready to go. The positive and negative controls are laid out in opposite on ends of the plate in vertical blocks (1 column).
Subsequently, an infectious mixture is prepared using an appropriate dilution of virus stock previously determined by titration with cells at a density of 50,000/ml and 20 uL/well is added to test plates w/compounds via automation (uFlow, Biotek). Each plate includes negative and positive controls (16 replicates each) to create 0% and 100% virus inhibition standards, respectively. Following the infection with RSV, testing plates are incubated for 4 days in a 37° C. cell culture incubator. After the incubation, a cell viability reagent, Cell TiterGlo (Promega, Madison, Wis.) is added to the assay plates, which are incubated briefly, and a luminescent readout is measured (Envision, Perkin Elmer) in all the assay plates. The RSV-induced cytopathic effect, percentage inhibition, is determined from the levels of remaining cell viability. These numbers are calculated for each tested concentration relative to the 0% and 100% inhibition controls, and the EC50 value for each compound is determined by non-linear regression as a concentration inhibiting the RSV-induced cytopathic effect by 50%. Various potent anti-RSV tool compounds are used as positive controls for antiviral activity.
Cytotoxicity Assay in HEp-2 Cells
Cytotoxicity of tested compounds is determined in uninfected HEp-2 cells in parallel with the antiviral activity using the cell viability reagent in a similar fashion as described before for other cell types (Cihlar et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008,52(2):655-65.). The same protocol as for the determination of antiviral activity is used for the measurement of compound cytotoxicity except that the cells are not infected with RSV. Instead, an uninfected cell mixture at the same density is added at 20 ul/well to plates containing prediluted compounds, also at 100 nl/sample. Assay plates are then incubated for 4 days followed by a cell viability test using the same CellTiter Glo reagent addition and measurement of luminescent readouts. Untreated cell and cells treated at 2 uM puromycin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) serve as 100% and 0% cell viability control, respectively. The percent of cell viability is calculated for each tested compound concentration relative to the 0% and 100% controls and the CC50 value is determined by non-linear regression as a compound concentration reducing the cell viability by 50%.
Cytotoxicity Assay in MT-4 Cells
The MT-4 cell line was obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Germantown, Md.) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, Calif., Cat #9160) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 units/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-Glutamine. The MT-4 cells were passaged twice per week to maintain cell densities below 0.6×106 cells/mL. Complete RPMI-1640 media containing 100× concentrations of 3-fold serially diluted compound, ranging from 26 nM to 530 μM, were stamped in quadruplicate into black 384-well plates. After compound addition, 2×103 MT-4 cells were added to each well using a MicroFlo liquid dispenser (BioTek, Winooski, Vt.) and the cells were cultured for 5 days at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 incubator. Following the incubation the cells were allowed to equilibrate to 25° C. and cell viability was determined by adding 25 μL of Cell-Titer Glo viability reagent. The mixture was incubated for 10 minutes at 25° C., and the luminescence signal was quantified on a Victor Luminescence plate reader. The CC50 value is defined as the concentration of compound that reduces cell viability by 50% as determined by the Cell-Titer Glo signal. The data were analyzed using Pipeline Pilot Plate Data Analytics Collection software (Version 7.0, Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.). CC50 values were calculated from a non-linear regression analysis using a 4-parameter sigmoidal dose-response equation: Y=Bottom+(Top-Bottom)/(1+10^[(LogCC50-X)*HillSlope]) where the Top and Bottom were fixed at 100% and 0% cell viability, respectively. CC50 values were calculated as the average± standard deviation of 3 independent experiments.

RSV RNP Preparation
RSV ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were prepared from a method modified from Mason et al (1). HEp-2 cells were plated at a density of 7.1×104 cells/cm2 in MEM+10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and allowed to attach overnight at 37° C. (5% CO2). Following attachment, the cells were infected with RSV A2 (MOI=5) in 35 mL MEM+2% FBS. At 20 hours post-infection, the media was replaced with MEM+2% FBS supplemented with 2 m/mL actinomycin D and returned to 37° C. for one hour. The cells were then washed once with PBS and treated with 35 mL of PBS+250 m/mL lyso-lecithin for one minute, after which all liquid was aspirated. The cells were harvested by scrapping them into 1.2 mL of buffer A [50 mM TRIS acetate (pH 8.0), 100 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM DTT and 2 m/mL actinomycin D] and lysed by repeated passage through an 18 gauge needle (10 times). The cell lysate was placed in ice for 10 minutes and then centrifuged at 2400 g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The supernatant (S1) was removed and the pellet (P1) was disrupted in 600 uL of Buffer B [10 mM TRIS acetate (pH 8.0), 10 mM potassium acetate and 1.5 mM MgCl2] supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 by repeated passage through an 18 gauge needle (10 times). The resuspended pellet was placed in ice for 10 minutes and then centrifuged at 2400 g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The supernatant (S2) was removed and the pellet (P2) was disrupted in 600 uL of Buffer B supplemented with 0.5% deoxycholate and 0.1% Tween 40. The resuspended pellet was placed in ice for 10 minutes and then centrifuged at 2400 g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The supernatant (S3) fraction, containing the enriched RSV RNP complexes, was collected and the protein concentration determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm. Aliquoted RSV RNP S3 fractions were stored at −80° C.
RSV RNP Assay
Transcription reactions contained 25 μg of crude RSV RNP complexes in 30 μL of reaction buffer [50 mM TRIS-acetate (pH 8.0), 120 mM potassium acetate, 5% glycerol, 4.5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM DTT, 2 mM ethyleneglycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 50 μg/mL BSA, 2.5 U RNasin (Promega), ATP, GTP, UTP, CTP and 1.5 uCi [α-32P] NTP (3000 Ci/mmol)]. The radiolabled nucleotide used in the transcription assay was selected to match the nucleotide analog being evaluated for inhibition of RSV RNP transcription. Cold, competitive NTP was added at a final concentration of one-half its Km (ATP=20 μM, GTP=12.5 μM, UTP=6 μM and CTP=2 μM). The three remaining nucleotides were added at a final concentration of 100 μM.
To determine whether nucleotide analogs inhibited RSV RNP transcription, compounds were added using a 6 step serial dilution in 5-fold increments. Following a 90 minute incubation at 30° C., the RNP reactions were stopped with 350 μL of Qiagen RLT lysis buffer and the RNA was purified using a Qiagen RNeasy 96 kit. Purified RNA was denatured in RNA sample loading buffer (Sigma) at 65° C. for 10 minutes and run on a 1.2% agarose/MOPS gel containing 2M formaldehyde. The agarose gel was dried and exposed to a Storm phosphorimager screen and developed using a Storm phosphorimager (GE Healthcare). The concentration of compound that reduced total radiolabled transcripts by 50% (IC50) was calculated by non-linear regression analysis of two replicates.
