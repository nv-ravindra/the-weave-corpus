The invention relates to novel heteroaryl carboxamides, processes for their preparation, and their use for producing medicaments for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases and for improving perception, concentration, learning and/or memory.
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) form a large family of ion channels which are activated by the messenger acetylcholine which is produced in the body (Galzi and Changeux, Neuropharmacol. 1995, 34, 563-582). A functional nAChR consists of five subunits which may be different (certain combinations of α1-9 and β1-4,γ,δ,ϵ subunits) or identical (α7-9). This leads to the formation of a diversity of subtypes which differ in the distribution in the muscles, the nervous system and other organs (McGehee and Role, Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995, 57, 521-546). Activation of nAChR leads to influx of cations into the cell and to stimulation of nerve cells or muscle cells. Selective activation of individual nAChR subtypes restricts this stimulation to the cell types which have the corresponding subtype and is thus able to avoid unwanted side effects such as, for example, stimulation of nAChR in the muscles. Clinical experiments with nicotine and experiments in various animal models indicate that central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are involved in learning and memory processes (e.g. Rezvani and Levin, Biol. Psychiatry 2001, 49, 258-267). Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the alpha7 subtype (α7 nAChR) have a particularly high concentration in regions of the brain which are important for learning and memory, such as the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex (Séguéla et al., J. Neurosci. 1993, 13, 596-604). The α7 nAChR has a particularly high permeability for calcium ions, increases glutamatergic neurotransmission, influences the growth of axons and, in this way, modulates neuronal plasticity (Broide and Leslie, Mol. Neurobiol. 1999, 20, 1-16).

in which R1 has the abovementioned meaning,
are reacted with a compound of the general formula (III) in which
the ring A, R2 and R3 have the abovementioned meaning, and
X is hydroxyl or a suitable leaving group,
in an inert solvent, where appropriate in the presence of a condensing agent, and where appropriate in the presence of a base.
If X is a leaving group, chloro, mesyloxy and isobutyloxycarbonyloxy, especially chloro, are preferred.
Examples of inert solvents are halohydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, trichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, 1,2-di-chloroethane or trichloroethylene, ethers such as diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, glycol dimethyl ether or diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, hydrocarbons such as benzene, xylene, toluene, hexane, cyclohexane or petroleum fractions, or other solvents such as nitromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile or pyridine, with preference for tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or chloroform.

The process of the invention is preferably carried out in a temperature range from room temperature to 50° C. under atmospheric pressure.
The compounds of the general formulae (II) and (III) are known or can be synthesized by known processes from the appropriate precursors (cf., for example, “Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry”, Katritzki et al., editors; Elsevier, 1996).
Thus, for example, quinolinecarboxylic acids [X1 is hydroxyl and the ring A is [b]pyrido in compounds of the general formula (III)] can be obtained by oxidizing the corresponding methylquinolines (Miller et al. Chem. Ber. 1890, 23, 2263 ff.) or the corresponding aldehydes (Howitz et al. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1913, 396, 37) with suitable oxidizing agents such as, for example, Cr2O3.
A further possibility is, for example, to obtain 6-quinolinecarboxylic acids by reacting 4-aminobenzoic acid with suitable enones (John et al. J. Prakt. Chem. 1925, 111, 95), as illustrated by way of example by the following synthetic scheme.
An alternative possibility is to prepare quinolinecarboxamides of the invention by reacting the corresponding iodine- and amino-substituted benzamides in the presence of suitable catalysts with allyl alcohols and propargyl alcohols (cf. Kuo et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991, 32, 569), as illustrated by way of example by the following synthetic scheme.
The compounds of the invention of the general formula (I) are suitable for use as medicaments for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases in humans and/or animals.
The compounds of the invention show a valuable range of pharmacological effects which could not have been predicted.
They are notable as ligands, especially agonists, at the α7 nAChR.
The compounds of the invention can, because of their pharmacological properties, be employed alone or in combination with other active ingredients for the treatment and/or prevention of cognitive impairments, especially of Alzheimer's disease. Because of their selective effect as α7 nAChR agonists, the compounds of the invention are particularly suitable for improving perception, concentration, learning or memory, especially after cognitive impairments like those occurring for example in situations/diseases/syndromes such as mild cognitive impairment, age-associated learning and memory impairments, age-associated memory loss, vascular dementia, craniocerebral trauma, stroke, dementia occurring after strokes (post-stroke dementia), post-traumatic craniocerebral trauma, general concentration impairments, concentration impairments in children with learning and memory problems, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, dementia with degeneration of the frontal lobes, including Pick's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, progressive nuclear palsy, dementia with corticobasal degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, thalamic degeneration, Creutzfeld-Jacob dementia, HIV dementia, schizophrenia, schizophrenia with dementia or Korsakoffs psychosis.
The compounds of the invention can be employed alone or in combination with other medicaments for the prophylaxis and treatment of acute and/or chronic pain (for a classification, see “Classification of Chronic Pain, Descriptions of Chronic Pain Syndromes and Definitions of Pain Terms”, 2nd edition, Meskey and Begduk, editors; IASP Press, Seattle, 1994), especially for the treatment of cancer-induced pain and chronic neuropathic pain like, for example, that associated with diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral nerve damage, central pain (for example as a consequence of cerebral ischemia) and trigeminal neuralgia, and other chronic pain such as, for example, lumbago, backache (low back pain) or rheumatic pain. In addition, these substances are also suitable for the therapy of primary acute pain of any origin and of secondary states of pain resulting therefrom, and for the therapy of states of pain which were formerly acute and have become chronic.
The in vitro effect of the compounds of the invention can be shown in the following assays:
1. Determination of the Affinity of Test Substances for α7 nAChR by Inhibition of [3H]-Methyllycaconitine Binding to Rat Brain Membranes
The [3H]-methyllycaconitine binding assay is a modification of the method described by Davies et al. (Neuropharmacol, 1999, 38, 679-690).
Rat brain tissue (hippocampus or whole brain) is homogenized in homogenization buffer (10% w/v) (0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.01% (w/v) NaN3, pH 7.4, 4° C.) at 600 rpm in a glass homogenizer. The homogenate is centrifuged (1000×g, 4° C., 10 min) and the supernatant is removed. The pellet is resuspended (20% w/v) and the suspension is centrifuged (1000×g, 4° C., 10 min). The two supernatants are combined and centrifuged (15 000×g, 4° C., 30 min). This pellet is referred to as the P2 fraction.
The P2 pellet is twice washed with binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) and centrifuged (15 000×g, 4° C., 30 min).
The P2 membranes are resuspended in binding buffer and incubated in a volume of 250 μl (amount of membrane protein 0.1-0.5 mg) in the presence of 1-5 nM [3H]-methyllycaconitine, 0.1% (w/v) BSA (bovine serum albumin) and various concentrations of the test substance at 21° C. for 2.5 h. Nonspecific binding is determined by incubation in the presence of 1 μM α-bungarotoxin or 100 μM nicotine or 10 μM MLA (methyllycaconitine).
The incubation is stopped by adding 4 ml PBS (20 mM Na2HPO4, 5 mM KH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 4° C.) and filtering through type A/E glass fibre filters (Gelman Sciences) which have previously been placed in 0.3% (v/v) polyethyleneimine (PEI) for 3 h. The filters are washed twice with 4 ml of PBS (4° C.), and the bound radioactivity is determined by scintillation measurement. All the assays are carried out in triplicate. The dissociation constant Ki of the test substance was determined from the IC50 of the compounds (concentration of the test substance at which 50% of the ligand bound to the receptor is displaced), the dissociation constant KD and the concentration L of [3H]-methyllycaconitine (Ki=IC50/(1+L/KD)).
In place of [3H]-methyllycaconitine it is also possible to employ other α7 nAChR-selective radioligands such as, for example, [125I]-α-bungarotoxin or nonselective nAChR radioligands together with inhibitors of other nAChRs.
The suitability of the compounds of the invention for the treatment of cognitive impairments can be shown in the following animal models:
2. Object Recognition Test
The object recognition test is a memory test. It measures the ability of rats (and mice) to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar objects.
The test is carried out as described (Blokland et al., Neuro Report 1998, 9, 4205-4208; Ennaceur, A., Delacour, J., Behav. Brain Res. 1988, 31, 47-59; Ennaceur, A., Meliani, K., Psychopharmacology 1992, 109, 321-330; and Prickaerts et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 337, 125-136).
In a first run, a rat is confronted in an otherwise empty observation arena of relatively large size by two identical objects. The rat will investigate, i.e. sniff round and touch, both objects extensively. In a second run, after an interval of 24 hours, the rat is put in the observation arena again. One of the familiar objects has now been replaced by a new, unfamiliar object. If a rat recognizes the familiar object, it will concentrate on investigating the unfamiliar object. However, after 24 hours, a rat has normally forgotten which object it investigated in the first run, and it will therefore inspect both objects to the same extent. Administration of a substance with a learning- and memory-improving effect may lead to a rat recognizing the object seen in the first run 24 hours previously as familiar. It will investigate the new, unfamiliar object in more detail than the familiar one. This memory ability is expressed in a discrimination index. A discrimination index of zero means that the rat investigates both objects, the old and the new, for equal times; that is to say it has not recognized the old object and reacts to both objects as if they were unfamiliar and new. A discrimination index greater than zero means that the rat inspects the new object for longer than the old one; that is to say the rat has recognized the old object.
3. Social Recognition Test:
The social recognition test is a test to examine the learning- or memory-improving effect of test substances.
Adult rats housed in groups are placed singly in test cages 30 minutes before the start of the test. Four minutes before the start of the test, the test animal is put in an observation box. After this adaptation time, a juvenile animal is put in with the test animal and the total time for which the adult animal investigates the juvenile animal is measured for 2 minutes (trial 1). All behaviors clearly directed at the young animal are measured, i.e. anogenital inspection, pursuit and fur care, during which the old animal is no further than 1 cm from the young animal. The juvenile animal is then taken out, and the adult is left in its test cage (for 24-hour retention, the animal is returned to its home cage). The test animal is treated with test substance before or after the first test. Depending on the timing of the treatment, the learning or the storage of the information about the young animal can be influenced by the substance. After a fixed period (retention), the test is repeated (trial 2). A larger difference between the investigation times measured in trials 1 and 2 means that the adult animal has remembered the young animal better.
The compounds of the invention of the general formula (I) are suitable for use as medicaments for humans and animals.
The present invention also includes pharmaceutical preparations which, besides inert, nontoxic, pharmaceutically suitable excipients and carriers, contain one or more compounds of the general formula (I), or which consist of one or more compounds of the general formula (I), and processes for producing these preparations.
The compounds of the formula (I) are to be present in these preparations in a concentration of from 0.1 to 99.5% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 95% by weight, of the complete mixture.
Besides the compounds of the formula (I), the pharmaceutical preparations may also contain other active pharmaceutical ingredients.
The abovementioned pharmaceutical preparations can be produced by known methods in a conventional way, for example using the excipient(s) or carrier(s).
The novel active ingredients can be converted in a known manner into conventional formulations such as tablets, coated tablets, pills, granules, aerosols, syrups, emulsions, suspensions and solutions, using inert, nontoxic, pharmaceutically suitable carriers or solvents. In these cases, the therapeutically active compound should in each case be present in a concentration of about 0.5 to 90% by weight of the complete mixture, i.e. in amounts which are sufficient to reach the stated dose range.
The formulations are produced for example by extending the active ingredients with solvents and/or carriers, where appropriate with use of emulsifiers and/or dispersants, it being possible, for example when water is used as diluent, where appropriate to use organic solvents as auxiliary solvents.
Administration takes place in a conventional way, preferably orally, transdermally or parenterally, especially perlingually or intravenously. However, it can also take place by inhalation through the mouth or nose, for example with the aid of a spray, or topically via the skin.
It has generally proved advantageous to administer amounts of about 0.001 to 10 mg/kg, on oral administration preferably about 0.005 to 3 mg/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results.
It may, nevertheless, be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the stated amounts, in particular as a function of the body weight or of the mode of administration, of the individual behavior toward the medicament, the nature of its formulation and the time or interval over which administration takes place. Thus, it may be sufficient in some cases to make do with less than the aforementioned minimum amount, whereas in other cases the stated upper limit must be exceeded. Where larger amounts are administered, it may be advisable to divide these into a plurality of single doses over the day.
