The present invention relates to:
novel 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine compounds (and their derivatives);
methods for preparing same;
use thereof as precursors of the corresponding 5-sulfanylhistidines and their disulfides.
The present invention relates to novel 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine compounds and their derivatives, as well as to methods for preparing same and to the use thereof as precursors of the corresponding 5-sulfanylhistidines and their disulfides. More particularly, this invention relates to the synthesis of novel 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine compounds and their derivatives, their salts as direct precursors of the corresponding 5-sulfanylhistidines and their disulfides. The recent IUPAC nomenclature “sulfanyl” for the “—SH” group is used for the compounds described in the invention instead of the different terms used in the past in the literature, such as “thiohistidine,” “thiolhistidine” or “mercaptohistidine.”
PRIOR ART
The 5-sulfanyl-imidazole group is rarely found in nature (Caroll A. and Avrey V. M.; J. Nat. Prod.; 2009; 72; 696-699). Very few natural products comprising a 5-sulfanylhistidine backbone (methylated or not in position 3 of the imidazole ring) have been found to date (Hand C. E. and Honek J. F.; J. Nat. Prod.; 2005; 68; 293-308). Most are of bacterial or marine origin. A first example consists of the group of the adenochromines A, B and C (Ito S. and Prota G.; JCS Chem. Comm.; 1977; 251-252; Rossi F., Nardi G., Palumbo A. and Prota G.; Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1985, 80b, 843-845) and the seco-adenochromines A, B and C (Ito S., Nardi G. and Prota G.; JCS Chem. Comm.; 1976; 1042). Imbricatine, produced by Dermasterias imbricate, constitutes a second example (Pathirana C. and Andersen R. J.; J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 1986; 108, 8288-8289). The ovothiols A, B and C. (Turner E., Klevit R. E. and Shapiro B. M.; J. Biol. Chem.; 1986; 261; 13056) constitute a third example of the even more restricted group of natural products comprising a 5-sulfanylhistidine backbone methylated in position 3 (It should be noted that the position of the methyl group was initially incorrectly located on the N1 nitrogen of histidine, as demonstrated in Holler et al. JOC 1987, 4421-4423 vs. Palumba et al., THL 1982, 3207-3208). Very recently, a new indole alkaloid containing a 5-sulfanylhistidine backbone, leptoclinidamine C, was found (Caroll A. and Avrey V. M.; J. Nat. Prod.; 2009; 72; 696-699).
The biosynthesis of the ovothiols A, B and C has been described (Vogt R. N., Spies H. S. C. and Steenkamp D. J.; Eur. J. Biochem.; 2001, 268, 5229-5241). The introduction of sulfur, in position 5 of the imidazole ring of L-histidine, is carried out in the presence of the sulfoxide synthase enzyme (OvoA) as well as of ferrous iron (Fe2+) and oxygen 02. L-cysteine is used as sulfur donor leading to a sulfoxide intermediate (Braunshausen A. and Seebeck F.; JACS; 2011; 133, 1757). The latter is then transformed into ovothiol A, B or C in the presence of the sulfoxide lyase enzyme and pyridoxal phosphate, its cofactor (Mashabela G. and Seebeck F.; JCS Chem. Comm.; 2013, 7714-7716).
The preparation of 2-sulfanylhistidine and their derivatives by chemical synthesis has already been documented by the applicant (patent U.S. Ser. No. 13/121,891 and patent U.S. Ser. No. 13/500,887 A1).
The preparation of 5-sulfanylhistidine and of their derivatives by chemical synthesis turned out to be much more difficult than that of their 2-sulfanylhistidine isomers. Several synthesis strategies were considered and tested without success. To date, only 2 access routes have led only to the series of the 5-sulfanyl-3-methylhistidines. The first approach consisted of the de novo synthesis of the 5-sulfanylimidazole ring (Hopkins P. et al.; JOC; 1987, 52, 2977 and 4420) in the context of the synthesis of the ovothiols A and C in 10 to 12 steps. The second approach consisted of a nucleophilic substitution of a 5-bromoimidazole ring activated by a CHO carboxaldehyde electron-withdrawing group (Ohba M., Nishimura Y., Kato M. and Fujii T.; Tetrahedron; 1999, 55, 4999-5016) in the context of the synthesis of imbricatine. Currently, there is no known non-enzymatic chemical method for directly introducing a sulfur atom into the histidine or one of its derivatives in position 5 of the imidazole ring.
The article by SPALTENSTEIN in “The Journal of Organic Chemistry, Vol. 52, No. 14, pp. 2977-2979 discloses a method for preparing a compound 8 (p. 2978) obtained by the cyclization of the corresponding thionoamide, but the latter cannot correspond to any compound of the invention in view of the technical elements that follow.
In the same way, the article by Heng Song in Organic Letters, Vol. 15, No. 18, Sep. 20, 2013, pp. 4854-4857, entitled “Regioselectivity of the oxidative C—S Bond Formation in Ergothioneine and Ovothiol Biosyntheses,” discloses a compound ovothiol (8) (p. 4855, scheme 1) which does not correspond to any compound of the invention in view of the technical elements that follow.
Indeed, as mentioned above, page 2, lines 2-5, the initial structure of the ovothiols A, B and C was defined incorrectly in these two articles by SPALTENSTEIN and Song with regard to the positioning of the methyl group on the nitrogen of the imidazole ring of histidine. Initially located incorrectly on the N1 nitrogen of histidine, this methyl group was “repositioned” on the N3 nitrogen, as demonstrated in Holler et al. JOC 1987, 20, 4421-4423 vs. Palumba et al., THL 1982, 3207-3208).
Thus, the structure of the ovothiols A, B and C is well established following the publication by Holler et al. (JOC 1987, 20, 4421-4423), already cited in the application and accepted by the scientific community according to the following examples:
Ovothiol C: see Bailly et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2003, 11, 4623-4630, FIG. 1, p. 4624;
Ovothiols A, B and C: see De Luna et al., J. Phys. Chemistry, 2013, DOI: 10.1021/jp402514w;
Ovothiol A: see Mashabela et al., Chem. Comm., 2013, 49, 7714-7716.
Since the SPALTENSTEIN and Song documents are based on the erroneous location of the methyl in position N1, when it should be correctly located in position N3, the result is that the compound 8 of SPALTENSTEIN or Song (with the corrected structure) corresponds to the condition of formula (II) of the invention described below.
The 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine compounds and their derivatives would constitute very good precursors of 5-sulfanylhistidine and their derivatives. Since these 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine compounds and their derivatives are not known, it would therefore be necessary to have a synthesis method that makes it possible to directly introduce an acylsulfanyl group in position 5 of a histidine. To our knowledge, no such method has been described to date. This novel method for the direct introduction of an acylsulfanyl group in position 5 of histidine or of one of its derivatives would be all the more advantageous since it could be carried out without protective group and in water as a reaction solvent.
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION
One of the objects of the present invention is thus to provide novel 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine compounds and their derivatives that are capable of being precursors of the corresponding 5-sulfanylhistidines and their disulfides.
Another object of the present invention is a method for preparing these novel 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine compounds and their derivatives using a novel method of direct introduction of an acylsulfanyl group in position 5 of a histidine or one of its derivatives without protective group and in water as solvent.
Another object of the present invention is the use of these novel 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine compounds and their derivatives as precursors of the corresponding 5-sulfanylhistidines and their disulfides.
These objects are achieved by the present invention which is based on the design and the preparation of novel 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine compounds and their derivatives, which are shown to be excellent precursors of the corresponding 5-sulfanylhistidines and their disulfides, by using a novel method for introducing an acylsulfanyl group. This has been exemplified by the applicant.

I—Preparation of the 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine Derivatives as Precursors of the 5-sulfanylhistidines and their Disulfides
In the first paragraph, examples are given of the preparation of the 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine derivatives by activation with dibromine or N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and reaction of the intermediate formed with thioacetic acid.
In the second paragraph, examples are given of the use of these 5-acylsulfanyl derivatives, generally prepared in situ, as precursor of 5-sulfanylhistidines and their derivatives.
I.1. Preparation of the 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine Derivatives by Activation with Dibromine or with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and Reaction with Thioacetic Acid
Example 1: Preparation of L-5-acetylsulfanyl-histidine (Compound 1) by Activation with Dibromine and Reaction with Thioacetic Acid
The hydrochloride of monohydrated L-histidine (52.93 g; 250 mmoles; 1 eq.) is dissolved in 1.5 L of demineralized water, then the solution is cooled to 0° C. in 30 minutes. Under strong stirring, dibromine (16.7 mL; 51.93 g; 325 mmoles; 1.3 eq.) is added dropwise very rapidly. The solution turns red. Thioacetic acid (73.3 mL; 78.46 g; 1 mole; 4 eq.) is added very rapidly: the solution immediately becomes decolorized and changes from red to light yellow.

II. Application Examples
II.1 Transformation of the 5-acylsulfanyl Derivatives Prepared In Situ into Corresponding 5-sulfanylhistidine Derivatives by Hydrolysis
To illustrate the application of the 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine derivatives according to the invention, in a nonlimiting manner, application examples are given in this paragraph of the novel 5-acylsulfanyl-histidine derivatives, generally prepared in situ, as precursor of 5-sulfanylhistidines and their derivatives.
These examples illustrate the usefulness of the novel 5-acylsulfanyl derivatives described in the invention for easily preparing 5-sulfanylhistidine compounds and their derivatives such as the disulfides, which, furthermore, are very difficult to prepare and require multistep syntheses.
In order to obtain better yields of 5-sulfanylhistidine derivatives, the 5-acylsulfanyl compounds are prepared in situ, then hydrolyzed directly thereafter, by stirring the reaction medium, preferably while heating the reaction medium. The presence of a thiol, such as mercaptopropionic acid or dithiothreitol, proves to be useful for the easy isolation of the 5-sulfanylhistidine derivatives, but it is not needed at all for the hydrolysis itself, as demonstrated in the follow-up examples 18d, 19b and 19c.
Example 22: “One Pot” Preparation of L-5-sulfanylhistidine Via In-Situ Preparation of 5-acetylsulfanylhistidine Followed by Hydrolysis (Compound 18)
The hydrochloride of monohydrated L-histidine (10.48 g; 50 mmoles; 1 eq.) is dissolved in 300 mL of demineralized water and hydrochloric acid concentrated at 37% (4.17 mL; 4.92 g; 50 mmoles; 1 eq.), then the solution is cooled to 0° C. Very strong stirring is maintained. N-Bromosuccinimide (11.56 g; 65 mmoles; 1.3 eq.) is added in a single portion: the mixture becomes limpid orange. Thioacetic acid (14.7 mL; 15.69 g; 200 mmoles; 4 eq.) is added all at once. Vigorous stirring is maintained at 0° C. for 1 h. 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (26 mL; 32.2 g; 300 mmoles; 6 eq.) is added, then the slightly yellow solution is heated at 90° C. for 18 h. The solution is extracted with three times 300 mL of ethyl acetate. After neutralization and crystallization in the presence of dithiothreitol (231 mg; 1.5 mmoles; 0.03 eq.), the desired compound 18 crystallizes. The solid is filtered and dried under a vacuum to yield 2.97 g (31%; 41% with respect to the quantity of the intermediate SAc) of L-5-sulfanylhistidine (Compound 18) in the form of an off-white solid.
