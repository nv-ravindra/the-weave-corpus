The present invention relates to new hydroxyester derivatives, to a process for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.
The compounds of the present invention are new and have very valuable pharmacological characteristics in the field of apoptosis and cancerology.
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a physiological process that is crucial for embryonic development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis.
Apoptotic-type cell death involves morphological changes such as condensation of the nucleus, DNA fragmentation and also biochemical phenomena such as the activation of caspases which cause damage to key structural components of the cell, so inducing its disassembly and death. Regulation of the process of apoptosis is complex and involves the activation or repression of several intracellular signalling pathways (Cory S. et al., Nature Review Cancer 2002, 2, 647-656).
Deregulation of apoptosis is involved in certain pathologies. Increased apoptosis is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and ischaemia. Conversely, deficits in the implementation of apoptosis play a significant role in the development of cancers and their chemoresistance, in auto-immune diseases, inflammatory diseases and viral infections. Accordingly, absence of apoptosis is one of the phenotypic signatures of cancer (Hanahan D. et al., Cell 2000, 100, 57-70).
The anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family are associated with numerous pathologies. The involvement of proteins of the Bcl-2 family is described in numerous types of cancer, such as colon cancer, breast cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, chronic lymphoid leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, pancreatic cancer, etc. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family is involved in tumorigenesis, in resistance to chemotherapy and in the clinical prognosis of patients affected by cancer. Notably, Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, is overexpressed in various types of cancer (Beroukhim R. et. al., Nature 2010, 899-905). There is, therefore, a therapeutic need for compounds that inhibit the anti-apoptotic activity of the proteins of the Bcl-2 family.
In addition to being new, the compounds of the present invention have pro-apoptotic properties making it possible to use them in pathologies involving a defect in apoptosis, such as, for example, in the treatment of cancer and of immune and auto-immune diseases.

Scaffold proteins that can be related or not to monoclonal antibodies are understood to mean a protein that contains or not an immunoglobulin fold and that yields a binding capacity similar to a monoclonal antibody. The man skilled in the art knows how to select the protein scaffold. More particularly, it is known that, to be selected, such a scaffold should display several features as follow (Skerra A., J. Mol. Recogn. 2000, 13, 167-187): phylogenetically good conservation, robust architecture with a well-known three-dimensional molecular organization (such as, for example, crystallography or NMR), small size, no or only a low degree of post-translational modifications, easy to produce, express and purify. Such a protein scaffold can be, but without limitation, a structure selected from the group consisting in fibronectin and preferentially the tenth fibronectin type III domain (FNfn10), lipocalin, anticalin (Skerra A., J. Biotechnol. 2001, 74(4), 257-75), the protein Z derivative from the domain B of staphylococcal protein A, thioredoxin A or any protein with a repeated domain such as an “ankyrin repeat” (Kohl et al., PNAS 2003, 100(4), 1700-1705), “armadillo repeat”, “leucine-rich repeat” or “tetratricopeptide repeat”. There could also be mentioned a scaffold derivative from toxins (such as, for example, scorpion, insect, plant or mollusc toxins) or protein inhibitors of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (PIN).

PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY
Example A: Inhibition of Mcl-1 by the Fluorescence Polarisation Technique
The relative binding potency of each compound was determined via Fluorescence Polarisation (FP). The method utilised a Fluorescein labelled ligand (Fluorescein-βAla-Ahx-A-REIGAQLRRMADDLNAQY-OH; mw 2,765) which binds to the Mcl-1 protein (such that Mcl-1 corresponds to the UniProtKB® primary accession number: Q07820) leading to an increased anisotropy measured in milli-polarisation (mP) units using a reader. The addition of a compound which binds competitively to the same site as the ligand will result in a greater proportion of unbound ligand in the system indicated by a decrease in mP units.
An 11 point serial dilution of each compound was prepared in DMSO and 2 μl transferred into flat bottomed, low binding, 384-well plate (final DMSO concentration 5%). 38 μl of buffer (10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4), containing the Fluorescein labelled ligand (final concentration 1 nM) and Mcl-1 protein (final concentration 5 nM) was then added.
Assay plates were incubated ˜2 hours at room temperature before FP was measured on a Biomek Synergy2 reader (Ex. 528 nm, Em. 640 nm, Cut off 510 nm) and mP units calculated. The binding of increasing doses of test compound was expressed as a percentage reduction in mP compared to a window established between ‘5% DMSO only’ and ‘100% inhibition’ controls. 11-point dose response curves were plotted with XL-Fit software using a 4-Parameter Logistic Model (Sigmoidal Dose-Response Model) and the inhibitory concentrations that gave a 50% reduction in mP (IC50) were determined. Results are presented in Table 1 below.
The results show that the compounds of the invention inhibit interaction between the Mcl-1 protein and the fluorescent peptide described hereinbefore.
Example B: In Vitro Cytotoxicity
The cytotoxicity studies were carried out on the H929 multiple myeloma tumour line.
The cells are distributed onto microplates and exposed to the test compounds for 48 hours.
The cell viability is then quantified by a colorimetric assay, the Microculture Tetrazolium Assay (Cancer Res., 1987, 47, 939-942).
The results are expressed in IC50 (the concentration of compound that inhibits cell viability by 50%) and are presented in Table 1 below.
The results show that the compounds of the invention are cytotoxic.  TABLE 1

Example C: Quantification of the Cleaved Form of PARP In Vivo
The ability of the compounds of the invention to induce apoptosis, by measuring cleaved PARP levels, is evaluated in a xenograft model of AMO-1 multiple myeloma cells. 1.107 AMO-1 cells are grafted sub-cutaneously into immunosuppressed mice (SCID strain). 12 to 14 days after the graft, the animals are treated by intraveinous or oral routes with the various compounds. After treatment, the tumour masses are recovered and lysed, and the cleaved form of PARP is quantified in the tumour lysates.
The quantification is carried out using the “Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) ELISA platform” test, which specifically assays the cleaved form of PARP. It is expressed in the form of an activation factor corresponding to the ratio between the quantity of cleaved PARP in the treated mice divided by the quantity of cleaved PARP in the control mice.
The results show that the compounds of the invention are capable of inducing apoptosis in AMO-1 tumour cells in vivo.
Example D: Anti-Tumour Activity In Vivo
The anti-tumour activity of the compounds of the invention is evaluated in a xenograft model of AMO-1 multiple myeloma cells.
1×107 AMO-1 cells are grafted sub-cutaneously into immunosuppressed mice (SCID strain).
6 to 8 days after the graft, when the tumour mass has reached about 150 mm3, the mice are treated with the various compounds in a daily schedule (5-day treatment). The tumour mass is measured twice weekly from the start of treatment.
The results obtained using ΔT/C ratio (i.e. qualification parameter of the activity of a product, which is defined as the ratio tumour volume of the treated group/tumour volume of the untreated control group) show that the compounds of the invention induce significant tumour regression during the treatment period.
