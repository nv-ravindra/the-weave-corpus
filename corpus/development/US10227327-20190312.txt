This application is a section 371 national phase application based PCT/GB2014/053009, filed Oct. 6, 2014, which claims priority to Great Britain Patent Appl. No. 1317619.3, filed Oct. 4, 2013, which are incorporated by reference in its entirety.
FIELD
The present invention relates to inhibitors of metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) comprising a zinc chelating compound, and their use to improve the effectiveness of a β-lactam antibiotic against resistant bacteria producing an MBL. The inhibitors comprise a zinc chelating agent covalently bound to a molecular moiety having affinity to structures in the bacterial biology, and may be used in combination with a β-lactam antibiotic for the therapy of bacterial infection in a host organism. The host organism may be any living organism having an undesired invasion or infection by a target organism. The host organism may thus be any living organism, although preferably it will be one comprising eukaryotic cells, more preferably a warm-blooded animal, e.g. a mammal. The target organism may be any procaryotic organism, preferably a bacterium.
BACKGROUND
Infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide and account for more than 13 million deaths annually including nearly two-thirds of all childhood mortality at less than 5 years of age. There is serious concern regarding new and re-emerging infectious diseases, in which effective therapies are lacking (World Health Organization reports 1999, 2012 and 2014). Antimicrobial resistance is escalating and affects a very broad range of human diseases including tuberculosis, cholera, malaria, and AIDS. Of particular concern is the number of human pathogens developing multidrug resistance to conventional antibiotics and it is estimated that the burden of resistance will surpass that of e.g. cervical cancer (de Kraker M E A. et al, PLoS Med. 2011; e1001104). The introduction of new, more potent derivatives of existing antibiotics provides only temporary solutions, since existing resistance mechanisms rapidly adapt to accommodate the new derivatives (Theuretzbacher U. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2011: 11:433-438). Although resistant Gram-positive bacteria pose a significant threat, the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of common Gram-negative pathogens such as Escherichia coli are of special concern. Pan-resistance or extreme drug resistance are now commonly used terms to describe clinically important isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to virtually all antibiotics (Patel et al, Front. Microbiol. 2013:4:48). Unfortunately there are few, if any, antimicrobial agents effective against Gram-negative bacteria either in or entering phase 1 clinical trials that will address this critical need (Butler M S. et al, J. Antibiotics 2013:66:571-591).
Probably the most important antibiotic resistance mechanisms in terms of distribution and clinical relevance are β-lactamases (Bush K. et al, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011: 65:455-478). β-lactamases are enzymes that hydrolyse β-lactam antibiotics compromising the efficacies of β-lactams our largest group and mainstay of antimicrobial chemotherapy for >70 years. Clearly, there is a need for inhibitors directed against these classes of enzymes that will restore the activity of their substrates—antibiotics that are cheap, non-toxic and normally effective. Serine β-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam) have been a phenomenal success in extending the therapeutic life of β-lactam antibiotics and are also employed as diagnostic tools in clinical microbiological laboratories worldwide. In contrast, there is no clinical inhibitor available for metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs; Drawz et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2014:58:1835-1846). The latter has now become one of the most clinically important families of β-lactamases showing global dissemination.
MBLs belong to a large group of proteins only found in bacteria, and like penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) have the ability to interact with β-lactams. Examples of PBPs and enzymes that bind β-lactams are MBLs, serine β-lactamase-like protein (LACTB), D,D-transferase, D-Ala(D,D)-carboxypeptidase, the D-Alanyl-D-alanine Dipeptidases VanA, VanX, VanY and others, as reviewed by Sauvage E. et al in FEMS Microbiol Rev 32 (2008): 234-258. This class of proteins is only found in bacterial biology. Examples of compounds having affinity for PBPs are β-lactam antibiotics. β-Lactams have been the historical anchor of antibacterial chemotherapy and include penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams and carbapenems (Bush K. et al, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011: 65:455-478). The mechanism of action for the β-lactam antibiotics is that they mimic the small dipeptide D-Ala-D-Ala that the bacteria use to crosslink peptidoglycans in the bacterial wall, covalently destroying enzymes that use D-Ala-D-Ala as their substrate. β-lactamases are the most prevalent and clinically important resistance mechanism inactivating β-lactams by hydrolysis. They are classified according to sequence criteria (Ambler class A, B, C and D) and can be structurally grouped into two super families; the serine β-lactamases (class A, C, and D) and MBLs (class B). In contrast to the serine β-lactamases, which are characterized by a serine moiety in the active site, MBLs require divalent cations, usually zinc, as a metal co-factor of enzyme activity (Palzkill T. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2013:91-404). MBLs are emerging as one of the most clinically important family of β-lactamases (Patel et al, Front. Microbiol. 2013:4:48; Walsh et al, Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents 2010:S8-S14) for the following reasons:
(i) Acquired MBL genes are associated with mobile genetic elements that often carry other resistance genes as gene clusters (associated with IS and ISCR elements) and/or integron arrays resulting in multi-drug resistant isolates. In many parts of the world such elements are now commonly observed in clinical important pathogens such as P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and several Enterobacteriaceae geni. Thus, the plasticity and dissemination of these highly mobile resistance gene clusters severely compromises existing therapeutic regimes.
(ii) The hydrolytic spectrum of MBLs is one of the broadest of all β-lactamases and includes nearly all β-lactams except the monobactams (aztreonam). Accordingly, clinical isolates possessing MBLs are invariably resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics except for the monobactams. However, virtually all MBL positive bacteria carry additional β-lactamases that can hydrolyze aztreonam and therefore this therapy is not recommended.
The clinically most important MBLs, the IMP-, VIM- and NDM-groups, are now widespread in a variety of Gram-negative species. In particular, VIM- and NDM-enzymes have emerged as the dominant MBLs. The unprecedented global dissemination of NDM highlights the enormity of the problem. Since the first report in 2008, NDM has been identified in Australia, Africa, North-America, Asia and many European countries (Johnson A P. et al, J. Med. Microbiol. 2013:62:499-513). Worryingly, NDM is found in numerous Gram-negative species and in the environment (Walsh T R. et al, Lancet Infect. Dis. 2011: 11:355-362).
Successful inhibitors of class A serine β-lactamases are clinically available, but lack inhibitory activity against MBLs (Drawz S M. et al, Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2010:23:160-201). Inspired by the commercial success of the paradigm Augmentin (clavulanic acid—a suicide substrate for serine β-lactamases—and amoxicillin) several research groups have focused on similar approaches to develop inhibitors, but yet no molecules that combine potency with activity against multiple MBL targets have reached clinical trials (Drawz S M. et al. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2014). For the three clinically most threatening MBLs—the IMP, NDM and VIM groups—most inhibitors are reported for IMP-1, while few inhibitors are found for VIM-2 and NDM. For NDM, a fungal natural product, aspergillomarasmine A has been identified as an MBL inhibitor and shown in vivo activity in mouse models (King A M. et al. Nature 2014:510:503-506). However, relatively high doses of aspergillomarasmine A are required to reverse carbapenem resistance. Other therapeutic options (Martinez, Future Med. Chem. 2012) include the use of tri-β-lactam therapy incorporating a monobactam; however, the MICs are not impressive and their in vivo activity is severely compromised by the bacterial inoculum (Page et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother 2011).
Thus, there is a strong clinical need for an MBL inhibitor. The majority of potent inhibitors of IMP-1 contain a thiol-carboxylate or a dicarboxylate pharmacophore, while among VIM-2 inhibitors the thiocarboxylates are the most dominant. The only inhibitors, which target IMP-1 and VIM-2 simultaneously, are found among these structural motifs. However, the recently characterized maleic acid derivatives lack broad spectrum inhibition i.e. show poor inhibition against the clinically important VIM and NDM-group enzymes. Nevertheless, some structurally very different inhibitors selectively targeting VIM-2 in favour of IMP-1 have been reported (Weide et al, Med. Chem. Lett. 2010). Few studies have evaluated the inhibitor efficiency in extensive whole cell assays and, even less so, in vivo efficacy in animal models. The majority of inhibitors heavily rely on monodentate zinc-binding groups like a thiol or a carboxylate group complexing the enzymatically bound zinc ions. Interestingly, typical bidentate zinc-binding groups successfully applied in the design of inhibitors of other zinc-containing metalloproteins like hydroxamates are—with one exception—not reported. Comparison of the available structures reveals that all inhibitors substitute the bridging hydroxide in dinuclear zinc MBLs by a heteroatom e.g. S or O.
Clinically important bacteria are well known in the prior art—see e.g. Wikipedia. Especially, P. aeruginosa causes serious problem because of its conspicuous multidrug resistance. So called scavengers, e.g. sulbactam, clavulanic acid, and tazobactam which are used as β-lactamase inhibitors in general are effective against serine-β-lactamase having serine as an active centre, but these drugs exhibit less or no inhibiting effect on MBLs. Therefore, the need for new MBL inhibitors becomes increasingly important. Important β-lactam antibiotics are the penicillin, cephlosporin and carbapenem classes. Many compounds have been reported as having MBL inhibiting activities. In WO 98/117639, WO 97/30027, WO 98/40056, WO 98/39311, and WO 97/110225, a class of β-thiopropionyl-amino acid derivatives has been described as the inhibitors against the MBLs. Other compound classes that may act as MBL inhibitors are thioesters (Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1997, 20, 1136; FEMS Microbiology Letters 1997, 157, 171; Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997, 41, 135; Chem. Commun. 1998, 1609; Biochem. 1.1998, 331, 703; WO 00/076962) and succinic acid derivatives (WO 01/030148 and WO 01/030149).
The use of metal chelators against virus or bacteria has been well described in the prior art, e.g. in WO 2011/63394, WO 2004/71425, WO 2006/109069, WO 2001/60349, U.S. Pat. No. 6,410,570, US 2003/0225155, WO 2006/43153 and WO 2006/43153. The person skilled in the art will appreciate the variety of substances described in prior art, capable of chelating metal ions, and will select an appropriate chelator for different purposes. Examples are chelators comprising variations of amino groups and hydroxyl groups, e.g. 1,10-phenanthroline, clioquinol, 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone (DMHP), 1,2-diethyl-3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone (DEHP), deferasirox, chelators comprising variations of amino groups, hydroxyl groups and carboxylic acid groups, e.g. ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA), ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic-N,N′-di-B-propionic acid (EDPA), diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), trans-1,2-cyclohexane-diamine-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (CyDTA), carnosine, dihydroxyethylglycine (DHEG),1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic (DTPA-OH), ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid (EDDA), ethylenediamine-N,N′-dipropionic acid (EDDP), N-hydroxy-ethylenediamine-N,N′,N′-triacetic acid (EDTA-OH), N,N′-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid (HBED), hexamethylene-1,6-diaminetetraacetic acid (HDTA), hydroxyethyliminodiacetic acid (HIDA), iminodiacetic acid (IDA), Methyl-EDTA, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), nitrilotripropionic acid (NTP), triethylenetetraaminehexaacetic acid (TTHA), ethylenediamine-di(O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (EDDHA), ethyleneglycol bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), trans-1,2-cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid (CDTA), N-(2-hydroxyethyl) ethylenedinitrilotriacetic acid (HEDTA), N-(2-hydroxyethyl) iminodiacetic acid (HEIDA), citric acid, 7,19,30-trioxa-1,4,10,13,16,22,27,33-octaazabicyclo[11,11,11] pentatriacontane (O-Bistren), penicillamine, chelators also comprising sulfur or phosphorus, e.g. diethyldithiocarbamate(DEDTC), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), ethylmaltol (EM), 4-(6-Methoxy-8-quinaldinyl-aminosulfonyl)benzoic acid potassium salt (TFLZn), dithiozone, N-(6-methoxy-8-quinolyl)-para-toluenesulfonamide (TSQ), ethylenediamine-N,N′-bis(methylphosphonic) acid (EDDPO), ethylenediaminetetra(methylenephosphonic) acid (EDTPO), nitrilotrimethylenphosphonic acid (NTPO), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), deferoxamine, dimercaprol, dimercaptosuccinic acid, and etidronic acid. However, these chelators are known in the prior art, e.g. in Smith, R. M.; Martell, A. E. NIST Critically Selected Stability Constants of Metal Complexes, Version 2.0; U.S. Department of Commerce: Gaithersburg, Md., 1995, as non-selective chelating agents with relatively low ability to discriminate between different metal ions. Thus, they may simultaneously have the ability to bind essential metal ions like zinc, iron, copper, nickel, cobalt, manganese and other metal ions essential in most enzymes in nature, e.g. in bacteria and mammals. This lack of selectivity may lead to undesired toxicity and other biological effects when treating specific infections by a target organism in a host organism, e.g. when it is desirable to affect only specific microorganisms whilst the toxicological effect on the host organism or other species which are not a target for the treatment is low.
A key element necessary for normal life of a bacterial cell is the homeostasis of zinc. Zinc is the second most abundant transition metal in the human body and is responsible for the catalytic function and structural stability of over 6000 enzymes and proteins (Bertini, et al, Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry 111 (2012) 150-156). Manipulation of the freely available zinc in a cell has been shown to affect a great range of diseases and conditions (Que et al, J. Chem. Rev. (Washington, D.C., U. S.) 2008, 108, 1517-1549; Peterson, et al Mol. Biol. 2009, 388, 144-158; BarKalifa et al, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2009, 618, 15-2; Maret et al, Mol. Med. 2007, 13, 371-375). The concentration of free zinc varies in biological tissues depending on zinc buffering capacity. In PC12, HeLa, and HT-29 cell lines, as well as in primary cultures of cardiac myocytes and neurons in vitro, the concentration of free zinc has been determined to be approximately 5 nM (Bozym et al, Exp. Biol. Med. 2010, 235, 741-750). Zinc is a soft metal, mainly found in the nature as salpherite or zinc sulfite, with Zn oxidation state+2 (Emsley, J. “Zinc”. Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements; Oxford University Press: New York, 2001). In order to chelate zinc selectively and with high efficacy, the use of soft basic ligands are needed. The lipophilic zinc chelator, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), has been reported to display many interesting biological activities due to its zinc chelating properties as well as its lipophilic character, allowing cell-membrane penetrating abilities (Donadelli et al, J. Cell. Biochem. 2008: 104, 202-212). In the TPEN molecule, the zinc-binding ability is based on the binding of two or more units of the picoylamine unit (see Scheme 1).
Other technologies employ sulfur based ligands, also yielding high selectivity for zinc compared to other endogenous metal ions (Zhang et al, Tetrahedron 2013, 69, 15-21). Zinc sensing in bacteria is carried out by regulators of different families, including SmtB/ArsR, MerR, TetR, MarR, and the Fur family (Napolitano et al, Journal of Bacteriology 2012, p. 2426-2436). X-ray structures of MBLs indicate a tightly bound zinc ion at the active site, and often the structures reveal two Zn atoms at the catalytic site, one tight and one more loosely bound (Palzkill T. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2013:91-404). Subclass B1 is the largest MBL family, including the majority of enzymes such as the IMPs, VIMs and NDMs. The B1 enzymes feature a conserved Zn(II) binding motif and there are two Zn2+ at the active site of B1 enzymes, with Zn1 bound by three His residues and Zn2 by one His, one Cys and one Asp. In addition, there is a bridging water or hydroxide ligand between the two Zn ions, which is believed to be the nucleophile that hydrolyses the substrate, e.g. the β-lactam antibiotic. The zinc ions are essential for the activity of the enzymes. In some embodiments the MBL inhibitors contain a Zn(II) binding group that can interact with the central metal ion(s) strongly. In the prior art, zinc chelators have been described as inhibitors of multiple diseases simultaneously, e.g. in WO 2006/117660, WO 2001/60349 or U.S. Pat. No. 6,410,570). Zinc chelators have also been suggested as antibacterial agents, e.g. in WO 2009/140215, as inhibitors of biofilm formation, e.g. in WO 2011/63394 and WO 2009/155088, or as antiviral agents, e.g. in WO 2004/71425 and WO 2006/43153. Attractive bacterial zinc-dependent targets involved in resistance mechanisms are known in the prior art to be inhibited by zinc chelating agents. Three examples are the tightly regulated bacterial zinc uptake system Zur (Ellison et al in PLOS ONE 8 (2013), e75389), biofilms (Conrady et al, PNAS (2008) 105 (49), 19456-19461) and the peptidase HmrA in MRSA. All these targets are inhibited by state of the art zinc chelators like TPEN, EDTA or the phenanthrolines. However, these agents do not possess specific affinity for bacterial biology, and are also toxic to mammals. Another example of vital zinc-dependent machineries is bacterial use of the efflux pumps (Nikaido, et al, FEMS Microbiology Reviews 36 (2012) 340-363), adapting almost all modern antibiotics as substrates, excreting them from the bacterial cell. Yet another example is the zinc-dependent deacetylase LpxC (Liang et al, J. Med. Chem. 2013, 56, 6954-6966). Another example is the highly zinc-dependent bacterial ribosomal function (Graham et el, J. Biol. Chem. 284 (2009) pp. 18377-18389). The latter uses 8 zinc atoms on the 70S ribosomal unit.
However, in these descriptions, there is no guidance on how to obtain selective effects of the zinc chelation therapy in the target species whilst a host organism is affected at a low enough level to avoid issues related to, for example, toxicity. Thus there is a medical need for zinc chelating agents with a low toxicity in a host organism, whilst also having a selective effect on the target organism.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
It has now been surprisingly found that in a synthesized library of novel compounds, lead candidate inhibitors affect resistant bacterial strains harboring MBLs. The lead compounds show EC50 values in the nanomolar range against some of the most clinically relevant bacterial strains, harboring some of the most important MBLs. The lead candidates contain three central structural elements (see also FIG. 1) in a construct not previously described in the prior art:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
A-L-B
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
wherein A is zinc chelator, L is a linker, and B is a vector.  Moiety A is any lipophilic, selective Zn(II) chelating group. The term “chelating” relates to the greek term “chelos” denoting a crab claw binding an object via at least two contact points. Thus, a chelating agent in chemistry may be defined as a molecular moiety:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
(C)mRc(RL)  (II)
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
where m is an integer from 2 to 10;  each group C is a functional group that may be the same or different having Lewis base properties and possessing at least one heteroatom selected from N, S, O or P capable of donating electrons to a Lewis acid, M, which in the present invention is a zinc atom; Rc is a unit linking the groups C which may contain up to 50 atoms, and which carries a functional group RL; and  RL comprises a covalent link to the linker L in the construct A-L-B herein defined.
Moiety L is a linker or bond that covalently links A and B. The linker L may optionally have ligand groups supporting Zn(II) chelating groups.
Moiety B may be a group interacting with biological structures found in bacteria, e.g. this may be specific to MBLs, DD-transferases, or other enzymes not found in human biology and thereby having less toxicity to humans, or it may facilitate transport over bacterial membranes.
More specifically, B may be a chemical moiety having affinity for biological structures found in prokaryotic cells like bacteria, or in virus or parasites. At the same time, moiety B has a sufficiently low affinity for biological structures found in organisms comprising eukaryotic cells, e.g. in mammals, especially higher mammals like humans so as not to induce undesired effects like signs of toxicity.
Thus, in one embodiment the moiety B may be a molecular moiety found in bacteria but not in the host organism. Non-limiting examples of such moieties are peptidoglycans only found in bacteria. These comprise linear chains of two alternating amino sugars, N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). Each MurNAc is attached to a short (4- to 5-residue) amino acid chain. These amino acid chains consist of building blocks not found in mammalian biology, often with the R configuration of the amino acid functionality, corresponding to the D configuration in molecules comprising an α-amino acid functionality. The following non-limiting list of building blocks may be present in moiety B as used in the present invention: L-lysine, L-alanine, D- or L-glutamic acid, D-glutamine, meso-diaminopimelic acid, D-2,3-diamino propanoic acid, D-alanine or other amino acids with the D-configuration, and any derivatives thereof (e.g. ester derivatives). D-amino acids do not occur in proteins and are not found in eucaryotic organisms. Thus, in one embodiment, moiety B may be a construct comprising any combination of the building blocks listed above or molecules mimicking such a construct. One example of a compound mimicking a tripeptide comprising amino acids with the D-configuration is aspergillomarasmine, which is described in the prior art, e.g. by Mikami et al, Agricultural and Biological Chemistry (1983), 47(11): 2693-5. Preferred are combinations of amino acids with the D-configurations, e.g. combinations of D-glutamic acid, D-glutamine, meso-diaminopimelic acid and D-alanine. Other combinations of amino acids which may be used are combinations of D-alanine, for example the building block D-Alanine-D-Alanine itself or a derivative thereof such as glycyl-L-α-amino-ε-pimelyl-D-Alanine-D-Alanine. In any of these constructs, the carboxylic acid moiety in the amino acid building blocks may be substituted by isoelectronic functional groups like boronic acid, —B(OH)2, phosphoric acid, —P(═O)(OH)2, or sulfonic acid, —SO3H. The carboxylic acid or any of these isoelectronic functional groups may also be esterified. Moiety B may also be a substrate for any of the enzymes which use constructs of these building blocks as a substrate in the process of building the bacterial wall or membrane, e.g. D,D-transferase which uses D-Ala-D-Ala.
In another embodiment, moiety B may comprise a β-lactam structural unit having an affinity for a large group of proteins only found in bacteria, denoted penicillin-binding proteins (PBP). Examples of PBPs are MBLs, serine beta-lactamase-like protein (LACTB), D,D-transferase, D-Ala(D,D)-carboxypeptidase, the D-Alanyl-D-alanine Dipeptidases VanA, VanX, VanY and others, as reviewed by Sauvage et al in FEMS Microbiol Rev 32 (2008) 234-258. Other members of this protein class may facilitate transport over bacterial membranes. This class of proteins is only found in bacterial biology, not in mammalian biology, and is a suitable class of targets for the molecular moiety B in the constructs according to the present invention. Examples of compounds having an affinity for PBPs are β-lactam antibiotics. Thus, derivatives of penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems and monobactams are examples of molecular moieties which may be used as moiety B in the invention. These classes represent large classes of antibiotic agents on the market, and many building blocks in their synthetic process are commercially available for use in the construct A-L-B in the present invention.
As stated above, an example of a DD-transferase substrate, useful as a moiety B unit is D-Ala-D-Ala, which is used as a building block for bacterial wall synthesis. Antibacterial agents are molecules that have a selective interaction with biological structures found in bacteria, and not in human biology; for example, penicillins mimic D-Ala-D-Ala and thus act as an antagonist for DD-transferase. Further, β-lactam antibiotics are substrates for MBLs. Thus, moiety B may be any substrate for bacterial biological structures. Non-limiting examples of moiety B include: penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam, monobactams (e.g. aztreonam), thiopropionyl-amino acid derivatives, thioesters, succinic acid derivatives and maleic acid derivatives.
The zinc-binding unit A comprises at least one lipophilic metal chelating function with selectivity for zinc. A preferred, but non-limiting example of the molecular moiety A is the moiety comprising two 2-pyridyl-methyl units, denoted dipicoyl (see Scheme 2, A, B) with an adjacent donor atom D assisting the stabilization of the zinc-chelating dipicoyl unit (Scheme 2, A-C). The moiety A may also comprise more than two 2-pyridyl-methyl units, e.g. a novel TPEN derivative. TPEN, as defined above, has been widely used in many biological applications in the prior art. TPEN has four 2-pyridyl-methyl units, rendering the zinc chelating ability stronger. A TPEN derivative as depicted in Scheme 2D, with a covalent bond to a linker group L, is not known in the prior art and is a part of the present invention. Scheme 2E shows a further example of a suitable chelating moiety A.
D=an electron donating atom, L=a linker as defined herein; S1═H or an alkyl group, S2═H, lower alkoxy or a hydroxy group; E=CH or N.
To have a strong interaction with essential zinc atoms necessary for the MBLs to function properly, the preferred zinc-chelating function needs to have as low as possible a dissociation constant Kd with zinc. The dissociation constant Kd is the inverse of the metal complex formation constant Kf so Kd=1/Kf. In the present invention, the Kd value in general is preferably lower than 1×10−5 M, even more preferably lower than 1×10−8 M, yet more preferably lower than 20×10−10 M or lower than 1×10−10 M. In general, the dipicoyl units in Scheme 2 A and B have Kd with zinc in the range 1-10×10−10 M (Åstrand, et al, Tetrahedron 69 (2013) 8645-8654). The lipophilic, cell-penetrating zinc chelator TPEN has a dissociation constant (Kd) with zinc of 0.26×10−15 M (Makhov, et al, Cell Death Differ. 2008, 15, 1745).
The o-hydroxybenzylidene-hydrazide moiety (Scheme 2E) may also be used in the present invention, and is also reported in the prior art to have zinc-chelating properties with Kd values in the range 1-30×10−10 M (Putt, et al, Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006, 2, 543; Charkoudian, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 12424; Hsu, et al, ACS Comb. Sci. 2012, 14, 44).
In Ganta, et al, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 19 (2009) 1618-1622, a group of compounds have been reported, having a hydroxamate group as a zinc-chelating moiety in the same molecular moiety as a group with affinity for MBLs. However, according to Smith, R. M.; Martell, A. E. NIST Critically Selected Stability Constants of Metal Complexes, Version 2.0; U.S. Department of Commerce: Gaithersburg, Md., 1995, the hydroxamate complexing dissociation constant with zinc is reported to be in the range 10−4, which is five orders of magnitude higher than shown for the dipicoylamines. Further, the hydroxamate group is a non-selective chelating group, also demonstrating binding of Fe2+/Fe2+ and many other metal ions, making hydroxamate ligands less specific, and more prone to interaction with human biology leading to higher human toxicity. Ligands based on the 2-pyridyl-methyl units demonstrate remarkably high selectivity for zinc and cadmium (Xu, et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 601), the latter is not a natural metal ion in biological systems. Zinc chelating agents are also suggested in the prior art to act as MBL inhibitors, in WO 2012/088283, thiazolidines and analogous compounds are suggested as MBL inhibitors together with beta lactams. The use of the di-picoylamine group in zinc chelators is not mentioned herein. However, these agents also have complexing dissociation constants with zinc which are significantly higher than the nanomolar range. Also, no IC50 values below the micromolar range in MBL assays are found in WO 2012/088383.
Each of the Schemes 3-5 below is provided for the purpose of illustration and description of a part of the invention only, and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present invention. Thus, members of the library of compounds synthesized so far, are exemplified, but not limited to those in Schemes 3-5.
All of the exemplified molecules have a dissociation constant Kd with zinc of less than 1×10−10 M.
A general preparation process for some library members is exemplified in Scheme 6: One preferred compound of the invention, OAA4033 (Example 24), was prepared as indicated in Scheme 7:
The compound OAA4033 (Example 24) is an example of the core of the present invention, schematically and generally denoted as A-L-B. The zinc chelator is a dipicoylamine moiety (A), the linker is a carbonylamino-phenyl group and the vector is a D-Ala-D-Ala peptide. Alternatively viewed, the zinc chelator may be considered as the dipicolylaminomethyl-carbonylamino moiety (A), the linker as the phenyl-ethyl group and the vector (B) as the D-Ala-D-Ala peptide.
As stated above, the mechanism of all β-lactam antibiotics is to mimic the D-Ala-D-Ala building block used by the bacterial enzyme DD-transferase in the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Normally, amino acids with the stereochemistry L are found in human biology. Thus, the dipeptide bacterial substrate D-Ala-D-Ala, has affinity for the bacterial enzyme DD-transferase.
Two especially preferred examples of the invention, AB773 and AB777, are prepared from the commercial compounds clavulanic acid and amoxicilline, defined as the vector B in the present invention (see Scheme 8):
The new chemical entities, hereto untested as inhibitors of MBLs, now show promising EC50 values, e.g. for VIM-2 compared to control inhibitors. The same inhibitors showed activity in both enzyme and bacterial whole cell assays with E. coli harboring VIM-2. The most active inhibitors showed even better (sub-μM) activity against other MBLs such as NDM-1 and GIM-1 and in bacterial whole cell assays with E. coli harboring GIM-1. The inhibitors showed promising performance in a bacterial synergy assay with the β-lactam antibiotic meropenem against different clinical P. aeruginosa, E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates harboring different MBLs (VIM-2, VIM-1, and NDM-1) providing evidence that these have the potential to be used as a β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination therapy. Several library candidates showed synergistic activity with meropenem. We proceeded by combining the zinc-binding fragment (fragment A) with a molecular moiety with affinity to structural units found in bacterial biology but not found in human biology (fragment B). The resulting compound (OAA4033, Example 24) shows promising performance in all in vitro tests so far and performed well in the synergy assay with meropenem. These results point in the direction of a conceptually new class of antibacterial agents.
Other compounds according to the invention include the structures in Scheme 9: wherein L is a linker as herein defined and V is a vector corresponding to moiety B as herein defined.
The macrolides are a group of antibiotics whose activity stems from the presence of a macrolide ring. They inhibit bacterial protein biosynthesis through binding to the bacterial ribosome and inhibit ribosomal transfer of tRNA as well as inhibiting ribosomal translocation. As noted above, the bacterial ribosome is an example of a highly zinc-dependent bacterial protein. Macrolide chemistry is well described in the prior art, e.g. by Liu et al in Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 19 (2009) 4079-4083. Macrolides and their derivatives are thus a further example of the vector B which may be present in the constructs herein described. For example, the carbonyl-imidazole (CDI)-activated clarithromycin derivative depicted in Scheme 10 may be used as a starting material to prepare a number of compounds for use in the present invention.
Another class of molecules useful as the vector B in the present invention includes chloramphenicol and its derivatives. Chloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic by inhibiting protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial ribosome.
As will be understood, any of the compounds herein described may be provided in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The compounds according to the invention may be converted into a salt thereof, particularly into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with an inorganic or organic acid or base.

Procedures for Salt Formation are Conventional in the Art.
Also provided herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to the invention together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.
Compositions comprising the MBL inhibitors are preferably formulated prior to administration. The active ingredients in such compositions may comprise from 0.05% to 99% by weight of the formulation. Appropriate dosages may depend on the modulator to be used, precise condition to be treated, age and weight of the patient etc. and may be routinely determined by the skilled practitioner according to principles well known in the art. By way of example, representative dosages may include 1 to 200 or 1-100 mg/kg, e.g. 5 to 70, 5-50, or 10 to 70 or 10 to 50 mg/kg.
By “pharmaceutically acceptable” is meant that the ingredients must be compatible with other ingredients of the composition as well as physiologically acceptable to the recipient. Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be formulated according to techniques and procedures well known in the art and widely described in the literature and may comprise any of the known carriers, diluents or excipients. Other ingredients may of course also be included, according to techniques well known in the art e.g. stabilisers, preservatives, etc. The formulations may be in the form of sterile aqueous solutions and/or suspensions of the pharmaceutically active ingredients, aerosols, ointments and the like. The formulations may also be in a sustained release form e.g. microparticles, nanoparticles, emulsions, nanosuspensions, lipid particles or oils. Further, an important aspect of formulation of antibacterial agents is in the form of films, patches or folios having the MBL inhibitor coated on the surface; these may also be used in the present invention.
The administration may be by any suitable method known in the medicinal arts, including oral, parenteral, topical, subcutaneous administration or by inhalation. The MBL inhibitor or formulations comprising the MBL inhibitor may be administered in a single dose to be taken at regular intervals e.g. once or twice a day, once every 48 hours or once every 72 hours. Sustained formulations may be given at longer intervals e.g. 1 to 2 times a month or every three months. The precise dosage of the active compounds to be administered, the number of daily or monthly doses and the length of the course of treatment will depend on a number of factors, including the age of the patient and their weight. The compositions may be formulated according to techniques and procedures well known in the literature and may comprise any of the known carriers, diluents or excipients. For example the compositions/formulations which can be used in the present invention which are suitable for parenteral administration conveniently may comprise sterile aqueous solutions and/or suspensions of pharmaceutically active ingredients preferably made isotonic with the blood of the recipient generally using sodium chloride, glycerin, glucose, mannitol, sorbitol and the like. In addition, the composition may contain any of a number of adjuvants, such as buffers, preservatives, dispersing agents, agents that promote rapid onset of action or prolonged duration of action. Compositions/formulations suitable for oral administration may be in sterile purified stock powder form, preferably covered by an envelope or envelopes which may contain any of a number or adjuvants such as buffers, preservative agents, agents that promote prolonged or rapid release. Compositions/formulations for use in the present invention suitable for local or topical administration may comprise the MBL inhibitor mixed with known suitable ingredients such as paraffin, vaseline, cetanol, glycerol and its like, to form suitable ointments or creams.
The invention will be described in more detail in the following non-limiting examples.
General Procedures
All reagents and solvents used are of commercial grade and were used without further purifications prior to use. NMR (1H, 13C) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVII-400 MHz, a DPX-300 MHz or a DPX-200 MHz spectrometer. Coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz, and chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to CDCl3 (7.26 ppm for 1H and 77.16 ppm for 13C) and [D6] DMSO (2.50 ppm for 1H and 39.52 ppm for 13C). IR spectra were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum BX series FT-IR spectrometer and only selected peaks are reported. All yields are uncorrected.
Example 1—Synthesis of N,N′-dipicolyl-N-propagyl amine
N,N′-dipicolylamine (5.0 mL, 22.9 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was diluted in THF (55.7 mL, 700 mmol, 25 eq.) followed by addition of K2CO3 (15.40 g, 111.4 mmol, 4.0 eq.) and propagyl bromide (4.34 mL 80%, 39.0 mmol, 1.4 eq.). The mixture was heated to reflux under heavy stirring and left for three hours. The deep red slurry was then cooled down to room temperature, filtered using a glass filter, the filter washed with 2×20 mL dichloromethane and the combined organic phases were concentrated under reduced pressure to a rust-red oil. The crude product was purified using column chromatography and the product was eluted from an alumina column by methanol in dichloromethane (1-5%) yielding 5.55 g (86%). 1H and 13C NMR are in accordance with published results.
Example 2—General Procedure for the Synthesis of Triazoles
Copper sulfate heptahydrate (250 mg, 1.0 mmol, 1.0 eq.) in 2.5 mL H2O and sodium (+)ascorbate (396 mg, 2.0 mmol, 2.0 eq.) in 2.5 mL H2O were added simultaneously to a stirring solution of the alkyne (1.0 mmol, 1.0 eq.) in 2.5 mL tBuOH. The azide solution (4.0 mL 25% in tBuOMe, 1.0 mmol, 1.0 eq) was then added and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. EDTA (293 mg, 1.0 mmol, 1.0 eq) was then added to the stirring solution and left for 60 minutes before the mixture was diluted with 50 mL H2O and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to >10 with 1M NaOH. The slurry was then extracted with 50 mL EtOAc and 50 mL dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over K2CO3 and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a dark red oil/semisolid. The crude products were purified using column chromatography by eluting a neutral Al2O3 column with 1-10% methanol in dichloromethane.

General Protocol for Microbroth Dilution Method for Evaluating Antibacterial Activity of Compounds or Synergistic Effect of Compound-Antibiotic Combination
Preparation of Bacteria
Day 1:
Plate bacterial strain(s) on appropriate media:
Gram-negative bacteria with ESBLs or carbapenemases: green agar plates with 100 mg/L ampicillin
Gram-negative bacteria without β-lactamases: green agar plates
Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococci and Enterococci): blood agar plates
Incubate o.n. at 37° C.  Day 2:  Prepare the Bacterial Inoculum:
Prepare a 0.5 McFarland suspension of bacteria in 0.85% NaCl. (Should be used within 15 min of preparation).
Dilute the 0.5 McFarland suspension 1:100 into MH broth. Check the inoculum by diluting the prepared bacterial suspension 1:100 (10 μl bacterial suspension+990 μl 0.85% NaCl). Plate 10 μl of the dilution on MH agar plates (×2). Incubate o.n. at 37° C., count the colonies and calculate the final CFU/ml inoculum in the plate by multiplying the average number of colonies with 10000 and divide by 2. The final inoculum should be between 3-7×105 CFU/ml.
Add 50 μl of the prepared bacterial suspension to each well in the microtiter plate except negative growth control.  Preparation of Compounds/Antibiotics
Calculate the desired concentration-range and volume of the compounds/antibiotics in the assay. For antibiotics this will depend on the MIC to meropenem of the bacterial strains to be tested. Dilute the stock solution in MH broth. Make subsequent 2-fold dilutions in MH broth of the desired concentrations if a concentration range is to be tested (remember the extra dilution factor in the assay plate). Always include extra volume for pipetting. Take into consideration stock solutions that are made in buffers that have an effect on bacterial growth (e.g. DMSO).  Assay:
Determining the MIC of compounds/antibiotics alone:
Add 25 μl of each concentration of compound/antibiotic to row 2-11 (highest concentration in row 2)
Add 25 μl MH broth to row 2-11
Add 50 μl MH broth to row 12 (positive control)
Add 100 μl MH broth to row 1
Add 50 μl bacterial suspension to row 2-12.
Determining the MIC of antibiotics+compounds:
Add 25 μl of each concentration of antibiotic to row 2-11 (highest concentration in row 2)
Add 25 μl of compound to row 2-11
Add 50 μl MH broth to row 12 (positive control)
Add 100 μl MH broth to row 1
Add 50 μl bacterial suspension to row 2-12.
Incubate the plate for 20 hrs at 37° C. and determine the MIC in the presence and absence of inhibitor.  Results:
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of meropenem against clinical Gram-negative isolates both positive and negative for MBLs in the presence and absence of compounds are shown in Table 4.  TABLE 4

AND: not determined
In summary, the lead hit OAA4033 (Example 24) and several of our candidates show strong synergistic potentiation of meropenem restoring the antimicrobial activity against different clinical strains of MBL-producing P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. coli. The synergistic effect was irrespective of species. No synergistic effect was observed with OAA4033 (Example 24) and OAA4085 (Example 12) in MBL-negative clinical strains indicating that the effect is specific for MBL-producing isolates. Testing of intrinsic antimicrobial activity of the compounds showed that all had an MIC of ≥1000 μM ruling out intrinsic antimicrobial activity of the compounds. Synergistic activity with meropenem and TPEN was also observed as expected. It should be noted that TPEN for some isolates showed intrinsic antimicrobial activity (MICs 250 μM-1000 μM) just above the tested concentration (125 μM) in the assay. No synergistic activity was observed with captopril.
