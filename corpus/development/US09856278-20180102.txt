TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to lysophosphatidylserine derivatives or salts thereof.

The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions or lysophosphatidylserine receptor function modulators comprising said compounds or salts thereof.
BACKGROUND ART
Lysophospholipids is the collective term for phospholipids having a single acyl group. Compared to diacylphospholipids that constitute cell membranes, lysophospholipids are less hydrophobic and have such a property that they can easily become free from the cell membranes. Acting as signal molecules between cells or membranes, some lysophospholipids have been shown to have an important role in vivo and it has heretofore been known that phospholipids in biomembranes are hydrolyzed to produce lysophospholipids when inflammatory reactions such as tissue damage take place (Patent Document 1). Lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) which is a kind of lysophospholipids is known to be involved in acute inflammations due to degranulation of mast cells (Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2). As LysoPS receptors, the G protein coupled receptors GPR34, P2Y10, A630033H20Rik and GPR174 have been identified (Non-Patent Document 3) and among these, GPR34, P2Y10, and GPR174 are referred to as LPS1, LPS2, and LPS3 (Non-Patent Document 4). Among these, LPS1 has been reported to be involved in signaling for inducing or enhancing the degranulation reaction of mast cells so that it can be a target for the treatment of allergic diseases and chronic inflammatory diseases (Patent Documents 1 and 2). It is also known that a certain lysophosphatidylserine derivative (lysophosphatidylthreonine) is a potent promoter of the degranulation reaction of mast cells (Patent Documents 3 and 4).
Methods for screening compounds useful as therapeutics for autoimmunity and the discovery of lysophosphatidylserine and derivatives thereof by such screening methods have been reported (Patent Document 5). Autoimmune diseases is the collective term for diseases that become symptomatic when an immune system which is normally a defense mechanism against foreign bodies responds excessively and even attacks normal cells or tissues of the self; autoimmune diseases are roughly divided into systemic autoimmune diseases that affect the whole body and organ-specific diseases that affect only certain organs. In general, autoimmune diseases often end up with chronic or refractory diseases and some of them are cited by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in the List of Diseases under Intensive Study. Much research has been made on the methods for treating autoimmune diseases and the methods reported so far include a method for treating chronic inflammation due to autoimmune disease using a cytokine specific antibody involved in inflammation (Patent Document 6) and a therapeutic method for disease that involves neutralizing a pathogenic autoantibody (Patent Document 7). However, much is left unraveled about the cause of autoimmune disease and no effective therapy has yet been established for many autoimmune diseases. To treat autoimmune disease, medications that suppress the immune system or anti-inflammatory drugs that mitigate inflammation (steroids or non-steroids) are being used as drugs of first choice.

Lysophosphatidylserine Receptor Function Modulators
According to one aspect of the present invention, there are provided function modulators comprising the above compounds or salts thereof, or agents for modulating the function of one or more receptors selected from among GPR34, P2Y10, and GPR174. Such lysophosphatidylserine function modulators may selectively modulate the functions of any two receptors selected from among GPR34, P2Y10, and GPR174 or may selectively modulate the function of P2Y10.
The term “lysophosphatidylserine receptor function modulators” as used herein refers to agents that act on lysophosphatidylserine receptors such as GPR34, P2Y10 and GPR174 and which, therefore, are used in order to enhance or suppress the expression of the receptor of interest or to enhance or suppress the in vivo function that is characteristic of that particular receptor.
Here, the lysophosphatidylserine receptors are module-type compounds each consisting of hydrophilic sites (amino acid site and phosphate diester site), a hydrophobic site (acyl side chain site), and a linkage site for linking the hydrophilic sites to the hydrophobic site, so by systematically converting the respective modular structures in accordance with the general synthesis processes for the above compounds and checking to see if each modular structure is necessary for the expression of biological activity, it becomes possible to unravel the required structures for lysophosphatidylserine to express its biological activity or the structural requirements for creating receptor-selective agonists. Thus, for example, the lysophosphatidylserine receptor function modulators according to the present invention can also be used as a chemical tool for unraveling unknown physiological functions of the lysophosphatidylserine receptors by allowing them to contain compounds having agonistic activity against one or more receptors, or compounds having agonistic activity selective for two receptors (dual agonistic activity) or agonistic activity selective for a single receptor. In addition, the lysophosphatidylserine receptor function modulators according to the present invention can also be used as active ingredients of the above-described pharmaceutical compositions.
<GPR34 Function Modulator>
Since GPR34 features high expression in mononuclear cells, mostly in macrophages, they are assumed to be involved in the control of migration, proliferation, and activation of macrophages and granulocytes. What is more, it was found in a pulmonary infection experiment with a pathogenic bacterium (Cryptococcus neoformans) that GPR34 knockout mice had higher pathogenic bacterium counts than native mice and were impaired in their ability to eliminate the pathogenic bacterium. Thus, it has been suggested that GPR34 is involved in a wide range of immune responses as mediated by mononuclear cells and the lysophosphatidylserine receptor function modulator that selectively modulates the function of GPR34 can be used to unravel the physiological functions associated with mononuclear cells.
There is also a report confirming that the production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was overenhanced in GPR34 knockout mice, suggesting that GPR34 has a function for suppressing the production of cytokines. In other words, the lysophosphatidylserine receptor function modulator that selectively modulates the function of GPR34 can be used as a chemical tool for unraveling the suppressed production of in vivo cytokines.
The GPR34 function modulator is also useful as pharmaceuticals such as prophylactis and therapeutics for the diseases associated with the function of GPR34.
<P2Y10 Function Modulator>
It has been shown that P2Y10 is mostly expressed in lymphatic organs such as thymus and spleen and that notably, the expression is greatly increased in activated lymphocytes. It has also been reported that P2Y10 inhibits the formation of cell aggregates from activated T lymphocytes by controlling the LFA1 function, suggesting a possible physiological function of P2Y10 that is involved in suppressing cell adhesion by inhibiting the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction of activated lymphocytes. In other words, the lysophosphatidylserine receptor function modulator that selectively modulates the function of P2Y10 can be used as a chemical tool for unraveling the physiological functions associated with suppressed cell adhesion of activated lymphocytes.
The P2Y10 function modulator is also useful as pharmaceuticals such as prophylactis and therapeutics for the diseases associated with the function of P2Y10.
<GPR174 Function Modulator>
GPR174, similar to P2Y10, is mostly expressed in lymphatic organs such as thymus and spleen and notably, the expression is greatly increased in activated lymphocytes; hence, there is a possibility that GPR174 is also responsible for some important function to be exhibited at an activation stage of the immune system. For example, it has been shown that while the P2Y10 selective agonist did not suppress the IL-2 production by activated lymphocytes, the GPR174 selective agonist inhibited the IL-2 production. It has also been reported that the single nucleotide polymorphisms of GPR174 are associated with Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism which are characterized by autoimmune antibody targeting antigens that are specifically expressed in thyroid tissue. In other words, the lysophosphatidylserine receptor function modulator that selectively modulates the function of GPR174 can be used as a chemical tool for unraveling the physiological functions associated with the suppressed IL-2 production by activated lymphocytes.
The GPR174 function modulator is also useful as prophylactis and therapeutics for the diseases associated with the function of GPR174, for example, diseases associated with the immune system, notably Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism.
Methods for Evaluating the Compounds or Salts Thereof
The agonistic activity of test compounds against the lysophosphatidylserine receptors can be evaluated using GPR34, P2Y10 or GPR174. In other words, the methods for evaluating or screening the above-described compounds or salts thereof as test compounds are not particularly limited as long as they use GPR34, P2Y10 or GPR174 but they can, for example, be performed using cells that express the gene encoding GPR34, P2Y10 or GPR174, transgenic non-human mammals that overexpress the gene encoding GPR34, P2Y10 or GPR174, or transgenic non-human mammals that express the gene encoding human GPR34, human P2Y10 or human GPR174. Here, the cells that can be used for evaluation or screening purposes are not particularly limited and include known cultured cells in common use, for example, HEK293 cell. In addition, examples of non-human mammals include mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, monkey, etc. Further in addition, screening may be performed using animal tissues or cells. In this case, the test compounds may be administered by allowing them to act on the subject as by incorporating them as in a solution or culture medium in which the tissues or cells are retained.
The compounds or salts thereof can be evaluated or screened using cultured cells that express the gene encoding GPR34, P2Y10 or GPR174, and the use of cultured cells is preferred from the screening efficiency viewpoint. In addition, since GPR34, P2Y10 or GPR174 is a G protein conjugated receptor, assay can be performed using calcium response, cAMP production, reporter gene, etc. as an indicator. It is also possible to perform an assay by further expressing in said cultured cells the gene which encodes a labeled human epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand and then determining the amount of the labeled compound to be cleaved. Specific examples of the labeled EGFR ligand include a fusion protein of EGFR ligand and alkali phosphatase (AP). In addition, EGFR ligands to be labeled include a transforming growth factor α (TGFα). To implement an assay process using the labeled EGFR ligand, reference may be made, for example, to Tokumaru et al., J Cell Biol 151, 209-220 (2000); Inoue et al., Nature Methods 9, 1021-1019 (2012).
The GPR34, P2Y10 or GPR174 to be used in the above evaluation or screening procedure is not particularly limited as long as it is a polypeptide having the activity of these receptors and, as an example, GPR34, P2Y10 or GPR174 derived from mammals such as human, mouse and rat may be used. As specific examples, polypeptides having GPR34, P2Y10 or GPR174 activity as disclosed in Patent Documents 2 and 5 may be employed.

Evaluation of Agonistic Activity Against GPR34, P2Y10 and GPR174
[Test Example 1] Agonistic Activity Evaluation by TGFα Cleavage Assay
In a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% bovine fetal calf serum (FCS), HEK293 cells were suspended to give a density of 2.0×105 cells/mL and seeded in 4 mL portions in 60 mm dishes. After 24-hr culture in the presence of 5% CO2, transfection with various expression vectors was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). For each 60 mm dish, a plasmid vector for AP labeled TGFα was used in an amount of 1 μg and a pCAGGS plasmid vector for mouse GPR34, P2Y10 or GPR174 was also used in an amount of 1 μg. The plasmid vectors were provided by the methods disclosed in Patent Documents 2 and 5. It should be noted that the AP labeled TGFα is a protein having a human placental alkaline phosphatase fused to the N terminal of membrane-bound pro-TGFα, and a plasmid vector for the AP labeled TGFα can be prepared based on the disclosure of Tokumaru et al., J Cell Biol 151, 209-220 (2000). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were dissociated using trypsin/EDTA, resuspended in the culture broth to give a density of 2.0×104 cells/well, and seeded in a 96-well plate. In the case of stimulation with compounds, a Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, containing 5 mM HEPES) was used. After standing for 30 minutes, test compounds were added at varying concentrations, followed by standing for an additional one hour in the presence of 5% CO2. The 96-well plate was centrifuged (190×g, 3 min) and 80 μL of the supernatant was transferred to another 96-well plate. A reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5)) containing 10 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) was added in an amount of 80 μL to both the supernatant and the cells. After OD405 measurement with a microplate reader (background), heating was done at 37° C. for an hour and then another OD405 measurement was performed. For each well, the background was subtracted from the absorbance measured the second time and the result was fitted to the following formula to calculate AP activity.
Further, the values obtained by subtracting the AP activity (%) for the unstimulated group were plotted on the vertical axis to draw a graph. The EC50 values calculated for the respective test compounds of Examples 2-4, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 12 were compared with the EC50 value of Reference Compound 1 represented below to calculate the agonistic activity of each compound; the results are shown in Table 3 below. For activity calculation, the compound concentration and AP activity (%) were plotted and the following criteria were adopted: +++ (the activity of Reference Compound 1 (LPS18:1)); ++++ (10 times more active than Reference Compound 1); +++++ (100 times more active); ++ (10 times less active); + (100 times less active); − (even less active). The EC50 values of the respective compounds are also cited in parentheses.  TABLE 3
