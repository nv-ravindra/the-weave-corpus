BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
α,ω-Dicarboxylic acid-terminated dialkane ethers have activity in lowering several plasma lipids, including Lp(a), triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, both in animals and in humans. See U.S. Pub. No. 2010/0256209. The compounds also are known to increase insulin sensitivity. See U.S. Pub. No. 2010/0256209. In particular, 6,6′-oxy-bis(2,2-dimethyl-4-hexanoic acid) (also known as 6-(5-carboxy-5-methyl-hexyloxy)-2,2-dimethylhexanoic acid), whose USAN name is gemcabene, and its calcium salt (gemcabene calcium) have been intensively studied in multiple clinical trials as a lipid lowering agent for the treatment of patients with low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and high low density lipoprotein (LDL). See Bays, H. E., et al., Amer. J. Cardiology, 2003, 92, 538-543. Gemcabene has been clinically tested as an anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic agent in addition to the lipid lowering activity.
A synthetic method for the preparation of 6,6′-oxybis(2,2-dimethyl-4-hexanoic acid) and other α,ω-dicarboxylic acid-terminated dialkane ethers is described by Bisgaier, C. L. et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,387, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In addition, preparation and characterization of alcohol and water solvates of 6,6′-oxybis(2,2-dimethyl-4-hexanoic acid) calcium (gemcabene calcium), for the treatment of dyslipidemia, vascular disease, and diabetes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,861,555, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Zhang, Y et al. also report a small scale synthesis of C-14- and tritiated-gemcabene congeners in J Label Compd Radiopharm 2007, 50, 602-604.
The previously disclosed syntheses raise a number of safety and environmental concerns when replicated on a scale larger than 1 kg. Thus, a need remains for safe and environmentally friendly processes for preparing α,ω-dicarboxylic acid-terminated dialkane ethers on a large scale.

General Synthesis of α,ω-Dicarboxylic Acid-Terminated Dialkane Ethers
Four different methodologies are presented for preparing α,ω-dicarboxylic acid-terminated dialkane ethers: (1) the Reformatsky reaction; (2) acid catalyzed ether synthesis; (3) alkylation; and (4) Williamson ether synthesis.
(1) The Reformatsky Reaction:
Compounds of formula (III) and corresponding salts may be prepared under certain conditions using a Reformatsky reaction according to Scheme 4. Ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate XV and halo-butyl ethers II under various conditions including solvents such as THF, methyl t-butyl ether or and ethyl ether, and zinc such as zinc powder with catalytic amount of iodine or chlorotrimethylsilane, or highly active Rieke® zinc, and at temperatures between 0° C. to 70° C. or in refluxing solvent. Such procedures are described in Cui, H.; et al.; Org. & Biomed. Chem. 2013, 10(14), 2862-2869 and Gaudemar-Bardone, F.; et al.; Synthesis, 1987, 12, 1130-1133.
(2) Acid-Catalyzed Ether Synthesis
Compounds of formula (III) and corresponding acids and salts may be prepared using an acid-catalyzed ether synthesis reaction according to Scheme 5. For instance, esters of type 53 can be synthesized by dimerization of alcohols of type 52, using the by the reaction pathway described in Scheme 7, where alcohols 52 are prepared by methods known in the art (e.g., for n=3 in two steps by alkylation of benzyl protected 4-bromobutanol (commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich) with an alkyl isobutyrate (commercially available from various suppliers, such as Sigma-Aldrich), and subsequent hydrogenation.
(3) Alkylation Method:
Compounds of formula (III) and corresponding salts may be prepared using an alkylation method according to Scheme 6. The results of the alkylation studies are presented in Table 1, using the general synthesis described in Scheme 6.  TABLE 1
Alkylation results for gemcabene diethyl ester and analogs.

Using n-hexyllithium or n-butyllithium to generate the LDA produced comparable results. The use of n-hexyllithium is known to be safe and environmentally friendly, therefore such a methodology is largely scalable at multikilogram batches. LiHMDS failed to generate any product. Finally, using larger groups (p-tolyl) on the ester did not hinder the alkylation reaction.
(4) Williamson Ether Synthesis:
Compounds of formula (III) and corresponding salts may be prepared using a Williamson ether synthesis according to Scheme 7. The results for various compounds using the Williamson Ether Synthesis method are listed in Table 2, using the general synthesis described in Scheme 7.  TABLE 2
Williamson Ether Synthesis Results
R21  R22  R23  m  n  X24  Yield (%)
Et  Methyl  Methyl  1  1  Br  0
Et  Methyl  Methyl  1  1  I  trace
t-butyl  Methyl  Methyl  1  1  Br  34%
t-butyl  Methyl  Methyl  1  1  I  40%
During the Williamson ether synthesis, the ethyl esters produced primarily trans-esterification products. Replacing the ethyl ester with t-butyl ester prevented the trans-esterification from occurring. A representative method starting from inexpensive and safe starting materials is outlined in Scheme 7a.
The preparation of alcohol 46 begins with, for example, the alkylation of 6-caprolactone using LDA and iodomethane, followed by ring opening with potassium t-butoxide. Other alkylation methodologies for 6-caprolactone may be used, such as ring opening with t-butoxide. The iodide or the bromide of formula (47) may be directly prepared from the alcohol and coupled by the Williamson ether synthesis methodology.
Exemplary compounds and intermediates that may be prepared by these methods are included in Table 3.  TABLE 3

A representative synthesis of gemcabene is shown in Scheme 8. In this representative example, 4-Chlorobutyl ether was converted into 4-iodobutyl ether 1 with NaI in acetone in 95% yield. The alkyl iodide was treated with ethyl isobutyrate in the presence of LDA, which is freshly prepared from diisopropylamine/n-hexyl lithium or n-butyl lithium, to provide the diester 2 in a high yield. Alternate examples in which the LDA was prepared using either butyllithium or hexyllithium produced comparable yields. The diester 2 was saponified to provide the diacid 3, followed by transformation into gemcabene calcium 4.
Unexpectedly, experiments using 4-chloro- and 4-bromobutyl ethers did not undergo α-alkylation of ethyl isobutyrate to produce diester 2. No evidence of a coupling product was found using 4-chlorobutyl ether as a starting material (Scheme 9).
The use of 4-bromobutyl ether as a starting material resulted in the formation of diester 2, but with different reaction kinetics (Scheme 10).
Reformatsky Approach:
Gemcabene may be prepared using a Reformatsky coupling reaction between ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate and 4-chalobutyl ethers (Scheme 11) under various conditions. These conditions include various solvents (such as THF, methyl-t-butyl ether, and ethyl ether), various types of zinc (zinc powder with catalytic amounts of iodine or chlorotrimethylsilane or highly active Rieke® zinc), and various reaction temperatures between 0° C. to 70° C.
Acid-Catalyzed Ether Synthesis:
Gemcabene may be synthesized by dimerization of alcohols, such as alcohol 7 below, using the by the reaction pathway described in Scheme 12. Alcohol 7 was prepared in two steps by alkylation of benzyl protected 4-bromobutanol with an alkyl isobutyrate, followed by hydrogenation.
Dimerization of alcohol 7 in the presence of various acid catalysts, such as sulfuric acid or nalfion NR50 (acidic resin), in organic solvents, such as ethers or hydrocarbons, may produce gemcabene. This process may result in a complex mixture of products formed due to trans-esterification (Scheme 13).
Williamson Ether Synthesis:
Another representative example of a process for preparing gemcabene is shown in the Willaimson ether synthesis in Scheme 14. Alcohol 7 was treated with sodium hydride in the presence of corresponding bromide 8. Bromide 8 was prepared by alkylating 1,4-dibromobutane with ethyl isobutyrate.
If trans-esterification occurs instead of the expected displacement reaction, the bromide 8 may be converted to the iodide before proceeding with the reaction.
To reduce the trans-esterification products and produce higher yield of the desired products, the ethyl esters may be replaced with sterically-hindered esters, such as, but not limited to, t-butyl esters. A representative example of this process is shown in Scheme 15. In this example, hydrolysis of intermediate 6 to form acid 9, followed by t-butylation in the presence of, for example, isourea 10, produces the t-butyl ester. The protected t-butyl ester 11 can be hydrogenated to afford alcohol 12 (Scheme 15) in quantitative yield.
The corresponding bromide 13 may be prepared by alkylation of 1,4-dibromobutane with t-butyl isobutyrate. The t-butyl isobutyrate may be prepared by trans-esterification of methyl isobutyrate using sodium tert-butoxide in 51% yield according to the literature procedure (Scheme 16).
Alcohol 12 was reacted in with bromide 13 in the presence of hydrating agents, such as, but not limited to sodium hydride, in aprotic dipolar solvents, such as, but not limited to, DMF. In this representative example, gemcabene di-t-butyl ester was obtained by reacting bromide 13 with alcohol 12 in the presence of sodium hydride and DMF at 5° C., followed by warming to room temperature and stirring for 20 hours (Scheme 17).
Unexpectedly, there was no indication of the trans-esterification products. Some unreacted alcohol 12 and bromide 13 were present in the crude NMR, along with some elimination product from the bromide. However, yields and conversions improved with longer reaction times and when using more than 1 equivalent of sodium hydride and bromide.
Bromide 13 was converted to the iodide by refluxing with sodium iodide in acetone. Further, iodide 15 was reacted with alcohol 12, as described in Scheme 18.
The experiment produced slightly higher yield than the bromide. Once again, no trans-esterification side products were present in the crude material. The elimination byproduct was present in higher amounts. The remainder was unreacted alcohol 12 and a trace of the iodide 15. The gemcabene t-butyl diester was converted to gemcabene diacid 3 with 10% TFA in dichloromethane.
Alkylation Method: Other α,ω-Dicarboxylic Acid-Terminated Dialkane Ethers
Synthesis of 6,6′-oxybis(2-methyl-2-(p-tolyl)hexanoic acid)
As shown in Scheme 19, the alkylation process of Scheme 8 in alkylation method may be used to produce other α,ω-dicarboxylic acid-terminated dialkane ethers, such as 6,6′-oxybis(2-methyl-2-(p-tolyl)hexanoic acid) 18. Ethyl p-tolylacetate was α-methylated with iodomethane in the presence of LDA to give the ester 16, followed by α-alkylation with 4-iodobutyl ether with LDA to give the diester 17. The dicarboxylic acid 18 was obtained by saponification of 7 with aqueous KOH in ethanol.
Synthesis of the 5-5, 5-4, 4-3 Analogs of Gemcabene Diethyl Ester
Three analogs of gemcabene diethyl ester (compounds 19, 20, 21 in Scheme 20) were prepared by the alkylation method using the appropriate dibromide compounds.
Each analog was prepared in the same fashion, altering only the dibromide compounds. A representative procedure for preparing compound 21 is shown in Scheme 17.
In the representative example for producing analog 21, propane diol was protected with a THP group to prepare protected alcohol 22. The protected alcohol was reacted with 1,4-dibromobutane in the presence of sodium hydride to prepare bromide 23 after reflux for 20 hours in THF. A significant amount of unreacted alcohol 22 was recovered. Running the reaction in DMF may result in an increased yield. The THP group present in bromide 23 was removed by stirring in methanol with p-toluenesulfonic acid to prepare alcohol 24. The alcohol was converted to the bromide by treatment with carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine to generate the dibromide 25 in 91% yield. Once the dibromide was prepared, the alkylation with ethyl isobutyrate was conducted in the same fashion as with gemcabene in Scheme 4. Ethyl isobutyrate was deprotonated with LDA at −78° C. followed by the addition of dibromide 26, and the reaction was subsequently warmed to room temperature to provide diester 21. The procedures were repeated for compounds 19 and 20. In the case of compound 19, the alkylation with dibromide 26 (Scheme 22) provided diester 19.
A comparable but slightly lower yield was seen in the alkylation with ethyl isobutyrate to prepare analog 20. For each analog, the alkylation produced the desired analogs in favorable yields.
SYNTHETIC EXAMPLES
Example 1: Gemcabene calcium prepared from ethyl isobutyrate according to Scheme 23
In the first step of the reaction, ethyl isobutyrate is deprotonated in the presence of a suitable non-pyrophoric lithium derivative, such as n-hexyllithium, n-heptyllithium, and n-octyllithium. The reaction is performed by either the addition of the halo-ester of formula (6) to the lithiation agent in a suitable solvent, or, conversely, by addition of the lithiation agent to the halo-ester solution in a suitable solvent. To an ethyl isobutyrate solution in a suitable organic solvent is added under stirring approximately 1 to approximately 2.2 eq of the lithium derivative at approximately 2.5 M concentration under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argo gas at a rate of approximately 1.5 moles per hour. The solution is maintained at a constant temperature within the range of approximately −78° C. to approximately −10° C. Optionally, the base is diluted in a suitable organic solvent before addition. Suitable organic solvents include, but are not limited to, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methytetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, benzene, toluene, xylene, hydrocarbon solvents (such as pentane, hexane, and heptane), and mixtures thereof. After addition of the base, the reaction mixture is allowed to stir for approximately 1 hr to approximately 12 hr. Then bis(halobutyl)ether, dissolved in a suitable solvent, is added, preferably at a rate such that the reaction-mixture temperature remains within approximately one to five degrees of the initial reaction-mixture temperature. A suitable bis(halobutyl)ether is a bis(chloro), bis(bromo), or a bis(iodo) ether. These compounds are commercially available, for example, from FCH Group Reagents for Synthesis, or can be prepared as described, for instance, in Mueller R. et al., J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 5183-5197. After completion of the addition, the reaction-mixture temperature can be adjusted to within a temperature range of approximately −20° C. to approximately RT, preferably to approximately RT. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir until the reaction is substantially complete, as determined using an appropriated analytical method, such as thin-layer chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography. Then, the reaction mixture is quenched, and the diester compound of formula (7) is isolated by workup. Gemcabene is then synthesized by reacting the diester of formula (7) with a metal salt, base, or oxide according to the protocol described above for the formation of the α,ω-dicarboxylic acid-terminated dialkane ether salt of formula (IV).

The mixture is stirred at approximately 0° C. to approximately 10° C. until nearly all the zinc has reacted (approximately 3 hr). Alternatively, iodine is added to initiate the reaction. Bis(halobutyl)ether of formula (6) (0.5 eq), is added dropwise to the flask over 1 hr, and the mixture is allowed to warm to 25° C. over several hours, after which time the mixture is heated at 50° C. for 1 hr and cooled. Aqueous ammonium chloride is added to the mixture, and the aqueous layer is extracted with an organic solvent, dried over a drying agent, and evaporated to give the crude product.
