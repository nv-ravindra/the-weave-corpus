BACKGROUND
Complex oligosaccharides are widely recognized to play a critical role in a host of important biological interactions including protein folding, the immune response, cellular recognition, and host-pathogen interactions. Despite their importance, our understanding of the molecular basis of carbohydrate function lags far behind our knowledge of proteomics and genomics. This is predominantly due to a scarcity of homogeneous, well-defined carbohydrates to serve as standards for glycomics analysis. Biological systems produce oligosaccharides as complex and often intractable mixtures, leaving chemical synthesis as the only avenue for the production of homogenous material for study. For a number of reasons, carbohydrate synthesis remains a formidable challenge, despite numerous advances in recent years. Among the issues which plague carbohydrate synthesis, controlling selectivity of glycosylation reactions is one of the most difficult, largely because most methods for chemical glycosylation reactions rely heavily on the substrates to control the diastereoselectivity. In many cases it is difficult to obtain the desired linkages with good selectivity without extensive modifications to both coupling partners, to obtain a “matched” pair. In the absence of native functionality that permits the introduction of directing groups, the problem is greatly magnified. Stereoelectronic effects can be used to facilitate formation of certain linkages, but to date few robust methods to synthesize difficult linkages without recourse to chiral auxiliaries, temporary prosthetic groups, or de novo synthesis exist. These latter approaches necessarily introduce additional steps into carbohydrate synthesis, and they often do not guarantee selectivity with a broad range of substrates.
Compounds comprising so-called “difficult linkages” such as β-linked 2-deoxy-sugars are often essential for the bioactivity of many natural products, including, for example, digitoxin, mithramycin, and landomycin A. Furthermore, oligosaccharides composed of deoxy-sugars have been shown to possess potent biological activity. Altering the composition of these sugars can modulate a natural product's bioactivity, potentially reducing undesirable side effects. This approach has yet to be broadly adapted to drug discovery, however, as these linkages are considered to be among the most challenging to synthesize directly.
Methods for the direct construction of β-linked phenolic glycosides and thioglycosides of 2-deoxy-sugars have been described, but reports of the direct stereoselective synthesis of β-linked 2-deoxy-sugar disaccharides and oligosaccharides are exceedingly rare. Moreover, the mechanistic basis of selectivity in these latter reactions has yet to be elucidated, and selectivity does not always translate well between systems.
Consequently, there is a pressing need for robust and selective glycosylation reactions that work with a range of carbohydrates.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
As part of an ongoing program aimed at developing selective methods for 2-deoxy-sugar synthesis, we chose to examine the in situ generation of different glycosyl sulfonates for β-selective glycosylations. While glycosyl triflates can undergo SN2-like reactions to afford β-linked products with certain substrates, Crich has shown that 2-deoxy glycosyl triflates are generally very unstable. Crich, D.; Vinogradova, O. J. Org. Chem. 71:8473-8480 (2006). Furthermore, it has been reported that even in examples where 2-deoxy-sugar triflates are not subject to decomposition, they only undergo β-selective reactions when strong carbon nucleophiles are employed as acceptors. Krumper, J. R. et al., Org. Lett. 10:4907-4910 (2008); Krumper, J. R. et al., J. Org. Chem. 74:8039-8050 (2009). In principle, a more stable sulfonate should possess greater covalent character, permitting direct SN2 displacement to afford the product as a single diastereomer. While the reactivity of different sulfonates has been reported to span several orders of magnitude, little work has been done on glycosyl sulfonates other than triflates since the seminal studies of the Schuerch and Koto groups over three decades ago. Eby, R. et al., Carbohydr. Res. 34:79-90 (1974); Koto, S. et al., Chem. Lett. 587-588 (1975); Lucas, T. J. et al., Carbohydr. Res. 39:39-45 (1975); Marou{hacek over (s)}ek, V. et al., Carbohydr. Res. 60:85-96 (1978); Srivastava, V. K. et al., Carbohydr. Res. 79:C13-C16 (1980); Koto, S. et al., Bull Chem. Soc. Jpn. 53:1761-1762 (1980); Srivastava, V. K. et al., J. Org. Chem. 46:1121-1126 (1981). This is due to the fact that many of these procedures required the isolation of highly unstable species. Additionally, those procedures for in situ generation of sulfonates often led to non-selective reactions. The lack of selectivity is presumably due to the presence of several other nucleophilic ions in solution, which could scramble the stereochemistry of the anomeric leaving group.
To address these issues, N-sulfonylimidazoles were examined as reagents for converting hemiacetals into glycosyl sulfonates in situ (Scheme 1). These species have been reported to promote sulfonate ester formation and nucleotide coupling without the generation of nucleophilic byproducts. Importantly, the synthesis of N-sulfonylimidazoles is trivial, which would permit the rapid synthesis of a large library of compounds to tune reactivity.
Initial investigations focused on thiol nucleophiles, owing to both their increased reactivity and the fact that thioglycoside linkages are useful non-hydrolyzable carbohydrate mimetics. To this end, deprotonation of 1a with KHMDS in THF at low temperature was followed first by addition of N-tosylimidazole (TsIm), then the nucleophile. The selectivity in the reaction was dependent on the amount of time 1a was allowed to react with the TsIm (Table 1, entries 1-3). Longer reaction times generally led to higher selectivity. Without meaning to be bound to any particular theory or mechanism, we believe the change in selectivity is a result of the rapid formation of a mixture of glycosyl tosylates followed by equilibration to the more stable α-anomer.

aAn equivalent of potassium imidazolide was added to the reaction.
In order to improve the yield of the reaction, the more reactive leaving group found in tosyl 4-nitroimidazole (TsImNO2) was examined. Not only did this reagent improve the yield of the reaction, but a dramatic increase in selectivity from 5:1 β:α to essentially all β (i.e., >90%) was observed (Table 1, entry 4). Finally, the use of a slight excess of the activated donor led to a further increase in yield without compromising selectivity (88%, β only, Table 1, entry 5).
To determine if the lower selectivity observed with TsIm was due to the presence of imidazole interfering with the reaction, the reaction using TsImNO2 was repeated in the presence of an equivalent of potassium imidazolide (Table 1, entry 6). No change in selectivity was observed, indicating that imidazole was only acting as a leaving group. Without meaning to be bound to any particular theory or mechanism, the inventors believe the lower selectivity with TsIm is a result of incomplete conversion of the donor to the glycosyl sulfonate prior to the addition of the acceptor. If acceptor is present before the sulfonate can equilibrate to the more stable α configuration, β-sulfonates will be present and react to reduce selectivity.
The scope of the reaction was next examined with several thiol acceptors (Table 2). For aliphatic thiol acceptors it was found to be helpful to use the potassium salt to obtain useful yields. Yields were generally moderate-to-good, with the secondary galactose derived thiol 4 providing the highest yield. In the case of primary thiol 6 the reaction was accompanied by significant amounts of disulfide bond formation, despite efforts to rigorously exclude oxygen from the reaction. In every single case, however, the reaction provided the product essentially as a single β-anomer, as determined by 1H NMR.  TABLE 2

Having established that the reaction was effective with thiolates, we turned our attention to phenoxide nucleophiles, since aryloxy glycosides are an important structural motif in many natural products. The reaction of 1 with TsImNO2, followed by the addition of the potassium salt of 2-naphthol (prepared by treating the acceptor with KHMDS), provided the desired product as a single anomer as determined by 1H NMR (Table 3, entry 1). Rationalizing that a solvent which could better coordinate the counterion could provide the product in enhanced yield, the use of diglyme as additive was next examined. Pleasingly, this led to an increase in the yield, affording the product in 76% as a single anomer (Table 3, entry 2). Under these conditions no glycal formation was observed, indicating that elimination of the active leaving group was not a competitive pathway. Other phenolic acceptors reacted in moderate-to-good yield, with electron-rich phenols providing the best yields.  TABLE 3

The more reactive 2,6-dideoxy-L-arabino hexopyranose donor 11 (Table 4) was also studied. Again no glycal formation was observed. Interestingly, electron-rich phenols were less effective than electron-poor phenols with this substrate, representing a reversal of the trend observed in Table 3. While the lower yields can be attributed to be due in part to the decreased stability of the 2,6-dideoxy-sugars products, the origin of this reversal in reactivity trends is unclear at this point. Importantly however, the reactions again afforded the products essentially exclusively as β-anomers, despite the fact that the absolute configuration of the donor had been switched from D- to L-. These observations support our hypothesis that TsImNO2 activates the hemiacetal donors as α-glycosyl tosylates, which react through an SN2-like manifold to afford β-linked products.  TABLE 4

With aliphatic aliphatic acceptors, our preliminary investigations again focused on using the tosyl imidazole reagents. Activation of the potassium alkoxide of hemiacetal 1a with N-tosyl-4-nitroimidazole and subsequent addition of the primary alkoxide acceptor 102a led to the formation of the desired disaccharide 103a in moderate yield (57%), essentially as a single β-anomer (Table 5, entry 1). Attempts to improve this yield by adjusting the donor and acceptor stoichiometry, reaction temperature, and the sulfonylating agents employed proved to be ineffective (Table 5, entries 2-6). Reasoning that a more potent sulfonylating agent would permit higher yields through more complete conversion of the hemiacetal to the glycosyl sulfonate at low temperature, we turned our attention to p-toluenesulfonic anhydride. These conditions afforded product 103a in 83% yield essentially as a single anomer (Table 5, entry 7).  TABLE 5

Sulfonylating Agents
Having established highly favorable reaction conditions, we turned our attention to the scope of the glycosylation. The 3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-D-glucose “armed” hemiacetal donor reacted smoothly with hindered secondary alcoholic acceptors 102b-102d ( FIG. 2B ) to afford products 103b-103d in good yields (62-74%). Importantly, all of the reactions proceeded with essentially complete β-stereoselectivity ( FIG. 2C ). Surprisingly, acceptors possessing acetonides afforded products 103e and 103f in lower yields, despite the basic nature of the reaction conditions. The reactions were still highly stereoselective, however, indicating that these groups do not interfere with the selectivity of the reaction.
We next examined the more reactive 2,6-dideoxy-L-arabino hexopyranose donor 1b, which represents a common motif in many bioactive natural products. Under these conditions, elimination was once again not a problem, and we were able to obtain β-linked products with a very high degree of stereoselectivity ( FIG. 2D ). The primary glucose-derived alcoholic acceptor 102a reacted to afford 104a in 77% yield, while the more hindered secondary acceptors 102c and 102d afforded products 104c and 104d in 68% and 70% yield, respectively. Again, acetonide-protected acceptor 102e was less effective in the reaction, providing disaccharide 104e in moderate yield (46%).
If the reaction were proceeding through an SN1-manifold, changing the absolute configuration of one of the coupling partners would be expected to alter its stereochemical outcome. Since both D- and L-configured deoxy-donors react to form essentially exclusively β-linked products, this study demonstrates that the reaction is not subject to stereochemical “match” and “mismatch” between donors and acceptors of different configurations. Without meaning to be bound to any particular theory or mechanism, the studies outlined in FIG. 1 point to the reaction proceeding through the intermediacy of an α-glycosyl tosylate that reacts through an SN2-manifold. Furthermore, the data supports our hypothesis that the stereochemical outcome of the reaction is entirely under control of the promoter.
In order to establish the intermediacy of an α-glycosyl tosylate, we turned to low-temperature NMR. Treating the potassium alkoxide of hemiacetal 1a with p-toluenesulfonic anhydride at −78° C. resulted in the quantitative formation of a new species possessing a broad singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum with a chemical shift of δ 6.11 ppm. This is consistent with the anomeric proton of a α-glycosyl tosylate. To further establish the identity of this species, we examined its low-temperature 1H-13C Heteronuclear Single-Quantum Correlation (HSQC) NMR spectrum. This experiment revealed that the proton at δ 6.11 ppm correlated with a 13C NMR signal at δ 102.3 ppm, which is consistent with an anomeric carbon ( FIG. 3 ). Together these experiments indicate that the reaction conditions rapidly and essentially quantitatively convert the hemiacetal to the corresponding α-glycosyl tosylate at low temperature. This particular intermediate 2-deoxy glucosyl tosylate persisted for nearly 2 hours at −78° C. without any indication of decomposition or anomerization ( FIG. 4A ). The tosylate was stable up to temperatures up to −5° C. ( FIG. 4B ), but it appears to eliminate rapidly to form the corresponding glucal above this threshold ( FIG. 4C ). The experiments further corroborate our proposed mechanism in which the hemiacetal is converted to an α-glycosyl tosylate that reacts through an SN2-mechanism.

Products were visualized using UV or by staining with 5% aqueous sulfuric acid or ceric ammonium molybdate. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer at 500 MHz for 1H NMR and 125 MHz for 13C NMR, and 500 MHz for Gradient HSQC. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) (for 1H NMR in CDCl3) or CDCl3 (for 13C NMR in CDCl3). For 1H NMR spectra, data are reported as follows: shift, multiplicity [s=singlet, m=multiplet, t=triplet, d=doublet, dd=doublet of doublets, ddd=doublet of doublet of doublets, dt=doublet of triplets, td=triplet of doublets, q=quartet], coupling constants are reported in Hz. Low resolution mass spectra (LRMS) were obtained using a Finnigan LTQ ESI-MS with an additional APCI source. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Chemistry instrumentation facility using a peak-matching protocol to determine the mass and error range of the molecular ion. Optical rotations were measured on a Rudolph Research Analysis AUTOPUL IV polarimeter in a 5 cm cell at 23-24° C., and concentrations are reported in grams per 100 mL, with reference to the sodium D line at 589 nm.
Materials
Prior to running the glycosylation reactions, all donors and acceptors were dried twice by azeotropic removal of water using toluene and a rotary evaporator at <40° C. Solvents for reactions were dried on an Innovative Technologies PureSolv 400 solvent purifier. NMR solvents were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Labs. Compounds 1a, and 17; tosyl 4-nitroimidazole; compounds 4, 5, and 6; glycosyl donors 1a and 1b; and glycosyl acceptors 102a-102d were synthesized according to literature procedures. All other chemicals were purchased at the highest possible purity from Carbosynth, TCI, Alfa Aesar, and Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The 5 mm Low Pressure/Vacuum Valve NMR tube used for low-temperature NMR experiments was purchased from Wilmad LabGlass.

A solution of donor 1a (21.7 mg, 0.050 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylpyrimidine (TTBP, 13.0 mg, 0.050 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) in 0.50 mL THF-d8 was cooled to −78° C. in a dry ice/acetone bath and treated dropwise with potassium hexamethyldisilazane (1 M in THF, 50.0 μL, 0.050 mmol, 1.0 equiv.). After 15 minutes, a solution of p-toluenesulfonic anhydride (17.1 mg, 0.053 mmol, 1.05 equiv.) in 0.50 mL THF-d8 was added rapidly to the reaction. The reaction was maintained at −78° C. for 30 min, transferred by syringe to a pre-cooled 5 mm Low Pressure/Vacuum Valve NMR tube, and promptly inserted into the NMR instrument probe pre-cooled to −78° C. for 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 2D-Gradient HSQC data acquisition. The temperature was maintained for 2 hours, then warmed by 10 degrees every 10 minutes. At each 10 minute interval, the 1H NMR spectrum was recorded. At −78° C., a single compound was present in the spectrum. At −5° C., the spectrum began to show trace elimination of the tosylate to the corresponding glucal. Significant glucal was present at 25-78° C.
