FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to compounds of formula (I) (as described herein), processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, and methods for their use for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of the diseases or disorders which are mediated by GPR120 receptor.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Metabolic diseases or disorders are caused by an abnormal metabolic process and may either be congenital due to an inherited enzyme abnormality or acquired due to a disease of an endocrine organ or failure of a metabolically important organ such as the liver or the pancreas.
Among the metabolic disorders, diabetes mellitus is the most prevalent and is considered to be one of the five leading causes of death in the world (Diabetes Care, vol. 27, 2004, pp. 1047-1053). Diabetes mellitus is typically classified into two main subtypes: Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (otherwise known as Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus, IDDM), which generally occurs in adolescents under 20 years of age, is an auto-immune disease causing an insulitis with the subsequent destruction of insulin-producing β-cells of the pancreas. Further, in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), β-cells are destroyed due to autoimmune attack. The subsequent lack of insulin leads to elevated levels of blood and urine glucose (hyperglycemia). Although the exact trigger for this autoimmune response is not known, patients with Type 1 diabetes have high levels of antibodies against pancreatic beta cells (hereinafter “beta cells”). However, it cannot be ascertained that all patients with high levels of these antibodies develop Type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes mellitus or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is developed when human muscle, fat and liver cells are not able to respond normally to insulin that body secretes. This inability to respond, otherwise known as insulin resistance, may be due to restriction on the numbers of insulin receptors on these cells, or a dysfunctional behaviour of signalling pathways within the cells, or both. Initially, the β-cells which are responsible for the production of insulin, compensate for this insulin resistance by increasing their insulin secretion. However, these cells gradually become unable to produce enough insulin to facilitate the normal glucose homeostasis, causing the progression to Type 2 diabetes (Am J Med. 108(6), Supplement 1, 2000, pp. 2S-8S). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterised by fasting hyperglycemia which occurs as an effect of the combined lesions of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. There are two types of defects associated with the β-cells: the first component, an increase in the basal insulin release which usually occurs in the presence of low, non-stimulatory glucose concentrations. The second component is a failure to enhance the insulin release in response to a hyperglycaemic challenge.
Obesity is another risk factor for developing metabolic diseases or disorders such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and an increased mortality. Diabetes caused by insulin resistance and obesity are part of the “metabolic syndrome” which is defined as the linkage between several diseases (also referred to as syndrome X, insulin-resistance syndrome, or deadly quartet). These often occur in the same patients and are major risk factors for the development of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (Frontiers in Endocrinology, vol. 4, 2013, pp. 1-11). It has been suggested that the control of lipid levels and/or glucose levels is required to treat type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Even though lifestyle changes like exercise and healthy diet are regarded as the most efficient ways to prevent and manage the disease, pharmaceutical intervention is frequently necessary.
Current treatment options for diabetes, particularly T2D include use of hypoglycaemic agents and insulin. Metformin is one such hypoglycemic agent which is used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. It is, in fact, one of the oldest drugs used for the treatment of T2D and it still remains the drug of choice despite associated gastrointestinal (GI) side effects including anorexia, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting commonly associated with it. In fact, metformin should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment because of the slight risk of lactic acidosis. Sulfonylureas (SUs) e.g. glimepiride, glipizide, are insulin secretagogues, which act on β-cells to increase insulin release, are commonly used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. However, use of sulfonylureas is also associated with adverse effects in that they increase the risk of hypoglycaemia and lead to weight gain. Insulin treatment which is chosen by patients carries the same side-effects. Thiazolidinedione compounds e.g. rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, are insulin sensitizers which bind to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in cells and thereby increase the insulin sensitivity. Though, thiazolidinedione compounds have also been widely used, the enhanced risks of cardiovascular disease and hepatotoxicity have resulted in stringent limitations on their use. Relatively recently, regulatory authorities approved new classes of anti-diabetic agents such as GLP-1 agonists (exenatide and liraglutide) and DPP-4 inhibitors (linagliptin and alogliptin).
It is a known fact that metabolic processes are regulated by fatty acids which are important biological molecules that serve both as a source of energy and as signalling molecules. Generally, it is believed that fatty acids produce their biological effects through interacting with intracellular targets including, for example, the family of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). However, in the recent years it has become clear that fatty acids also serve as agonists for a group of cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Free fatty acids (FFAs) have been demonstrated to act as ligands of several GPCRs including GPR40 (FFAR1), GPR43, GPR84, GPR119 and GPR120. One of the GPCR namely GPR40 facilitates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, whereas the other GPCR namely GPR120 regulates the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in the intestine, as well as insulin sensitivity in macrophages. GPR120 is localized to intestinal enteroendocrine cells, such as colonic L cells. Certain research studies conducted relative recently, identified that loss-of-function GPR120 human variant is associated with obesity, diabetes and other insulin resistance, and related metabolic disorders and also with inflammatory disorders. These findings establish GPR120 as a potential target for the treatment of diabetes, other metabolic disorders and also, inflammatory disorders (Trends Pharmacol Sci. vol. 32(9), 2011 pp. 543-550).
Thus, in view of the role of GPR120 receptor in potentiating metabolic disorders such as diabetes and also, inflammatory disorders, there is need in the art to develop compounds that act by modulating the GPR120 receptor pathways.

Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable organic base addition salts of the compounds of the present invention include those derived from organic bases like lysine, arginine, guanidine, diethanolamine, metformin or other organic bases known to the person skilled in the art.
When the compounds of Formula (I) of the present invention contain one or more basic groups, they can form an addition salt with an inorganic or an organic acid. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like boric acid, perchloric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydriodic acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, monohydrogencarbonic acid, phosphoric acid, monohydrogenphosphoric acid, dihydrogenphosphoric acid, monohydrogensulfuric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphorous acids or other inorganic acids known to the person skilled in the art. Furthermore, examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include the salts derived from organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, ascorbic, maleic acid, malonic acid, benzoic acid, succinic acid, suberic acid, fumaric acid, mandelic acid, phthalic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, naphthoic acid, camphoric acid or other organic acids known to the person skilled in the art. Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the subject compound i.e. the compound of Formula (I) which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally the salts are prepared by contacting the free base or acid with desired salt-forming inorganic or organic acid or a base in a suitable solvent or dispersant or by anion exchange or cation exchange with other salts. Suitable solvents are, for example, ethyl acetate, ethers, alcohols, acetone, or mixtures of these solvents.
Those skilled in the art will recognize that the compounds of Formula (I) of the present invention contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms, as racemic mixtures of enantiomers, mixtures of diastereomers or enantiomerically or optically pure compounds. The term “chiral” refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image cohort, while the term “achiral” refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers and enantiomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, geometric isomers form part of the present invention.
When the compounds of Formula (I) of the present invention contain one chiral center, the compounds exist in two enantiomeric forms and the present invention includes both enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers, such as the specific 50:50 mixture referred to as a racemic mixtures. The enantiomers can be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may be separated, for example, by crystallization (see, CRC Handbook of Optical Resolutions via Diastereomeric Salt Formation by David Kozma (CRC Press, 2001)); formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic esterification; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support for example silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. It will be appreciated that where the desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step is required to liberate the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively, specific enantiomers may be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer into the other by asymmetric transformation. Designation of a specific absolute configuration at a chiral carbon of the compounds of the invention is understood to mean that the designated enantiomeric form of the compounds is in enantiomeric excess (ee) or in other words is substantially free from the other enantiomer. For example, the “R” forms of the compounds are substantially free from the “S” forms of the compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the “S” forms. Conversely, “S” forms of the compounds are substantially free of “R” forms of the compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the “R” forms. Enantiomeric excess, as used herein, is the presence of a particular enantiomer at greater than 50%. In a particular embodiment when a specific absolute configuration is designated, the enantiomeric excess of depicted compounds is at least about 90%. When a compound of Formula (I) of the present invention has two or more chiral carbons it can have more than two optical isomers and can exist in diastereoisomeric forms. For example, when there are two chiral carbons, the compound can have up to 4 optical isomers and 2 pairs of enantiomers ((S,S)/(R,R) and (R,S)/(S,R)). The pairs of enantiomers (e.g., (S,S)/(R,R)) are mirror image stereoisomers of one another. The stereoisomers that are not mirror-images (e.g., (S,S) and (R,S)) are diastereomers. The diastereoisomeric pairs may be separated by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example chromatography or crystallization and the individual enantiomers within each pair may be separated as described above. The present invention includes each diastereoisomer of such compounds and mixtures thereof.
The isotopically labeled forms of compounds of Formula (I), can be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described above or in the subsequent section on examples by using a corresponding isotopically labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent.
In one embodiment, the compounds of Formula (I) exists as tautomers, and it is intended to encompass all the tautomeric forms of the compounds within the scope of the present invention.

Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms.
It is further intended to encompass various polymorphs of compounds of Formula (I) within the scope of the present invention. Various polymorphs of compounds of the present invention can be prepared by standard crystallisation procedures known in the art. The crystallisation technique employed can utilize various solvents or their mixtures, temperature conditions and various modes of cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow cooling. The presence of polymorphs can be determined by IR (Infra-red) spectroscopy, solid probe NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction or such other standard techniques.
Furthermore, the present invention also includes prodrugs of the compounds of Formula (I). The prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention are derivatives of the aforesaid compounds of the invention which upon administration to a subject in need thereof undergoes chemical conversion by metabolic or chemical processes to release the parent drug in vivo from which the prodrug is derived. The preferred prodrugs are pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivatives e.g., alkyl esters, cycloalkyl esters, alkenyl esters, benzyl esters, mono- or di-substituted alkyl esters convertible by solvolysis under physiological conditions to the parent carboxylic acid, and those conventionally used in the art.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which the insulin-producing β-cells of the pancreas are destroyed which generally results in an absolute deficiency of insulin, the hormone that regulates glucose utilization. Type 2 diabetes often occurs in the face of normal or even elevated levels of insulin and can result from the inability of tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. Other categories of diabetes include gestational diabetes (a state of hyperglycemia which develops during pregnancy) and “other” rarer causes (genetic syndromes, acquired processes such as pancreatitis, diseases such as cystic fibrosis, exposure to certain drugs, viruses, and unknown causes). In an embodiment, diabetes refers to Type 2 diabetes.
