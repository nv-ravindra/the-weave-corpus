The present disclosure generally relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 protein/protein interaction. Provided herein are compounds, compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of their use. The disclosure further pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound according to the disclosure that are useful for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer and infectious diseases.
Programmed death-1 (CD279) is a receptor on T cells that has been shown to suppress activating signals from the T cell receptor when bound by either of its ligands, Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274, B7-H1) or PD-L2 (CD273, B7-DC) (Sharpe et al., Nat. Imm. 2007). When PD-1 expressing T cells contact cells expressing its ligands, functional activities in response to antigenic stimuli, including proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxicity are reduced. PD-1/PD-Ligand interactions down regulate immune responses during resolution of an infection or tumor, or during the development of self tolerance (Keir M e, Butte M J, Freeman G J, et al. PD-1 and its ligands in tolerance and immunity. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: Epub). Chronic antigen stimulation, such as that which occurs during tumor disease or chronic infections, results in T cells that express elevated levels of PD-1 and are dysfunctional with respect to activity towards the chronic antigen (reviewed in Kim and Ahmed, Curr Opin Imm, 2010). This is termed “T cell exhaustion”. B cells also display PD-1/PD-ligand suppression and “exhaustion”.
Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 ligation using antibodies to PD-L1 has been shown to restore and augment T cell activation in many systems. Patients with advanced cancer benefit from therapy with a monoclonal antibody to PD-L1 (Brahmer et al., New Engl J Med 2012). Preclinical animal models of tumors and chronic infections have shown that blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by monoclonal antibodies can enhance the immune response and result in tumor rejection or control of infection. Antitumor immunotherapy via PD-1/PD-L1 blockade may augment therapeutic immune response to a number of histologically distinct tumors (Dong H, Chen L. B7-H1 pathway and its role in the Evasion of tumor immunity. J Mol Med. 2003; 81(5):281-287; Dong H, Strome S E, Salamoa D R, et al. Tumor-associated B7-H1 promotes T-cell apoptosis: a potential mechanism of immune evasion. Nat Med. 2002; 8(8):793-800).
Interference with the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction has also shown enhanced T cell activity in chronic infection systems. Chronic lymphocytic chorio meningitis virus infection of mice also exhibits improved virus clearance and restored immunity with blockade of PD-L1 (Barber D L, Wherry E J, Masopust D, et al. Restoring function in exhausted CD8 T cells during chronic viral infection. Nature. 2006; 439(7077):682-687). Humanized mice infected with HIV-1 show enhanced protection against viremia and viral depletion of CD4+ T cells (Palmer et al., J. Immunol 2013). Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 through monoclonal antibodies to PD-L1 can restore in vitro antigen-specific functionality to T cells from HIV patients (Day, Nature 2006; Petrovas, J. Exp. Med. 2006; Trautman, Nature Med. 2006; D'Souza, J. Immunol. 2007; Zhang, Blood 2007; Kaufmann, Nature Imm. 2007; Kasu, J. Immunol. 2010; Porichis, Blood 2011), HCV patients [Golden-Mason, J. Virol. 2007; Jeung, J. Leuk. Biol. 2007; Urbani, J. Hepatol. 2008; Nakamoto, PLoS Path. 2009; Nakamoto, Gastroenterology 2008] or HBV patients (Boni, J. Virol. 2007; Fisicaro, Gastro. 2010; Fisicaro et al., Gastroenterology, 2012; Boni et al., Gastro., 2012; Penna et al., J. Hep., 2012; Raziorrough, Hepatology 2009; Liang, World J Gastro. 2010; Zhang, Gastro. 2008).
In addition to enhancing immunologic responses to chronic antigens, blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has also been shown to enhance responses to vaccination, including therapeutic vaccination in the context of chronic infection (S. J. Ha, S. N. Mueller, E. J. Wherry et al., “Enhancing therapeutic vaccination by blocking PD-1-mediated inhibitory signals during chronic infection,” The Journal of Experimental Medicine, vol. 205, no. 3, pp. 543-555, 2008; A. C. Finnefrock, A. Tang, F. Li et al., “PD-1 blockade in rhesus macaques: impact on chronic infection and prophylactic vaccination,” The Journal of Immunology, vol. 182, no. 2, pp. 980-987, 2009; M.-Y. Song, S.-H. Park, H. J. Nam, D.-H. Choi, and Y.-C. Sung, “Enhancement of vaccine-induced primary and memory CD8+ t-cell responses by soluble PD-1,” The Journal of Immunotherapy, vol. 34, no. 3, pp. 297-306, 2011).
The PD-1 pathway is a key inhibitory molecule in T cell exhaustion that arises from chronic antigen stimulation during chronic infections and tumor disease. Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction through targeting the PD-L1 protein has been shown to restore antigen-specific T cell immune functions in vitro and in vivo, including enhanced responses to vaccination in the setting of tumor or chronic infection.
Accordingly, agents that block the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 are desired.

The present disclosure may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof. This disclosure encompasses all combinations of the aspects and/or embodiments of the disclosure noted herein. It is understood that any and all embodiments of the present disclosure may be taken in conjunction with any other embodiment or embodiments to describe additional embodiments. It is also to be understood that each individual element of the embodiments is meant to be combined with any and all other elements from any embodiment to describe an additional embodiment.
The features and advantages of the disclosure may be more readily understood by those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description. It is to be appreciated that certain features of the disclosure that are, for clarity reasons, described above and below in the context of separate embodiments, may also be combined to form a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the disclosure that are, for brevity reasons, described in the context of a single embodiment, may also be combined so as to form sub-combinations thereof. Embodiments identified herein as exemplary or preferred are intended to be illustrative and not limiting.
Unless specifically stated otherwise herein, references made in the singular may also include the plural. For example, “a” and “an” may refer to either one, or one or more.
As used herein, the phase “compound(s) or salts thereof” refers to at least one compound, at least one salt of the compounds, or a combination thereof. For example, compounds of Formula (I) or salts thereof includes a compound of Formula (I); two compounds of Formula (I); a salt of a compound of Formula (I); a compound of Formula (I) and one or more salts of the compound of Formula (I); and two or more salts of a compound of Formula (I).
Unless otherwise indicated, any atom with unsatisfied valences is assumed to have hydrogen atoms sufficient to satisfy the valences.
Listed below are definitions of various terms used to describe the present disclosure. These definitions apply to the terms as they are used throughout the specification (unless they are otherwise limited in specific instances) either individually or as part of a larger group. The definitions set forth herein take precedence over definitions set forth in any patent, patent application, and/or patent application publication incorporated herein by reference.
Throughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof may be chosen by one skilled in the field to provide stable moieties and compounds.
The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
The compounds of Formula (I) can form salts which are also within the scope of this disclosure. Unless otherwise indicated, reference to an inventive compound is understood to include reference to one or more salts thereof. The term “salt(s)” denotes acidic and/or basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids and bases. In addition, the term “salt(s) may include zwitterions (inner salts), e.g., when a compound of Formula (I) contains both a basic moiety, such as an amine or a pyridine or imidazole ring, and an acidic moiety, such as a carboxylic acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, such as, for example, acceptable metal and amine salts in which the cation does not contribute significantly to the toxicity or biological activity of the salt. However, other salts may be useful, e.g., in isolation or purification steps which may be employed during preparation, and thus, are contemplated within the scope of the disclosure. Salts of the compounds of the formula (I) may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of the Formula (I) with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.
Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates (such as those formed with acetic acid or trihaloacetic acid, for example, trifluoroacetic acid), adipates, alginates, ascorbates, aspartates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, cyclopentanepropionates, digluconates, dodecylsulfates, ethanesulfonates, fumarates, glucoheptanoates, glycerophosphates, hemisulfates, heptanoates, hexanoates, hydrochlorides (formed with hydrochloric acid), hydrobromides (formed with hydrogen bromide), hydroiodides, maleates (formed with maleic acid), 2-hydroxyethanesulfonates, lactates, methanesulfonates (formed with methanesulfonic acid), 2-naphthalenesulfonates, nicotinates, nitrates, oxalates, pectinates, persulfates, 3-phenylpropionates, phosphates, picrates, pivalates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates (such as those formed with sulfuric acid), sulfonates (such as those mentioned herein), tartrates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates such as tosylates, undecanoates, and the like.
Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts; barium, zinc, and aluminum salts; salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as trialkylamines such as triethylamine, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-benzyl-β-phenethylamine, 1-ephenamine, N,N′-dibenzylethylene-diamine, dehydroabietylamine, N-ethylpiperidine, benzylamine, dicyclohexylamine or similar pharmaceutically acceptable amines and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g., dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g., decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g., benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others. Preferred salts include monohydrochloride, hydrogensulfate, methanesulfonate, phosphate or nitrate salts.
The compounds of Formula (I) can be provided as amorphous solids or crystalline solids. Lyophilization can be employed to provide the compounds of Formula (I) as a solid.
It should further be understood that solvates (e.g., hydrates) of the compounds of Formula (I) are also within the scope of the present disclosure. The term “solvate” means a physical association of a compound of Formula (I) with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. “Solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvates include hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, isopropanolates, acetonitrile solvates, and ethyl acetate solvates. Methods of solvation are known in the art.
Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art and are described in:
a) The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Camille G. Wermuth et al., Ch 31, (Academic Press, 1996);
b) Design of Prodrugs, edited by H. Bundgaard, (Elsevier, 1985);
c) A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, P. Krogsgaard-Larson and H. Bundgaard, eds. Ch 5, pgs 113-191 (Harwood Academic Publishers, 1991); and
d) Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism, Bernard Testa and Joachim M. Mayer, (Wiley-VCH, 2003).
In addition, compounds of Formula (I), subsequent to their preparation, can be isolated and purified to obtain a composition containing an amount by weight equal to or greater than 99% of a compound of Formula (I) (“substantially pure”), which is then used or formulated as described herein. Such “substantially pure” compounds of Formula (I) are also contemplated herein as part of the present disclosure.
“Stable compound” and “stable structure” are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. The present disclosure is intended to embody stable compounds.
“Therapeutically effective amount” is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present disclosure alone or an amount of the combination of compounds claimed or an amount of a compound of the present disclosure in combination with other active ingredients effective to act as an inhibitor of PD-1, or effective to treat or prevent cancer or chronic infection, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
As used herein, “treating” or “treatment” cover the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, and include: (a) preventing the disease-state from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the disease-state but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease-state, i.e., arresting its development; and/or (c) relieving the disease-state, i.e., causing regression of the disease state.
The compounds of the present disclosure are intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium (D) and tritium (T). Isotopes of carbon include 13C and 14C. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the disclosure can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. For example, methyl (—CH3) also includes deuterated methyl groups such as —CD3.
Compounds in accordance with Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered by any means suitable for the condition to be treated, which can depend on the need for site-specific treatment or quantity of Formula (I) compound to be delivered. Also embraced within this disclosure is a class of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; and one or more non-toxic, pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and/or diluents and/or adjuvants (collectively referred to herein as “carrier” materials) and, if desired, other active ingredients. The compounds of Formula (I) may be administered by any suitable route, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended. The compounds and compositions of the present disclosure may, for example, be administered orally, mucosally, or parentally including intravascularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, and intrasternally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles. For example, the pharmaceutical carrier may contain a mixture of mannitol or lactose and microcrystalline cellulose. The mixture may contain additional components such as a lubricating agent, e.g. magnesium stearate and a disintegrating agent such as crospovidone. The carrier mixture may be filled into a gelatin capsule or compressed as a tablet. The pharmaceutical composition may be administered as an oral dosage form or an infusion, for example.
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, liquid capsule, suspension, or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient. For example, the pharmaceutical composition may be provided as a tablet or capsule comprising an amount of active ingredient in the range of from about 0.1 to 1000 mg, preferably from about 0.25 to 250 mg, and more preferably from about 0.5 to 100 mg. A suitable daily dose for a human or other mammal may vary widely depending on the condition of the patient and other factors, but, can be determined using routine methods.
Any pharmaceutical composition contemplated herein can, for example, be delivered orally via any acceptable and suitable oral preparations. Exemplary oral preparations, include, but are not limited to, for example, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous and oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard and soft capsules, liquid capsules, syrups, and elixirs.

While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it may comprise a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Suitable emulsifying agents include, but are not limited to, for example, naturally-occurring phosphatides, e.g., soy bean lecithin; esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, such as, for example, sorbitan monooleate; and condensation products of partial esters with ethylene oxide, such as, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make-up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. An emulsion can also contain a sweetening agent, a flavoring agent, a preservative, and/or an antioxidant. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present disclosure include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or other materials well known in the art.
The compounds of Formula (I) and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can, for example, also be delivered intravenously, subcutaneously, and/or intramuscularly via any pharmaceutically acceptable and suitable injectable form. Exemplary injectable forms include, but are not limited to, for example, sterile aqueous solutions comprising acceptable vehicles and solvents, such as, for example, water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution; sterile oil-in-water microemulsions; and aqueous or oleaginous suspensions.
Formulations for parenteral administration may be in the form of aqueous or non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or suspensions. These solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders or granules using one or more of the carriers or diluents mentioned for use in the formulations for oral administration or by using other suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The compounds may be dissolved in water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, tragacanth gum, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well and widely known in the pharmaceutical art. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition with suitable carriers including saline, dextrose, or water, or with cyclodextrin (i.e. Captisol), cosolvent solubilization (i.e. propylene glycol) or micellar solubilization (i.e. Tween 80).
The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.
A sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion can, for example, be prepared by 1) dissolving at least one compound of Formula (I) in an oily phase, such as, for example, a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin; 2) combining the Formula (I) containing oil phase with a water and glycerol mixture; and 3) processing the combination to form a microemulsion.
A sterile aqueous or oleaginous suspension can be prepared in accordance with methods already known in the art. For example, a sterile aqueous solution or suspension can be prepared with a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, such as, for example, 1,3-butane diol; and a sterile oleaginous suspension can be prepared with a sterile non-toxic acceptable solvent or suspending medium, such as, for example, sterile fixed oils, e.g., synthetic mono- or diglycerides; and fatty acids, such as, for example, oleic acid.
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this disclosure include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) such as d-alpha-tocopherol polyethyleneglycol 1000 succinate, surfactants used in pharmaceutical dosage forms such as Tweens, polyethoxylated castor oil such as CREMOPHOR surfactant (BASF), or other similar polymeric delivery matrices, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat. Cyclodextrins such as alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrin, or chemically modified derivatives such as hydroxyalkylcyclodextrins, including 2- and 3-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrins, or other solubilized derivatives may also be advantageously used to enhance delivery of compounds of the formulae described herein.
The pharmaceutically active compounds of this disclosure can be processed in accordance with conventional methods of pharmacy to produce medicinal agents for administration to patients, including humans and other mammals. The pharmaceutical compositions may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization and/or may contain conventional adjuvants, such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, buffers etc. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.
The amounts of compounds that are administered and the dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and/or compositions of this disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex, the medical condition of the subject, the type of disease, the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of administration, and the particular compound employed. Thus, the dosage regimen may vary widely, but can be determined routinely using standard methods. A daily dose of about 0.001 to 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably between about 0.0025 and about 50 mg/kg body weight and most preferably between about 0.005 to 10 mg/kg body weight, may be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day. Other dosing schedules include one dose per week and one dose per two day cycle.
For therapeutic purposes, the active compounds of this disclosure are ordinarily combined with one or more adjuvants appropriate to the indicated route of administration. If administered orally, the compounds may be admixed with lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia gum, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and then tableted or encapsulated for convenient administration. Such capsules or tablets may contain a controlled-release formulation as may be provided in a dispersion of active compound in hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.
Pharmaceutical compositions of this disclosure comprise at least one compound of Formula (I) and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and optionally an additional agent selected from any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, and vehicle. Alternate compositions of this disclosure comprise a compound of the Formula (I) described herein, or a prodrug thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle.
The compounds of the disclosure inhibit the PD-1/PDL-1 protein/protein interaction, resulting in a PD-1 blockade. The blockade of PD-1 can enhance the immune response to cancerous cells and infectious diseases in mammals, including humans. In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to treatment of a subject in vivo using a compound of Formula (I) or a salt thereof such that growth of cancerous tumors is inhibited. A compound of Formula (I) or a salt thereof may be used alone to inhibit the growth of cancerous tumors. Alternatively, a compound of Formula (I) or a salt thereof may be used in conjunction with other immunogenic agents or standard cancer treatments, as described below.
In one embodiment, the disclosure provides a method of inhibiting growth of tumor cells in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a salt thereof.
In one embodiment, a method is provided for treating cancer comprising administering to a patient in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a salt thereof. Examples of cancers include those whose growth may be inhibited using compounds of the disclosure include cancers typically responsive to immunotherapy. Non-limiting examples of preferred cancers for treatment include melanoma (e.g., metastatic malignant melanoma), renal cancer (e.g. clear cell carcinoma), prostate cancer (e.g. hormone refractory prostate adenocarcinoma), breast cancer, colon cancer and lung cancer (e.g. non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, the disclosure includes refractory or recurrent malignancies whose growth may be inhibited using the compounds of the disclosure.
Examples of other cancers that may be treated using the methods of the disclosure include bone cancer, pancreatic cancer, skin cancer, cancer of the head or neck, cutaneous or intraocular malignant melanoma, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, rectal cancer, cancer of the anal region, stomach cancer, testicular cancer, uterine cancer, carcinoma of the fallopian tubes, carcinoma of the endometrium, carcinoma of the cervix, carcinoma of the vagina, carcinoma of the vulva, Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the small intestine, cancer of the endocrine system, cancer of the thyroid gland, cancer of the parathyroid gland, cancer of the adrenal gland, sarcoma of soft tissue, cancer of the urethra, cancer of the penis, chronic or acute leukemias including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, solid tumors of childhood, lymphocytic lymphoma, cancer of the bladder, cancer of the kidney or urethra, carcinoma of the renal pelvis, neoplasm of the central nervous system (CNS), primary CNS lymphoma, tumor angiogenesis, spinal axis tumor, brain stem glioma, pituitary adenoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, epidermoid cancer, squamous cell cancer, T-cell lymphoma, environmentally induced cancers including those induced by asbestos, and combinations of said cancers. The present disclosure is also useful for treatment of metastatic cancers, especially metastatic cancers that express PD-L1 (Iwai et al. (2005) Int. Immunol. 17:133-144).
Optionally, the compounds of Formula (I) or salts thereof can be combined with another immunogenic agent, such as cancerous cells, purified tumor antigens (including recombinant proteins, peptides, and carbohydrate molecules), cells, and cells transfected with genes encoding immune stimulating cytokines (He et al (2004) J. Immunol. 173:4919-28). Non-limiting examples of tumor vaccines that can be used include peptides of melanoma antigens, such as peptides of gp100, MAGE antigens, Trp-2, MART1 and/or tyrosinase, or tumor cells transfected to express the cytokine GM-CSF. In humans, some tumors have been shown to be immunogenic such as melanomas. It is anticipated that by raising the threshold of T cell activation by PD-1 blockade, tumor responses are expected to be activated in the host.
The PD-1 blockade can be combined with a vaccination protocol. Many experimental strategies for vaccination against tumors have been devised (see Rosenberg, S., 2000, Development of Cancer Vaccines, ASCO Educational Book Spring: 60-62; Logothetis, C., 2000, ASCO Educational Book Spring: 300-302; Khayat, D. 2000, ASCO Educational Book Spring: 414-428; Foon, K. 2000, ASCO Educational Book Spring: 730-738; see also Restifo, N. and Sznol, M., Cancer Vaccines, Ch. 61, pp. 3023-3043 in DeVita, V. et al. (eds.), 1997, Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology. Fifth Edition). In one of these strategies, a vaccine is prepared using autologous or allogenenic tumor cells. These cellular vaccines have been shown to be most effective when the tumor cells are transduced to express GM-CSF. GM-CSF has been shown to be a potent activator of antigen presentation for tumor vaccination (Dranoff et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90: 3539-43).
The study of gene expression and large scale gene expression patterns in various tumors has led to the definition of so called tumor specific antigens (Rosenberg, S A (1999) Immunity 10: 281-7). In many cases, these tumor specific antigens are differentiation antigens expressed in the tumors and in the cell from which the tumor arose, for example melanocyte antigens gp100, MAGE antigens, and Trp-2. More importantly, many of these antigens can be shown to be the targets of tumor specific T cells found in the host. PD-1 blockade may be used in conjunction with a collection of recombinant proteins and/or peptides expressed in a tumor in order to generate an immune response to these proteins. These proteins are normally viewed by the immune system as self antigens and are therefore tolerant to them. The tumor antigen may also include the protein telomerase, which is required for the synthesis of telomeres of chromosomes and which is expressed in more than 85% of human cancers and in only a limited number of somatic tissues (Kim, N et al. (1994) Science 266: 2011-2013). (These somatic tissues may be protected from immune attack by various means). Tumor antigen may also be “neo-antigens” expressed in cancer cells because of somatic mutations that alter protein sequence or create fusion proteins between two unrelated sequences (i.e., bcr-abl in the Philadelphia chromosome), or idiotype from B cell tumors.
Other tumor vaccines may include the proteins from viruses implicated in human cancers such a Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV), Hepatitis Viruses (HBV and HCV) and Kaposi's Herpes Sarcoma Virus (KHSV). Another form of tumor specific antigen which may be used in conjunction with PD-1 blockade is purified heat shock proteins (HSP) isolated from the tumor tissue itself. These heat shock proteins contain fragments of proteins from the tumor cells and these HSPs are highly efficient at delivery to antigen presenting cells for eliciting tumor immunity (Suot, R & Srivastava, P (1995) Science 269:1585-1588; Tamura, Y. et al. (1997) Science 278:117-120).
Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen presenting cells that can be used to prime antigen-specific responses. DC's can be produced ex vivo and loaded with various protein and peptide antigens as well as tumor cell extracts (Nestle, F. et al. (1998) Nature Medicine 4: 328-332). DCs may also be transduced by genetic means to express these tumor antigens as well. DCs have also been fused directly to tumor cells for the purposes of immunization (Kugler, A. et al. (2000) Nature Medicine 6:332-336). As a method of vaccination, DC immunization may be effectively combined with PD-1 blockade to activate more potent anti-tumor responses.
PD-1 blockade may also be combined with standard cancer treatments. PD-1 blockade may be effectively combined with chemotherapeutic regimes. In these instances, it may be possible to reduce the dose of chemotherapeutic reagent administered (Mokyr, M. et al. (1998) Cancer Research 58: 5301-5304). An example of such a combination is a compound of this disclosure in combination with dacarbazine for the treatment of melanoma. Another example of such a combination is a compound of this disclosure in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for the treatment of melanoma. The scientific rationale behind the combined use of PD-1 blockade and chemotherapy is that cell death, that is a consequence of the cytotoxic action of most chemotherapeutic compounds, should result in increased levels of tumor antigen in the antigen presentation pathway. Other combination therapies that may result in synergy with PD-1 blockade through cell death are radiation, surgery, and hormone deprivation. Each of these protocols creates a source of tumor antigen in the host. Angiogenesis inhibitors may also be combined with PD-1 blockade. Inhibition of angiogenesis leads to tumor cell death which may feed tumor antigen into host antigen presentation pathways.
The compounds of this disclosure can also be used in combination with bispecific macrocyclic peptides that target Fc alpha or Fc gamma receptor-expressing effectors cells to tumor cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,922,845 and 5,837,243). Bispecific macrocyclic peptides can be used to target two separate antigens. For example anti-Fc receptor/anti tumor antigen (e.g., Her-2/neu) bispecific macrocyclic peptides have been used to target macrophages to sites of tumor. This targeting may more effectively activate tumor specific responses. The T cell arm of these responses would be augmented by the use of PD-1 blockade. Alternatively, antigen may be delivered directly to DCs by the use of bispecific macrocyclic peptides which bind to tumor antigen and a dendritic cell specific cell surface marker.
Tumors evade host immune surveillance by a large variety of mechanisms. Many of these mechanisms may be overcome by the inactivation of proteins which are expressed by the tumors and which are immunosuppressive. These include among others TGF-beta (Kehrl, J. et al. (1986) J. Exp. Med. 163: 1037-1050), IL-10 (Howard, M. & O'Garra, A. (1992) Immunology Today 13: 198-200), and Fas ligand (Hahne, M. et al. (1996) Science 274: 1363-1365). Macrocyclic peptides to each of these entities may be used in combination with the compounds of this disclosure to counteract the effects of the immunosuppressive agent and favor tumor immune responses by the host.
Macrocyclic peptides that activate host immune responsiveness can be used in combination with anti-PD-1. These include molecules on the surface of dendritic cells which activate DC function and antigen presentation. Anti-CD40 macrocyclic peptides are able to substitute effectively for T cell helper activity (Ridge, J. et al. (1998) Nature 393: 474-478) and can be used in conjunction with PD-1 macrocyclic peptides (Ito, N. et al. (2000) Immunobiology 201 (5) 527-40). Activating macrocyclic peptides to T cell costimulatory molecules such as CTLA-4 (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,097), OX-40 (Weinberg, A. et al. (2000) Immunol 164: 2160-2169), 4-1BB (Melero, I. et al. (1997) Nature Medicine 3: 682-685 (1997), and ICOS (Hutloff, A. et al. (1999) Nature 397: 262-266) may also provide for increased levels of T cell activation.
Bone marrow transplantation is currently being used to treat a variety of tumors of hematopoietic origin. While graft versus host disease is a consequence of this treatment, therapeutic benefit may be obtained from graft vs. tumor responses. PD-1 blockade can be used to increase the effectiveness of the donor engrafted tumor specific T cells. Other methods of the disclosure are used to treat patients who have been exposed to particular toxins or pathogens. Accordingly, another aspect of the disclosure provides a method of treating an infectious disease in a subject comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or salts thereof. Similar to its application to tumors as discussed above, the compound of Formula (I) or salts thereof can be used alone, or as an adjuvant, in combination with vaccines, to stimulate the immune response to pathogens, toxins, and self-antigens. Examples of pathogens for which this therapeutic approach may be particularly useful, include pathogens for which there is currently no effective vaccine, or pathogens for which conventional vaccines are less than completely effective. These include, but are not limited to HIV, Hepatitis (A, B, & C), Influenza, Herpes, Giardia, Malaria, Leishmania, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. PD-1 blockade is particularly useful against established infections by agents such as HIV that present altered antigens over the course of the infections. These novel epitopes are recognized as foreign at the time of administration, thus provoking a strong T cell response that is not dampened by negative signals through PD-1.
Some examples of pathogenic viruses causing infections treatable by methods of the disclosure include HIV, hepatitis (A, B, or C), herpes virus (e.g., VZV, HSV-1, HAV-6, HSV-II, and CMV, Epstein Barr virus), adenovirus, influenza virus, flaviviruses, echovirus, rhinovirus, coxsackie virus, cornovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, mumps virus, rotavirus, measles virus, rubella virus, parvovirus, vaccinia virus, HTLV virus, dengue virus, papillomavirus, molluscum virus, poliovirus, rabies virus, JC virus and arboviral encephalitis virus.
Some examples of pathogenic bacteria causing infections treatable by methods of the disclosure include chlamydia, rickettsial bacteria, mycobacteria, staphylococci, streptococci, pneumonococci, meningococci and conococci, klebsiella, proteus, serratia, pseudomonas, legionella, diphtheria, salmonella, bacilli, cholera, tetanus, botulism, anthrax, plague, leptospirosis, and Lyme's disease bacteria.
Some examples of pathogenic fungi causing infections treatable by methods of the disclosure include Candida (albicans, krusei, glabrata, tropicalis, etc.), Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus (fumigatus, niger, etc.), Genus Mucorales (mucor, absidia, rhizophus), Sporothrix schenkii, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Coccidioides immitis and Histoplasma capsulatum.
Some examples of pathogenic parasites causing infections treatable by methods of the disclosure include Entamoeba histolytica, Balantidium coli, Naegleria fowleri, Acanthamoeba sp., Giardia lambia, Cryptosporidium sp., Pneumocystis carinii, Plasmodium vivax, Babesia microti, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania donovani, Toxoplasma gondi, and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. In all of the above methods, PD-1 blockade can be combined with other forms of immunotherapy such as cytokine treatment (e.g., interferons, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-2), or bispecific antibody therapy, which provides for enhanced presentation of tumor antigens (see, e.g., Holliger (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak (1994) Structure 2:1121-1123).
The compounds of this disclosure may provoke and amplify autoimmune responses. Indeed, induction of anti-tumor responses using tumor cell and peptide vaccines reveals that many anti-tumor responses involve anti-self reactivities (depigmentation observed in anti-CTLA-4+GM-CSF-modified B 16 melanoma in van Elsas et al. supra; depigmentation in Trp-2 vaccinated mice (Overwijk, W. et al. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 96: 2982-2987); autoimmune prostatitis evoked by TRAMP tumor cell vaccines (Hurwitz, A. (2000) supra), melanoma peptide antigen vaccination and vitiligo observed in human clinical trials (Rosenberg, S A and White, D E (1996) J. Immunother Emphasis Tumor Immunol 19 (1): 81-4).
Therefore, it is possible to consider using anti-PD-1 blockade in conjunction with various self proteins in order to devise vaccination protocols to efficiently generate immune responses against these self proteins for disease treatment. For example, Alzheimer's disease involves inappropriate accumulation of A.beta. peptide in amyloid deposits in the brain; antibody responses against amyloid are able to clear these amyloid deposits (Schenk et al., (1999) Nature 400: 173-177).
Other self proteins may also be used as targets such as IgE for the treatment of allergy and asthma, and TNF.alpha. for rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, antibody responses to various hormones may be induced by the use of a compound of Formula (I) or salts thereof. Neutralizing antibody responses to reproductive hormones may be used for contraception. Neutralizing antibody response to hormones and other soluble factors that are required for the growth of particular tumors may also be considered as possible vaccination targets.
Analogous methods as described above for the use of anti-PD-1 antibody can be used for induction of therapeutic autoimmune responses to treat patients having an inappropriate accumulation of other self-antigens, such as amyloid deposits, including A.beta. in Alzheimer's disease, cytokines such as TNF.alpha., and IgE. The compounds of this disclosure may be used to stimulate antigen-specific immune responses by coadministration of a compound of Formula (I) or salts thereof with an antigen of interest (e.g., a vaccine). Accordingly, in another aspect the disclosure provides a method of enhancing an immune response to an antigen in a subject, comprising administering to the subject: (i) the antigen; and (ii) a compound of Formula (I) or salts thereof, such that an immune response to the antigen in the subject is enhanced. The antigen can be, for example, a tumor antigen, a viral antigen, a bacterial antigen or an antigen from a pathogen. Non-limiting examples of such antigens include those discussed in the sections above, such as the tumor antigens (or tumor vaccines) discussed above, or antigens from the viruses, bacteria or other pathogens described above.
As previously described, the compounds of the disclosure can be co-administered with one or more other therapeutic agents, e.g., a cytotoxic agent, a radiotoxic agent or an immunosuppressive agent. The compounds of the disclosure can be administered before, after or concurrently with the other therapeutic agent or can be co-administered with other known therapies, e.g., an anti-cancer therapy, e.g., radiation. Such therapeutic agents include, among others, anti-neoplastic agents such as doxorubicin (adriamycin), cisplatin bleomycin sulfate, carmustine, chlorambucil, decarbazine and cyclophosphamide hydroxyurea which, by themselves, are only effective at levels which are toxic or subtoxic to a patient. Cisplatin is intravenously administered as a 100 mg/dose once every four weeks and adriamycin is intravenously administered as a 60-75 mg/ml dose once every 21 days. Co-administration of a compound of Formula (I) or salts thereof, with chemotherapeutic agents provides two anti-cancer agents which operate via different mechanisms which yield a cytotoxic effect to human tumor cells. Such co-administration can solve problems due to development of resistance to drugs or a change in the antigenicity of the tumor cells which would render them unreactive with the antibody.
Also within the scope of the present disclosure are kits comprising a compound of Formula (I) or salts thereof and instructions for use. The kit can further contain at least one additional reagent. Kits typically include a label indicating the intended use of the contents of the kit. The term label includes any writing, or recorded material supplied on or with the kit, or which otherwise accompanies the kit.
The above other therapeutic agents, when employed in combination with the compounds of the present disclosure, may be used, for example, in those amounts indicated in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) or as otherwise determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. In the methods of the present disclosure, such other therapeutic agent(s) may be administered prior to, simultaneously with, or following the administration of the inventive compounds.
In one embodiment, the compounds of Formula (I) inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction with IC50 values of 10 μM or less, for example, from 0.01 to 10 μM, as measured by the PD-1/PD-L1 Homogenous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) binding assay. Preferably, the compounds of Formula (I) inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction with IC50 values of 1 μM or less, for example, from 0.01 to 1 μM.

Biological Assay
The ability of the compounds of Formula (I) to bind to PD-L1 was investigated using a PD-1/PD-L1 Homogenous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) binding assay.
Homogenous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) Binding Assay.
All binding studies were performed in an HTRF assay buffer consisting of dPBS supplemented with 0.1% (withv) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20. For the PD-1-Ig/PD-L1-His binding assay, inhibitors were pre-incubated with PD-L1-His (10 nM final) for 15 m in 4 μl of assay buffer, followed by addition of PD-1-Ig (20 nM final) in 1 μl of assay buffer and further incubation for 15 m. PD-L1 from either human, cyno, or mouse were used. HTRF detection was achieved using europium crypate-labeled anti-Ig (1 nM final) and allophycocyanin (APC) labeled anti-His (20 nM final). Antibodies were diluted in HTRF detection buffer and 5 μl was dispensed on top of binding reaction. The reaction mixture was allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes and signal (665 nm/620 nm ratio) was obtained using an EnVision fluorometer. Additional binding assays were established between PD-1-Ig/PD-L2-His (20 & 5 nM, respectively), CD80-His/PD-L1-Ig (100 & 10 nM, respectively) and CD80-His/CTLA4-Ig (10 & 5 nM, respectively). Competition studies between biotinylated SEQ ID NO:71 and human PD-L1-His were performed as follows. Inhibitors were pre-incubated with PD-L1-His (10 nM final) for 60 m in 4 μl of assay buffer followed by addition of biotinylated SEQ ID NO:71 (0.5 nM final) in 1 μl of assay buffer. Binding was allowed to equilibrate for 30 m followed by addition of europium crypated labeled Strepatavidin (2.5 pM final) and APC-labeled anti-His (20 nM final) in 5 μl of HTRF buffer. The reaction was allowed to equilibrate for 30 m and signal (665 nm/620 nm ratio) was obtained using an EnVision fluorometer. The table below lists the IC50 values for Examples 1-108 of this disclosure measured in the PD-1/PD-L1 Homogenous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) binding assay. The compounds of the present disclosure, as exemplified by Examples 1-297, showed IC50 values in the following ranges: A=0.006-0.10 μM; B=0.11-1.00 μM; C=1.01-10 μM.
