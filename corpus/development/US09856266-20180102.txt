FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates to IRE-1α inhibitors and their therapeutic uses.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Protein folding stress in the endoplasmic reticulum of a cell initiates a signal transduction cascade termed the unfolded protein response or UPR. A key enzyme, inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1α), relieves protein folding stress by enhancing molecular chaperone activity and therefore protects cells from stress induced apoptosis. Inhibitors of IRE-1α are useful for treating at least B cell autoimmune diseases, certain cancers, and some viral infections.

Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts; Stereoisomers; Tautomers
IRE-1α inhibitor compounds include both the free form of the compounds and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and stereoisomers thereof. Some of the specific IRE-1α inhibitor compounds described herein are the protonated salts of amine compounds. The term “free form” refers to the amine compounds in non-salt form. The encompassed pharmaceutically acceptable salts not only include the salts described for the specific compounds disclosed herein, but also all the typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the free form of IRE-1α inhibitor compounds of the invention and prodrugs thereof.
The free form of the specific salt compounds described may be isolated using techniques known in the art. For example, the free form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free forms may differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid and base salts are otherwise pharmaceutically equivalent to their respective free forms for purposes of the invention.
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the disclosed IRE-1α inhibitor compounds can be synthesized from the compounds of this invention which contain a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, the salts of the basic compounds are prepared either by ion exchange chromatography or by reacting the free base with stoichiometric amounts or with an excess of the desired salt-forming inorganic or organic acid in a suitable solvent or various combinations of solvents. Similarly, the salts of the acidic compounds are formed by reactions with the appropriate inorganic or organic base.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of IRE-1α inhibitor compounds include the conventional non-toxic salts of the compounds as formed by reacting a basic compound with an inorganic or organic acid. For example, conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like, as well as salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxy-benzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, trifluoroacetic and the like.
When an IRE-1α inhibitor compound is acidic, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include salts prepared form pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Particular salts are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine caffeine, choline, N,N1-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. The preparation of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts described above and other typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts is more fully described by Berg et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts,” J. Pharm. Sci., 1977:66:1-19.
Some IRE-1α compounds or prodrugs are potentially internal salts or zwitterions, because under physiological conditions a deprotonated acidic moiety in the compound, such as a carboxyl group, may be anionic, and this electronic charge might then be balanced off internally against the cationic charge of a protonated or alkylated basic moiety, such as a quaternary nitrogen atom.
IRE-1α inhibitor compounds or prodrugs thereof may have asymmetric centers, chiral axes, and chiral planes (as described in: E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen, Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1994, pages 1119-1190), and may occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, and as individual diastereomers, with all possible isomers and mixtures thereof, including optical isomers, being included in the present invention.
An IRE-1α inhibitor compound or prodrug thereof may be of such a nature that its constituent atoms are capable of being arranged spatially in two or more ways, despite having identical bonds. As a consequence, this compound exists in the form of stereoisomers. Cis/trans isomerism is only one type of stereoisomerism. If the stereoisomers are image and mirror image which cannot be superimposed, they are enantiomers which have chirality or handedness since one or more asymmetric carbon atoms are present in the structure forming them. Enantiomers are optically active and therefore distinguishable since they rotate the plane of polarized light to an equal extent, but in opposite directions.
If two or more asymmetric carbon atoms are present in an IRE-1α compound, two possible configurations exist at each of these carbon atoms. If two asymmetric carbon atoms are present, four possible stereoisomers exist, for example. Furthermore, these four possible stereoisomers can be divided into six possible pairs of stereoisomers that differ from each other. In order for a pair of molecules with more than one asymmetric carbon to be enantiomers, they must have different configurations at each asymmetric carbon. Those pairs that do not behave as enantiomers have a different stereochemical relationship, which is known as a diastereomeric relationship. Stereoisomers that are not enantiomers are known as diastereoisomers, or, more frequently, diastereomers.
All of these well-known aspects of the stereochemistry of the compounds of the invention are considered to be part of the present invention. The present invention therefore covers IRE-1α inhibitor compounds which are stereoisomers, and, if these are enantiomers, the individual enantiomers, racemic mixtures of these enantiomers, and artificial, i.e. synthetic, mixtures comprising proportions of these enantiomers which are different from the proportions of these enantiomers observed in a racemic mixture. If an IRE-1α inhibitor compound has stereoisomers that are diastereomers, this compound includes the individual diastereomers as well as mixtures of any two or more of these diastereomers in any desired proportions.
The following is intended to serve for explanation: if a single asymmetric carbon atom exists in an IRE-1α inhibitor compound that results in the (−)(R) and (+)(S) enantiomers thereof, this an IRE-1α inhibitor compound includes all pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms, prodrugs and metabolites thereof which are therapeutically active and useful for the treatment of or preventing the diseases and conditions described further herein. If an IRE-1α inhibitor compound exists in the form of (−)(R) and (+)(S) enantiomers, this compound also includes the (+)(S) enantiomer alone or the (−)(R) enantiomer alone if all, substantially all or a predominant share of the therapeutic activity resides in only one of these enantiomers or undesired side effects reside in only one of these enantiomers. If essentially no difference exists between the biological properties of the two enantiomers, this compound of the invention furthermore includes the (+)(S) enantiomer and the (−)(R) enantiomer together as a racemic mixture or non-racemic mixture in any desired ratio of corresponding proportions.
The specific biological effects and/or physical and chemical properties of a pair or set of enantiomers of an IRE-1α inhibitor compound—if present—may make it obvious to use these enantiomers in certain ratios, for example to form a final therapeutic product. The following is intended to serve for illustration: if a pair of enantiomers exists, the enantiomers can be used in ratios such as 90% (R)-10% (S), 80% (R)-20% (S), 70% (R)-30% (S), 60% (R)-40% (S), 50% (R)-50% (S), 40% (R)-60% (S), 30% (R)-70% (S), 20% (R)-80% (S), and 10% (R)-90% (S). After evaluation of the properties of the various enantiomers of an IRE-1α inhibitor compound—if they exist—the corresponding amount of one or more of these enantiomers having certain desired properties which form the final therapeutic product can be determined in a simple manner.
For IRE-1α inhibitor compounds disclosed herein which may exist as tautomers, both tautomeric forms are encompassed within the invention, even though only one tautomeric structure is depicted. For example, a compound such as that below drawn as the keto tautomer includes the enol tautomer, and vice versa, as well as mixtures thereof
The invention also includes pharmaceutically usable stereoisomers, E/Z isomers, enantiomers, racemates, diastereomers, hydrates, and solvates of the disclosed compounds. “Solvates” are adductions of inert solvent molecules onto the compounds which form owing to their mutual attractive force. Solvates are, for example, monohydrates, dihydrates or alcoholates.
Prodrugs
The invention also provides prodrugs which are metabolized to active IRE-1α inhibitor compounds after administration. For example, IRE-1α inhibitor compounds disclosed herein can be modified, for example, with alkyl or acyl groups, sugars, or oligopeptides and which are rapidly cleaved in vivo to release the active IRE-1α inhibitor compounds.
Derivatives of the corresponding aromatic alcohols can serve as prodrugs for aromatic aldehydes because alcohols and aldehydes are metabolically interconvertible, according to the following general scheme:

Therapeutic Methods

Disorders Associated with UPR
A fine balance exists between a cell's life and death depending on how protein folding stress is managed by the cell (proteostasis). Imbalances in proteostasis lead to many metabolic, oncological, neurodegenerative, inflammatory, cardiovascular disorders and infectious disease (Balch et al., Science 319, 916, 2008). The UPR relates specifically to the proteostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum where all secreted and membrane proteins are translated, folded and processed for delivery to their individual site of action. Therefore, activation of the UPR enhances protein folding in the ER allowing the cell to survive. If protein folding stress is not managed in the ER, the cells will initiate apoptosis.
Protein folding stress may be a natural hallmark of the type of cell for example insulin secreting β-islet cells or antibody secreting plasma cells. In both cases, the cell has fine tuned the machinery to deal with the stress by activating the UPR. Depending on the disease type, it may be therapeutically beneficial to induce or inhibit the UPR. For example, in type II diabetes or Alzheimer's disease, it may be therapeutically beneficial to activate the UPR in such a way where β-islet cells survive the stress of over producing insulin or neurons survive the apoptotic effects due to unfolded aggregates of β-amyloid protein. Diseases such as cancer, inflammation, and viral infection may be therapeutically modulated by inhibition of the UPR. In these types of conditions, cellular survival due to corruption of the UPR may be impacted. Protein folding in the ER is negatively impacted by such conditions in the tumor microenvironment as hypoxia, glucose starvation, amino acid deprivation, acidosis and mutant malfolded and oncogenic proteins. Additionally chemo-, bio-, and radiotherapy can lead to protein folding stress. It may be possible to induce apoptosis in these conditions by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic effects of the UPR. Myeloma derived from neoplastic antibody secreting plasma cells provides an example of a condition in which this approach can be applied.
Lastly, enveloped viruses must use and corrupt this system to ensure production of progeny from infected cells. Viruses often produce vast quantities of viral membrane glycoproteins which are folded and modified in the ER. Therefore, activation of the UPR by the virus for this purpose as a survival mechanism is entirely conceivable. It is therefore logical that inhibition of the UPR during viral infection can impact the outcome of the disease in a beneficial way.
Only specialized secretory cells and diseased cells activate the UPR for their own benefit. Most cells are not under such protein folding stress and therefore would not be impacted by a UPR inhibitor. Thus, “disorders associated with the UPR” as used herein means conditions for which pathogenesis can be advantageously impacted by inhibition of the UPR. In various embodiments of the invention such inhibition of the UPR is accomplished through inhibition of IRE-1α.
In some embodiments the IRE-1α inhibitor compounds or prodrugs thereof are useful to treat or ameliorate a symptom of a B cell autoimmune disease, certain cancers, and infections of enveloped viruses that use the endoplasmic reticulum as a viral factory for expressing viral surface and spike proteins for budding and infection. IRE-1α inhibitors and prodrugs thereof can be used as single agents or in combination therapies, as described below.
B cell autoimmune diseases which can be treated include, but are not limited to, Addison's disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, aplastic anemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemias, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune hypophysitis, autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorders, autoimmune myocarditis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, giant cell arteritis, Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, IgA nephropathy, myasthenia gravis, pemphigus foliaceous, pemphigus vulgaris, polyarteritis nodosa, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, Takayasu's arteritis, and Wegener's granulomatosis.
Cancers which can be treated include solid tumors, such as tumors of the breast, bone, prostate, lung, adrenal gland (e.g., adrenocortical tumors), bile duct, bladder, bronchus, nervous tissue (including neuronal and glial tumors), gall bladder, stomach, salivary gland, esophagus, small intestine, cervix, colon, rectum, liver, ovary, pancreas, pituitary adenomas, and secretory adenomas. Methods of the invention are particularly useful for treating drug- or radiation-resistant solid tumors.
Cancers of the blood (e.g., lymphomas and leukemias) also can be treated including, but not limited to, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (e.g., cutaneous T cell lymphomas such as Sezary syndrome and Mycosis fungoides, diffuse large cell lymphoma, HTLV-1 associated T cell lymphoma, nodal peripheral T cell lymphoma, extranodal peripheral T cell lymphoma, central nervous system lymphoma, and AIDS-related lymphoma). Leukemias include acute and chronic types of both lymphocytic and myelogenous leukemia (e.g, acute lymphocytic or lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, T cell prolymphocytic leukemia, adult T cell leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia). Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), the precursor of myeloma, also can be treated.
Viral infections which can be treated include infections of enveloped viruses which use the unfolded protein response pathway when they replicate and form infectious progeny (e.g., measles, pox viruses, Ebola, etc.). Infections also include those of Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Flaviviruses (e.g., Japanese Encephalitis Virus and West Nile Virus), and Hepatitis C virus (HCV).
Combination Therapies
Various types of physiological stress induce the unfolded protein response including, but not limited to, hypoxia, nutrient starvation, acidosis, and genetic damage resulting in mutant or over-expressed misfolded proteins (oncogenic stress). One or more of these conditions are manifest in cancer cells, which may in part be mediated by the microenviroment of the tumor. It is likely the cytoprotective arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) plays an anti-apoptotic role in tumor survival. In addition, bio- and chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation treatments may further impact the protein folding and degradation cycle in the ER thereby inducing the UPR as a protective resistance mechanism. Patients succumb to cancer because either the tumor is resistant to conventional therapies or returns in a resistant form after an initial response to treatment and, therefore, new treatments and treatment combinations are needed.
Angiogenesis inhibitors block tumor growth by inhibiting new blood vessel formation, a process that would enhance the stress effects of the tumor microenvironment. A promising approach to further reduce tumor burden would be to administer anti-angiogenesis agents in combination with IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitors to obtain a similar effect as that demonstrated by RNAi knockdown of GRP78, the major chaperone of the ER and target of XBP-1s (Dong et al., Cancer Res. 2007 Jul. 15; 67(2):6700-7). In addition, IRE-1α itself regulates angiogenesis by influencing the expression of VEGF.
Proteasome inhibitors and Hsp90 inhibitors are thought to act in part by blocking protein degradation and folding, respectively, inducing apoptosis (Davenport et al., Blood 2007 Oct. 1; 110(7):2641-9). Although it is clear that Hsp90 inhibitors induce XBP-1 splicing and activation of the UPR, it is less clear that proteasome inhibitors activate IRE-1α. Current scientific literature suggest that IRE-1α is not or is only minimally activated by proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib or MG-132 (Davenport et al., Blood 2007 Oct. 1; 110(7):2641-9).
Interference with UPR may sensitize cancer cells to various chemotherapeutics that elevate the cellular stress. Combination therapies which include IRE-1α inhibitors may become important therapies in conjunction with current and future standard of care in cancer.
Although the level of activation IRE-1α in solid tumors is currently not known, clearly, induction of the UPR in patient biopsies of drug resistant tumors is evidenced by induction of GRP78 (Moenner et al., Cancer Res. 2007 Nov. 15; 67(22):10631-4; Lee, Cancer Res. 2007 Apr. 15; 67(6e):3496-9).
Inhibition of XBP-1 splicing may have a greater effect than anticipated as the un-spliced form of XBP-1 may act as a dominant negative to XBP-1 and ATF-6 transcriptional activity. Further inhibitors which block the RNAse activity but not kinase activity of IRE-1α may have the added benefit of signaling through the JNK pathway, a signal that can have pro-apoptotic consequences.
In some embodiments an IRE-1α inhibitor compound or prodrug thereof is administered in combination with a therapeutic agent that induces or up-regulates IRE-1α expression (e.g., Hsp90 and or HDAC inhibitors, both of which induce IRE-1α activation and XBP-1 splicing) or a therapeutic agent which is less effective when IRE-1α is expressed (e.g., 17-AAG (TANESPIMYCIN® and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)).
In some embodiments an IRE-1α inhibitor compound or prodrug thereof is administered in combination with a cancer therapeutic agent, for example radiation therapy or a cancer therapeutic agent (e.g., a chemotherapeutic agent or a biotherapeutic agent) as described below. The cancer therapeutic agent can be administered separately or together with the IRE-1α inhibitor compound. The cancer therapeutic agent can be administered at essentially the same time as the IRE-1α inhibitor compound or can be administered either before or after the IRE-1α inhibitor compound.

Routes of Administration
Pharmaceutical preparations of the invention can be administered locally or systemically. Suitable routes of administration include oral, pulmonary, rectal, transmucosal, intestinal, parenteral (including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary routes), intranodal, intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, intraocular, transdermal, topical, and vaginal routes. As described in more detail above, dosage forms include, but are not limited to, tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, suppositories, solutions, capsules, creams, patches, minipumps and the like. Targeted delivery systems also can be used (for example, a liposome coated with target-specific antibody).
Dosage
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises at least one active ingredient (an IRE-1α inhibitor compound or prodrug thereof) in a therapeutically effective dose. A “therapeutically effective dose” is the amount of an IRE-1α inhibitor compound or prodrug thereof which, when administered to a patient over a treatment period, results in a measurable improvement in a characteristic of the disease being treated (e.g., improved laboratory values, retarded development of a symptom, reduced severity of a symptom, or improved levels of an appropriate biological marker).
Determination of therapeutically effective doses is well within the capability of those skilled in the art. A therapeutically effective dose initially can be estimated from in vitro enzyme assays, cell culture assays, and/or animal models. For example, a dose can be formulated in an animal model to achieve a circulating concentration range at least as concentrated as the IC50 as determined in an in vitro enzyme assay or in a cell culture (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of IRE-1α activity). Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. See the FDA guidance document “Guidance for Industry and Reviewers Estimating the Safe Starting Dose in Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers” (HFA-305), which provides an equation for use in calculating a human equivalent dose (HED) based on in vivo animal studies.

LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures and/or experimental animals. Data obtained from cell culture assays or animal studies can be used to determine initial human doses. As is known in the art, the dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form and route of administration used.
Usual dosages for systemic administration to a human patient range from 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg (e.g., 1-10 μg/kg, 20-80 μg/kg, 5-50 μg/kg, 75-150 μg/kg, 100-500 μg/kg, 250-750 μg/kg, 500-1000 μg/kg, 1-10 mg/kg, 5-50 mg/kg, 25-75 mg/kg, 50-100 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg). In some embodiments, the treatment schedule can require that a plasma concentration of an IRE-1α inhibitor compound be maintained for a period of time (e.g., several days or a week) and then allowed to decay by ceasing administration for a period of time (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks). The amount of composition administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the disorder, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician.

IRE-1α Assay
A fusion protein comprising glutathione S transferase (GST) and human IRE-1α (GST-IRE-1α) obtained from a 500 ml baculovirus-infected insect cell culture can be used to measure IRE-1α activity in vitro.
Five μl of a reaction mixture comprising 1× reaction buffer (5× reaction buffer is 100 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 250 mM KOAc, 2.5 mM MgCl2), 3 mM DTT, and 0.4% polyethylene glycol water is added to each well of 384 well plates. Twenty-five nanoliters of a 1 mM test compound solution are added to test wells. Three μl of a 128 ng/ml IRE-1α preparation are added to each test well and to positive control wells (final concentration 5.82 ng/well). Negative control wells contain only reaction mixture and test compound.
After spinning the plates at 1200 rpm for 30 seconds, 3 μl of an IRE-1α human mini-XBP-1 mRNA stem-loop substrate 5′-CAGUCCGCAGCACUG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:1), labeled with the fluorescent dye Cy5 at the 5′ end and Black Hole Quencher 2 (BH2) at the 3′ end, are added to each well of a control plate. The plates are again spun at 1200 rpm for 30 seconds. Final concentrations for the assay are: 63 nM IRE-1α substrate, 5.82 ng IRE-1α protein, and 2.5 μM test compound.
The plates are covered with lids and incubated for one hour at 30° C. The plates are then transferred to an ACQUEST™ microplate reader. Data is analyzed using data analysis software, and the percent activity of IRE-1α is calculated.
Example 22
Determination of IC50 for Inhibition of IRE-1α
IC50 for inhibition of IRE-1α of compounds identified in Table 1 was measured as described in Example 21.
Example 23
Kinase Selectivity Assays
Compounds of the invention are assayed for their ability to inhibit 86 different kinases at a concentration of 10 μM. The results of the assays demonstrate that these compounds are selective for IRE-1α.
Example 24
Cell-Based Assays
Human myeloma MM.1s cells are incubated with a compound of the invention for 1.25 hours before stressing the cells with 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). After an additional 45 minutes (2 hours total) with compound and DTT, the cells are harvested with TRIZOL® (a mono-phasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate), and total RNA is prepared as directed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Human XBP-1 is amplified by RT-PCR with the following primers, which flank the 26 base unconventional intron excised by IRE-1α:  (forward)
(SEQ ID NO: 2)
CCTGGTTGCTGAAGAGGAGG
and
(reverse)
(SEQ ID NO: 3)
CCATGGGGAGATGTTCTGGAG.
In unstressed cells, IRE-1α is inactive and hence, the 26 base intron is left in the XBP-1 mRNA. RT-PCR of unstressed (U) cells then generates the upper band. When cells are stressed (S) with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressing agent DTT, IRE-1α is activated due to accumulating unfolded protein and the resulting RT-PCR product is 26 base pairs shorter. Increasing amounts of the compound block IRE-1α-mediated XBP-1 splicing as demonstrated by a shift from a lower band to an upper band. Compound potency reflects SAR in the in vitro enzyme assay.
Determination of Cellular ED50 for IRE-1α Inhibitors
Compounds which pass specificity assays are assayed for cellular EC50 using endogenous XBP-1 splicing in myeloma cells. XBP-1 is regulated through the excision of a 26 nucleotide intron from the XBP-1 mRNA by the highly specific endoribonuclease activity of IRE-1α. This splicing event induces a frame shift in the ORF of the C-terminus of XBP-1 leading to the translation of the larger 54 kD active transcription factor rather than the inactive 33 kD form. This splicing event is used to measure IRE-1α activity on XBP-1 mRNA in cells and tissues.
Briefly, compounds are incubated in the presence or absence of an ER stress agent (e.g., DTT), and the ratio of XBP-1u (unspliced) to XBP-1s (spliced) is quantified by RT-PCR. The ED50 is determined as the 50% XBP-1s to total XPB-1 levels. Compounds which have EC50s equal to or below 10 μM are used in standard apoptosis assays, including Annexin V staining and CASPASE-GLO®.
Proliferation assays using myeloma cell lines (U266, RPMI8226 and MM.1s) are used to determine ED50. Compounds are used as single agents and in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs. IRE-1α inhibitor compounds inhibit the proliferation of RPMI8226 myeloma cells, which have endogenous activation of the pathway and are further induced by the addition of bortezomib. When an IRE-1α inhibitor compound is used in combination with MG-132, increased apoptosis is observed with U266 myeloma cells.
Example 25
Animal Model/Preclinical Validation Studies
The preclinical validation strategy employs a set of animal models representing normal tissues under chemical stress and multiple myeloma xenographs. The normal animal model is employed as a surrogate model where dose-related on-target activity of compounds can be confirmed in tissues sensitive to standard UPR inducing agents such as tunicamycin (Wu et al., Dev Cell. 2007 September; 13(1d):351-64). Normal mouse tissues are not under ER stress, and therefore the XBP-1 mRNA remains as the inactive, unspliced form. Upon induction with tunicamycin, tissues induce active XBP-1 mRNA splicing, and this activity is suppressed by IRE-1α inhibitors. This on-target ER stress animal model is a useful screening and early pharmacokinetic tool.
Antibody production is evaluated in a second surrogate model. However, in cell-based models, IRE-1α inhibitors have been shown to potently inhibit antibody production.
Final efficacy studies are performed in myeloma xenograft models, as described below.
Example 26
RPMI8226 Xenograft Efficacy Model
SCID mice are evaluated for their ability to support implantation of desired tumor cells in support of model development and characterization. Mice are injected intravenously (5) or implanted either subcutaneously (SC) or intraperitoneally (IP). To generate a relevant animal model mimicking human disease, it is desirable that all three approaches are evaluated for improved implantation rates and relevant disease progression, as is well known in the art. SC injections provide an easy way to measure tumor growth and efficacy, and IV and IP injections represent a more physiologically relevant model of human tumor spread. SC injections are given primarily in the flank, while IV injections are administered in the tail vein. Mice are manually restrained for SC and IP injections, and a Broome mouse restrainer is used for IV injections.
Example 27
Evaluation of IRE-1α Inhibitor Compounds in a Xenograft Efficacy Model
SCID mice are implanted with tumor cells (human RPMI8226 myeloma cells) via IP, IV or SC routes based on the results from the xenograft model development studies (above). Mice are treated with compound or mock treated (vehicle) for a period of up to 4-5 weeks. Compound administration can be via IV, IP, PO or SC routes. In some cases, tunicamycin is administered via IP injection in order to stimulate stress in the animal. This stress mimics the stress an animal may undergo during times of tumor growth. The tunicaymycin injection mimics tumor growth during times of stress and permits evaluation of biomarkers which indicate the effectiveness of a compound (such as XBP-1 splicing) by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, or Western blots.
Mice are monitored for tumor growth, regression and general health. Tumors are collected and characterized by immunohistochemistry and/or FACS analysis. Tumor growth is measured by calipers, ultrasound, or by abdominal lavage. Biomarkers in the blood or tumor can evaluated (primarily XBP-1 splicing).
In some experiments, blood samples are collected at various time points during the dosing (i.e., day 1 or week 4 etc.) to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile. The time points of blood collection vary depending on the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug being tested. The volume of blood sample is 100 microliters/per time point, and mice are bled twice after drug administration within a 24 hour period via retro-orbital sinus. If the same mouse is used, blood samples are collected once from each eye during 24 hours.
Tumor cells are cultured and injected IP, IV (tail vein) or SC (flank) in the mouse using a 21 G needle in a volume of approx 100 μL. Mice are treated with compounds or vehicle alone as a control by IV, IP, SC or PO routes 5 days per week for up to 4-5 weeks. Blood is collected via retroorbital bleed (100 μl) at 2 time points (different eyes). The endpoint of the study depends on the overall health of the mice: while mice are euthanized at the end of 4-5 weeks in most studies, mice are maintained until day 40 in a few studies if their general health will allow. The reason for maintaining studies for 40 days is to determine if the tested compounds have a long term effect on inhibiting tumor growth. Euthanization of mice in which tumor regression is observed will depend on the experimental design. In screening mode, the experiment will end with tumors in the control/untreated group reach 1.5 cm, are ulcerated or when loss of motility is observed in that group. In follow up experiments, mice in which tumor regression is observed may be maintained longer, until they show signs of tumor growth of ill health.
Therapeutic dosing with bortezomib 0.75 mg/kg IV twice weekly of SCID mice bearing human myeloma RPMI8226 tumor xenografts resulted in suppression of tumor growth. However, after cessation of bortezomib therapy, tumors often recurred and grew into large masses. Therefore, mice will be treated in combination as with both bortezomib (as indicated) and twice daily with 10-60 mg/kg IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitors such as compound 17-1 by oral, IP or TV administration. Compounds which reduce the incidence of tumor recurrence are identified.
Example 28
Combination Therapies
The spliced form of XBP-1, as a homodimer and heterodimer with ATF-6, transcriptionally regulates genes involved in adapting to ER stress (Wu et al., Dev Cell. 2007 September; 13(1d):351-64). Many of these downstream targets are major chaperones, co-chaperones and ERAD components of the ER. Chaperones such as GRP78 and GRP94 are stable and long lived proteins with half lives on the order of days (Wu et al., Dev Cell. 2007 September; 13(1d):351-64). Therefore, treatment of cancer with an IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitor may require up to 5 to 6 days of treatment in each cycle.
In some embodiments, combination therapy given in cycles such as with proteasome inhibitors involves giving the patient 2 days of pretreatment with IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitor and then simultaneously with the chemotherapeutic agent until a pharmacodynamic effect is achieved (typically 24 hours post bortezomib infusion). Bortezomib is typically administered on three week cycles, every 1, 4, 8 and 11 days (of 21). Dosing is 1.3 mg/m2 by IV administration. IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitors can be administered 2 day prior and 24 hours post infusion of bortezomib at 10 to 100 mg/kg by the IV or oral route once, twice or three times daily depending on the PK/PD relationship.
A similar protocol can be employed with Hsp90 and or HDAC inhibitors. Alternatively, both agents are administered simultaneously for the duration of each cycle depending on the PK/PD relation of the inhibitor. IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitors can be given to breast cancer patients in combination with Tamoxifen (Gomez et al., FASEB J. 2007 December; 21(2):4013-27) or in combination with Sorafinib to various other cancers including kidney carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (Rahmani et al., Mol Cell Biol. 2007 August; 27(15):5499-513).
In general, because many kinase inhibitors often are not selective on their targeted kinase and often affect many additional kinases; they may cause non-specific cellular stress which may activate the UPR. Therefore, combination approaches may be useful using IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitors as sensitizing agents.

Compound no. 12-4 was administered orally two hours later at one of three doses: 100 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, or 25 mg/kg (2 hour exposure) in 10% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD). The total exposure to tunicamycin was 4 hours, and the total exposure to compound 12-4 was 2 hours. See FIG. 1A .
