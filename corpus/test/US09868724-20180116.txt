The present invention relates to novel retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγ) modulators and their use in the treatment of diseases mediated by RORγ.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Retinoid-related orphan receptors (RORs) are transcription factors which belong to the steroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily (Jetten & Joo (2006) Adv. Dev. Biol. 16:313-355). The ROR family consists of three members, ROR alpha (RORα), ROR beta (RORβ) and ROR gamma (RORγ), each encoded by a separate gene (RORA, RORB and RORC, respectively). RORs contain four principal domains shared by the majority of nuclear receptors: an N-terminal A/B domain, a DNA-binding domain, a hinge domain, and a ligand binding domain. Each ROR gene generates several isoforms which differ only in their N-terminal A/B domain. Two isoforms of RORγ have been identified: RORγ1 and RORγt (also known as RORγ2). RORγ is a term used to describe both RORγ1 and/or RORγt.
While RORγ1 is expressed in a variety of tissues including thymus, muscle, kidney and liver, RORγt is exclusively expressed in the cells of the immune system. RORγt has been identified as a key regulator of Th17 cell differentiation. Th17 cells are a subset of T helper cells which produce IL-17 and other proinflammatory cytokines. Th17 cells have been shown to have key functions in several mouse autoimmune disease models including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). In addition, Th17 cells or their products have been shown to be associated with the pathology of a variety of human inflammatory and autoimmune disorders including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease and asthma (Jetten (2009) Nucl. Recept. Signal. 7: e003; Manel et al. (2008) Nat. Immunol. 9:641-649; Miossec & Kolls (2012) Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 10:763-776). The pathogenesis of chronic autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis arises from the break in tolerance towards self-antigens and the development of auto-aggressive effector T cells infiltrating the target tissues. Studies have shown that Th17 cells are one of the important drivers of the inflammatory process in tissue-specific autoimmunity (Steinman (2008) J. Exp. Med. 205:1517-1522; Leung et al. (2010) Cell. Mol. Immunol. 7:182-189). There is evidence that Th17 cells are activated during the disease process and are responsible for recruiting other inflammatory cells types, especially neutrophils, to mediate pathology in the target tissues (Korn et al. (2009) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 27:485-517).
RORγt plays a critical role in the pathogenic responses of Th17 cells (Ivanov et al. (2006) Cell 126:1121-1133). RORγt deficient mice show very little Th17 cells. In addition, RORγt deficiency resulted in amelioration of EAE. Further support for the role of RORγt in the pathogenesis of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases can be found in the following references: Jetten & Joo (2006) Adv. Dev. Biol. 16:313-355; Meier et al. (2007) Immunity 26:643-654; Aloisi & Pujol-Borrell (2006) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 6:205-217; Jager et al. (2009) J. Immunol. 183:7169-7177; Serafini et al. (2004) Brain Pathol. 14:164-174; Magliozzi et al. (2007) Brain 130:1089-1104; Barnes (2008) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 8:183-192; Miossec & Kolls (2012) Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 10:763-776.
In light of the role RORγ plays in the pathogenesis of diseases, it is desirable to prepare compounds that modulate RORγ activity, which can be used in the treatment of diseases mediated by RORγ.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Terms and Definitions
“Alkyl” refers to a monovalent saturated hydrocarbon chain having the specified number of member atoms. For example, C1-C6 alkyl refers to an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 member atoms. Alkyl groups may be optionally substituted with one or more substituent as defined herein. Alkyl groups may be straight or branched. Representative branched alkyl groups have one, two, or three branches. Examples of alkyl include methyl, ethyl, propyl (n-propyl and isopropyl), butyl (n-butyl, isobutyl, and t-butyl), pentyl (n-pentyl, isopentyl, and neopentyl), and hexyl.
“Cycloalkyl” refers to a saturated hydrocarbon ring having the specified number of member atoms. Cycloalkyl groups are monocyclic ring systems or are fused or bridged bicyclic ring systems. For example, C3-C7 cycloalkyl refers to a cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 7 member atoms. Cycloalkyl groups may be optionally substituted with one or more substituent as defined herein. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl.
“Enantiomeric excess” or “ee” is the excess of one enantiomer over the other expressed as a percentage. As a result, since both enantiomers are present in equal amounts in a racemic mixture, the enantiomeric excess is zero (0% ee). However, if one enantiomer was enriched such that it constitutes 95% of the product, then the enantiomeric excess would be 90% ee (the amount of the enriched enantiomer, 95%, minus the amount of the other enantiomer, 5%).
“Enantiomerically pure” refers to products whose enantiomeric excess is 99% ee or greater.
“Half-life” refers to the time required for half of a quantity of a substance to be converted to another chemically distinct species in vitro or in vivo.
“Halo” refers to the halogen radicals fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo.
“Heteroaryl” refers to an aromatic ring containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms as member atoms in the ring. Heteroaryl groups containing more than one heteroatom may contain different heteroatoms. Heteroaryl groups may be optionally substituted with one or more substituent as defined herein. Heteroaryl groups are monocyclic ring systems or are fused or bridged bicyclic ring systems. Monocyclic heteroaryl rings have from 5 to 7 member atoms. Bicyclic heteroaryl rings have from 7 to 11 member atoms. Bicyclic heteroaryl rings include those rings wherein phenyl and a monocyclic heterocycloalkyl ring are attached forming a fused, spiro, or bridged bicyclic ring system, and those rings wherein a monocyclic heteroaryl ring and a monocyclic cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocycloalkyl, or heteroaryl ring are attached forming a fused, spiro, or bridged bicyclic ring system. Examples of heteroaryl include pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, furanyl, furazanyl, thienyl, triazolyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, triazinyl, tetrazinyl, tetrazolyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, indolizinyl, indazolyl, purinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl, pteridinyl, cinnolinyl, benzimidazolyl, furopyridinyl, and naphthyridinyl. As used herein, “5 to 6 membered monocyclic heteroaryl” represents a group or moiety comprising an aromatic monovalent monocyclic radical, containing 5 or 6 ring atoms, including at least one carbon atom and 1 to 4 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Selected 5-membered monocyclic heteroaryl groups contain one nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur ring heteroatom, and optionally contain 1, 2, or 3 additional nitrogen ring atoms. Selected 6-membered monocyclic heteroaryl groups contain 1, 2, or 3 nitrogen ring heteroatoms. Illustrative examples of 5 to 6 membered monocyclic heteroaryl groups useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, furanyl, furazanyl, thienyl, triazolyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, triazinyl, tetrazinyl, and tetrazolyl.
“Heteroatom” refers to a nitrogen, sulphur, or oxygen atom.
“Heterocycloalkyl” refers to a saturated ring containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms as member atoms in the ring. However, heterocycloalkyl rings are not aromatic. Heterocycloalkyl groups containing more than one heteroatom may contain different heteroatoms. Heterocycloalkyl groups may be optionally substituted with one or more substituent as defined herein. Heterocycloalkyl groups are monocyclic ring systems or are fused, spiro, or bridged bicyclic ring systems. Monocyclic heterocycloalkyl rings have from 4 to 7 member atoms. Bicyclic heterocycloalkyl rings have from 7 to 11 member atoms. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include pyrrolidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, dihydrofuranyl, pyranyl, tetrahydropyranyl, dihydropyranyl, tetrahydrothienyl, pyrazolidinyl, oxazolidinyl, thiazolidinyl, piperidinyl, homopiperidinyl, piperazinyl, morpholinyl, thiamorpholinyl, azepinyl, 1,3-dioxolanyl, 1,3-dioxanyl, 1,3-oxathiolanyl, 1,3-dithianyl, azetidinyl, oxetanyl, azabicylo[3.2.1]octyl, and oxabicylo[2.2.1]heptyl.
“Member atoms” refers to the atom or atoms that form a chain or ring. Where more than one member atom is present in a chain and within a ring, each member atom is covalently bound to an adjacent member atom in the chain or ring. Atoms that make up a substituent group on a chain or ring are not member atoms in the chain or ring.
“Optionally substituted” indicates that a group, such as alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocycloalkyl, or heteroaryl, may be unsubstituted, or the group may be substituted with one or more substituent as defined.
“RORγ” refers to all isoforms encoded by the RORC gene which include RORγ1 and RORγt.
“RORγ modulator” refers to a chemical compound that inhibits, either directly or indirectly, the activity of RORγ. RORγ modulators include antagonists and inverse agonists of RORγ.
“Pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, and dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
“Substituted” in reference to a group indicates that one or more hydrogen atom attached to a member atom within the group is replaced with a substituent selected from the group of defined substituents. It should be understood that the term “substituted” includes the implicit provision that such substitution be in accordance with the permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent and that the substitution results in a stable compound (i.e. one that does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, or elimination and that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation from a reaction mixture). When it is stated that a group may contain one or more substituent, one or more (as appropriate) member atom within the group may be substituted. In addition, a single member atom within the group may be substituted with more than one substituent as long as such substitution is in accordance with the permitted valence of the atom.

The compounds according to Formula I may contain one or more asymmetric center (also referred to as a chiral center) and may, therefore, exist as individual enantiomers, diastereomers, or other stereoisomeric forms, or as mixtures thereof. Chiral centers, such as chiral carbon atoms, may also be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. Where the stereochemistry of a chiral center present in Formula I, or in any chemical structure illustrated herein, is not specified the structure is intended to encompass all individual stereoisomers and all mixtures thereof. Thus, compounds according to Formula I containing one or more chiral center may be used as racemic mixtures, enantiomerically enriched mixtures, or as enantiomerically pure individual stereoisomers.
Individual stereoisomers of a compound according to Formula I which contain one or more asymmetric center may be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, such resolution may be carried out (1) by formation of diastereoisomeric salts, complexes or other derivatives; (2) by selective reaction with a stereoisomer-specific reagent, for example by enzymatic oxidation or reduction; or (3) by gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example, on a chiral support such as silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. The skilled artisan will appreciate that where the desired stereoisomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step is required to liberate the desired form. Alternatively, specific stereoisomers may be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer to the other by asymmetric transformation.
The compounds according to Formula I may also contain double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry. Where the stereochemistry of a center of geometric asymmetry present in Formula I, or in any chemical structure illustrated herein, is not specified, the structure is intended to encompass the trans (E) geometric isomer, the cis (Z) geometric isomer, and all mixtures thereof. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also included in Formula I whether such tautomers exist in equilibrium or predominately in one form.
In certain embodiments, compounds according to Formula I may be present as a free base or free acid.
In certain embodiments, compounds according to Formula I may contain an acidic functional group. In certain other embodiments, compounds according to Formula I may contain a basic functional group. Thus, the skilled artisan will appreciate that pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of the compounds according to Formula I may be prepared. Indeed, in certain embodiments of the invention, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of the compounds according to Formula I may be preferred over the respective free base or free acid because such salts may impart greater stability or solubility to the molecule thereby facilitating formulation into a dosage form. Accordingly, the invention is further directed to the use of pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of the compounds according to Formula I.
As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically-acceptable salts” refers to salts that retain the desired biological activity of the subject compound and exhibit minimal undesired toxicological effects. These pharmaceutically-acceptable salts may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compound, or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid or free base form with a suitable base or acid, respectively. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those described by Berge, Bighley, and Monkhouse, J. Pharm. Sci. (1977) 66, pp 1-19.
Salts of the disclosed compounds containing a basic amine or other basic functional group may be prepared by any suitable method known in the art, including treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, alpha-hydroxy acid, such as citric acid or tartaric acid, amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid or the like. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates, caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates, oxalates, malonates succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, butyne-1,4-dioates, hexyne-1,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates, methylbenzoates, dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutrates, citrates, lactates, γ-hydroxybutyrates, glycolates, tartrates mandelates, and sulfonates, such as xylenesulfonates, methanesulfonates, propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1-sulfonates and naphthalene-2-sulfonates.
Salts of the disclosed compounds containing an acidic functional group can be prepared by reacting with a suitable base. Such a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be made with a base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation, which includes alkali metal salts (especially sodium and potassium), alkaline earth metal salts (especially calcium and magnesium), aluminum salts and ammonium salts, as well as salts made from physiologically acceptable organic bases such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, morpholine, pyridine, piperidine, picoline, dicyclohexylamine, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, 2-hydroxyethylamine, bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, procaine, dibenzylpiperidine, dehydroabietylamine, N,N′-bisdehydroabietylamine, glucamine, N-methylglucamine, collidine, choline, quinine, quinoline, and basic amino acid such as lysine and arginine.
Other salts, which are not pharmaceutically acceptable, may be useful in the preparation of compounds of this invention and these should be considered to form a further aspect of the invention. These salts, such as trifluoroacetate, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be useful in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
If a compound of the invention containing a basic amine or other basic functional group is isolated as a salt, the corresponding free base form of that compound may be prepared by any suitable method known to the art, including treatment of the salt with an inorganic or organic base, suitably an inorganic or organic base having a higher pKa than the free base form of the compound.
Similarly, if a compound of the invention containing an acidic functional group is isolated as a salt, the corresponding free acid form of that compound may be prepared by any suitable method known to the art, including treatment of the salt with an inorganic or organic acid, suitably an inorganic or organic acid having a lower pKa than the free acid form of the compound.
As used herein, the term “compounds of the invention” means both the compounds according to Formula I (as a free base or free acid) and the pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof. The term “a compound of the invention” also appears herein and refers to both a compound according to Formula I (as a free base or free acid) and its pharmaceutically-acceptable salts.
The invention also includes various deuterated forms of the compounds of Formula (I). Each available hydrogen atom attached to a carbon atom may be independently replaced with a deuterium atom. A person of ordinary skill in the art will know how to synthesize deuterated forms of the compounds of Formula (I). Commercially available deuterated starting materials may be employed in the preparation of deuterated forms of the compounds of Formula (I), or they may be synthesized using conventional techniques employing deuterated reagents (e.g. lithium aluminum deuteride).
The compounds of the invention may exist in solid or liquid form. In the solid state, the compounds of the invention may exist in crystalline or noncrystalline form, or as a mixture thereof. For compounds of the invention that are in crystalline form, the skilled artisan will appreciate that pharmaceutically-acceptable solvates may be formed wherein solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystalline lattice during crystallization. Solvates may involve nonaqueous solvents such as ethanol, isopropanol, DMSO, acetic acid, ethanolamine, and ethyl acetate, or they may involve water as the solvent that is incorporated into the crystalline lattice. Solvates wherein water is the solvent that is incorporated into the crystalline lattice are typically referred to as “hydrates.” Hydrates include stoichiometric hydrates as well as compositions containing variable amounts of water. The invention includes all such solvates.
The skilled artisan will further appreciate that certain compounds of the invention that exist in crystalline form, including the various solvates thereof, may exhibit polymorphism (i.e. the capacity to occur in different crystalline structures). These different crystalline forms are typically known as “polymorphs.” The invention includes all such polymorphs. Polymorphs have the same chemical composition but differ in packing, geometrical arrangement, and other descriptive properties of the crystalline solid state. Polymorphs, therefore, may have different physical properties such as shape, density, hardness, deformability, stability, and dissolution properties. Polymorphs typically exhibit different melting points, IR spectra, and X-ray powder diffraction patterns, which may be used for identification. The skilled artisan will appreciate that different polymorphs may be produced, for example, by changing or adjusting the reaction conditions or reagents, used in making the compound. For example, changes in temperature, pressure, or solvent may result in polymorphs. In addition, one polymorph may spontaneously convert to another polymorph under certain conditions.
The compounds of Formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the use of at least one other therapeutically active agent. A compound of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the other therapeutically active agent(s) may be administered together in a single pharmaceutical composition or separately and, when administered separately this may occur simultaneously or sequentially in any order.
In a further aspect, there is provided a combination product comprising a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with one or more other therapeutically active agents, and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.
Suitable other therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, (1) TNF-alpha inhibitors; (2) non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors; (3) COX-2 inhibitors; (4) other agents for treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including glucocorticoids, methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, azathioprine, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, penicillamine, bucillamine, actarit, mizoribine, lobenzarit, ciclesonide, hydroxychloroquine, d-penicillamine, aurothiomalate, auranofin or parenteral or oral gold, cyclophosphamide, Lymphostat-B, BAFF/APRIL inhibitors, such as belimumab, and CTLA-4-Ig or mimetics thereof; (5) leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitor or 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) antagonist; (6) LTD4 receptor antagonist; (7) PDE4 inhibitor; (8) antihistamine H1 receptor antagonists; (9) a1- and a2-adrenoceptor agonist; (10) anticholinergic agents; (11) β-adrenoceptor agonists; (12) insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-1) mimetic; (13) glucocorticosteroids; (14) kinase inhibitors such as inhibitors of the Janus Kinases (JAK 1 and/or JAK2 and/or JAK 3 and/or TYK2), p38 MAPK and IKK2; (15) B-cell targeting biologies such as rituximab; (16) selective costimulation modulators such as abatacept; (17) interleukin inhibitors, such as IL-1 inhibitor anakinra, IL-6 inhibitors tocilizumab or sirukumab, IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor ustekinumab, IL-23 inhibitor guselkumab, and anti-IL17 antibodies; (18) anti-GM-CSF antibodies; (19) checkpoint blockade and other immunotherapies, such as anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies, including pembrolizumab and nivolumab, and anti-CTLA4 antibodies, including ipilimumab; (20) BET inhibitors, such as GSK525762; and (21) other oncology agents, such as fluorouracil, bevacizumab, irinotecan hydrochloride, capecitabine, cetuximab, ramucirumab, oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, panitumumab, regorafenib, ziv-aflibercept, trastuzumab, imatinib mesylate, sunitinib malate, sorafenib tosylate, paclitaxel, everolimus, erlotinib hydrochloride, gemcitabine hydrochloride, mitomycin C, dabrafenib, trametinib, lapatinib, ofatumumab, topotecan, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and ibrutinib.
Compound Preparation
The compounds according to Formula I may be prepared using conventional organic syntheses. Suitable synthetic routes are depicted below in the following general reaction scheme.
The skilled artisan will appreciate that if a substituent described herein is not compatible with the synthetic methods described herein, the substituent may be protected with a suitable protecting group that is stable to the reaction conditions. The protecting group may be removed at a suitable point in the reaction sequence to provide a desired intermediate or target compound. Suitable protecting groups and the methods for protecting and de-protecting different substituents using such suitable protecting groups are well known to those skilled in the art; examples of which may be found in T. Greene and P. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Chemical Synthesis (3rd ed.), John Wiley & Sons, NY (1999). In some instances, a substituent may be specifically selected to be reactive under the reaction conditions used. Under these circumstances, the reaction conditions convert the selected substituent into another substituent that is either useful as an intermediate compound or is a desired substituent in a target compound. [Exemplary conditions: a) BH3.THF, THF, 0° C.-RT; b) PCC, CH2Cl2; c) NaBH(OAc)3, HOAc, DCM, 3; d) Pd, H2, ethanol, RT; e) R1CO2H, HOBt, EDC, DMF; f) TFA, DCM; g) R7CO2H, HOBt, EDC, DMF].
Scheme 1 represents a general reaction scheme for preparing compounds of Formula I where R1 to R7 are as defined above. The starting material or reagents described are either commercially available or made from commercially available starting materials using methods known to those skilled in the art.
Benzoic acids 1 was reduced by BH3.THF to provide benzyl alcohols 2. Alcohols 2 were oxidized by PCC to corresponding aldehydes followed by reductive amination with 3 to provide nitro compounds 4. Reduction of nitro compounds 4 with Pd in the presence of H2 afforded the amines which were reacted with various acids to give amides 5. The Boc protection of 5 was removed by treatment with TFA and the resulting amines reacted with various acids to provide final compounds of Formula I.

Fluorescence Energy Transfer (FRET) Assay
The assays were performed in an assay buffer consisting of 50 mM NaF, 50 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, pH 7.5, 50 μM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-propanesulfonate, 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, and 10 mM dithiothreitol in 384-well plates (Greiner 784076, Longwood, Fla.). The total volume was 10 μL/well. The europium-labeled SRC1 solution was prepared by adding an appropriate amount of biotinylated SRC and europium labeled streptavidin (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Waltham, Mass.) into assay buffer, with final concentrations of 27 and 3.3 nM, respectively. The allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled-LBD solution was prepared by adding an appropriate amount of biotinylated RORγ-LBD and APC-labeled streptavidin (CR130-100; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) at a final concentration of 33 nM each. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, a 20-fold excess of biotin was added to block the remaining free streptavidin. Equal volumes of europium-labeled SRC- and APC-labeled RORγ-LBD were then mixed with 0.2 μM surrogate agonist N-(2-chloro-6-fluorobenzyl)-N-((2′-methoxy-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)methyl)benzenesulfonamide (Zhang, W., et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 2012, 82, 583-590) and dispensed into 384-well assay plates at 10 μL volume/well. The 384-well assay plates had 100 nL of test compound in DMSO predispensed into each well. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then read on ViewLux (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) in LANCE mode configured for europeum-APC labels. Data were collected and analyzed by Activitybase.
Dual Fluorescence Energy Transfer (FRET) Assay
This assay is based on the knowledge that nuclear receptors interact with cofactors (transcription factors) in a ligand dependent manner. RORγ is a typical nuclear receptor in that it has an AF2 domain in the ligand binding domain (LBD) which interacts with co-activators. The sites of interaction have been mapped to the LXXLL motifs in the co-activator SRC1(2) sequences. Short peptide sequences containing the LXXLL motif mimic the behavior of full-length co-activator.
The assay measures ligand-mediated interaction of the co-activator peptide with the purified bacterial-expressed RORγ ligand binding domain (RORγ-LBD) to indirectly assess ligand binding. RORγ has a basal level of interaction with the co-activator SRC1(2) in the absence of ligand, thus it is possible to find ligands that inhibit or enhance the RORγ/SRC1(2) interaction.
Materials
Generation of RORγ-LBD Bacterial Expression Plasmid
Human RORγ Ligand Binding Domain (RORγ-LBD) was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) as an amino-terminal polyhistidine tagged fusion protein. DNA encoding this recombinant protein was sub-cloned into a modified pET21a expression vector (Novagen). A modified polyhistidine tag (MKKHHHHHHLVPRGS) was fused in frame to residues 263-518 of the human RORγ sequence.
Protein Purification
Approximately 50 g E. coli cell pellet was resuspended in 300 mL of lysis buffer (30 mM imidazole pH 7.0 and 150 mM NaCl). Cells were lysed by sonication and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 20,000 g at 4° C. The cleared supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 uM cellulose acetate membrane filter. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a column (XK-26) packed with ProBond Nickel Chelating resin (Invitrogen), pre-equilibrated with 30 mM imidazole pH 7.0 and 150 mM NaCl. After washing to baseline absorbance with the equilibration buffer, the column was developed with a gradient from 30 to 500 mM imidazole pH 7.0. Column fractions containing the RORγ-LBD protein were pooled and concentrated to a volume of 5 mls. The concentrated protein was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.2 and 200 mM NaCl. The fractions containing the desired RORγ-LBD protein were pooled together.
Protein Biotinylation
Purified RORγ-LBD was buffer exchanged by exhaustive dialysis [3 changes of at least 20 volumes (>8000×)] against PBS [100 mM NaPhosphate, pH 8 and 150 mM NaCl]. The concentration of RORγ-LBD was approximately 30 uM in PBS. Five-fold molar excess of NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) was added in a minimal volume of PBS. This solution was incubated with occasional gentle mixing for 60 minutes at ambient RT. The modified RORγ-LBD was dialyzed against 2 buffer changes—TBS pH 8.0 containing 5 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA and 2% sucrose—each at least 20 times of the volume. The modified protein was distributed into aliquots, frozen on dry ice and stored at −80° C. The biotinylated RORγ-LBD was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis to reveal the extent of modification by the biotinylation reagent. In general, approximately 95% of the protein had at least a single site of biotinylation and the overall extent of biotinylation followed a normal distribution of multiple sites ranged from one to five. A biotinylated peptide corresponding to amino acid 676 to 700 (CPSSHSSLTERHKILHRLLQEGSPS) of the co-activator steroid receptor coactivator SRC1(2) was generated using similar method.
Assay
Preparation of Europium labeled SRC1(2) peptide: biotinylated SRC1(2) solution was prepared by adding an appropriate amount of biotinylated SRC1(2) from the 100 uM stock solution to a buffer containing 10 mM of freshly added DTT from solid to give a final concentration of 40 nM. An appropriate amount of Europium labeled Streptavidin was then added to the biotinylated SRC1(2) solution in a tube to give a final concentration of 10 nM. The tube was inverted gently and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Twenty-fold excess biotin from the 10 mM stock solution was added and the tube was inverted gently and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Preparation of APC labeled RORγ-LBD: biotinylated RORγ-LBD solution was prepared by adding an appropriate amount of biotinylated RORγ-LBD from the stock solution to a buffer containing 10 mM of freshly added DTT from solid to give a final concentration of 40 nM. An appropriate amount of APC labeled Streptavidin was then added to the biotinylated RORγ-LBD solution in a tube to give a final concentration of 20 nM. The tube was inverted gently and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Twenty-fold excess biotin from the 10 mM stock solution was then added and the tube was inverted gently and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Equal volumes of the above-described Europium labeled SRC1(2) peptide and the APC labeled RORγ-LBD were gently mixed together to give 20 nM RORγ-LBD, 10 nM APC-Strepavidin, 20 nM SRC1(2) and 5 nM Europium-Streptavidin. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 minutes. Using a Thermo Combi Multidrop 384 stacker unit, 25 ul of the reaction mixtures per well was added to the 384-well assay plates containing 1 ul of test compound per well in 100% DMSO. The plates were incubated for 1 hr and then read on ViewLux in Lance mode for EU/APC.
Jurkat Cell Luciferase Assay
RORγ is known to bind to a CNS (conserved non-coding sequences) enhancer element in the IL17 promoter. In this assay, RORγ activity is indirectly assessed using a luciferase reporter construct which contains the human IL17 promoter having the RORγ-specific CNS enhancer element. Inhibition of RORγ activity by a compound will result in a decrease in luciferase activity of Jurkat cells transfected with the reporter construct.
Materials
Jurkat Cell Line
For the luciferase reporter plasmid, the 3 Kb human IL17 promoter containing the RORγ-specific CNS enhancer element was PCR amplified from human genomic DNA and cloned into a pGL4-Luc2/hygro reporter plasmid sequentially as XhoI-HindIII (1.1 Kb) and KpnI-XhoI (1.9 Kb) fragments. For the 1.1 Kb fragment, PCR was used to amplify human IL17 proximal promoter region from genomic DNA of 293T cells using primers as follows: forward primer, 5′-CTCGAGTAGAGCAGGACAGGGAGGAA-3′ (XhoI site is underlined) and reverse primer, 5′-AAGCTTGGATGGATGAGTTTGTGCCT-3′ (HindIII site is underlined). The 1.1 kb DNA bands were excised, purified, and inserted into pMD19-T Simple Vector (Takara). After DNA sequencing confirmation, the 1.1 kb DNA was digested with XhoI and HindIII and inserted into XhoI/HindIII sites of pGL4.31 [luc2P/GAL4UAS/Hygro] (Promega) to generate the pIL17-1 kb-luc reporter construct. For the 1.9 Kb fragment, PCR was used to amplify human IL17 promoter region from genomic DNA using primers as follows: forward primer, 5′-GGTACCTGCCCTGCTCTATCCTGAGT-3′ (KpnI site is underlined) and reverse primer, 5′-CTCGAGTGGTGAGTGCTGAGAGATGG-3′ (XhoI site is underlined). The resulting 1.9 kb DNA bands were excised, gel purified, and cloned into a pMD19-T Simple Vector (Takara). DNA sequencing analysis revealed that there were three point mutations but none of which affected RORγ binding. The 1.9 kb DNA fragment was released by double digestion with KpnI and XhoI and inserted into pIL17-1 kb-luc to generate the luciferase reporter plasmid “pIL17-3 kb-CNS-luc.” To overexpress RORγt, the full-length cDNA of human RORγt identical to the published sequence NM_001001523 was cloned into pcDNA3.1 at the KpnI-NotI cloning sites to generate the RORγt overexpression plasmid “CDNA3.1DhRORγ49-8”.
The luciferase reporter plasmid and the RORγt overexpression plasmid were transfected into Jurkat cell line and a stable clone was identified. The stable clone was grown in 10% dialyzed FBS in RPMI (1640) with 800 ug/ml geneticin and 400 ug/ml hygromecin.
Assay
Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at three concentrations, 10 mM, 400 uM and 16 uM, and were dispensed into 384-wells assay plate at 40 nl, 12.5 nl, 5 nl respectively. The volume was adjusted with pure DMSO to a give a final uniform volume of 40 nl Jurkat cells described above were counted and centrifuged. The growth medium was discarded and the cells were resuspended with assay medium (phenol red free RPMI) at 1E-6/ml. Cells were added to each of the compounds in the assay plates. Cells were either untreated or treated with CD3 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) at 1 ul beads per 500,000 cells. Cells were culture overnight and luciferase assay (Promega) was performed. Data were collected by ViewLux (using luciferase greiner 384 setting).
Th17 Cell Differentiation Assay
ELISA
Mouse CD4+ cells were purified using the CD4+ T Cell Isolation II Kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). 96 well plates were pre-coated with anti-mCD3 antibody. Un-coated wells were used as controls. CD4+ Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 complete medium and were added to the 96-well plates. Cytokine cocktail and the compound were then added to the wells. Antibodies and cytokines (all from R&D Systems) used in the assay were selected from the following: anti-mCD3; anti-mCD28; anti-mIFNγ; anti-mIL4; mIL-6; mIL-23; mIL-1β; hTGF-β1. The culture was incubated at 37° C. for 3 days and supernatants were collected for ELISA. The IL-17 ELISAs were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems). The results were analyzed using Prism software with non-linear regression to determine pIC50.

EAE Studies
Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model of multiple sclerosis. The ability of a test compound to ameliorate EAE can be measured in the EAE studies. Wild-type mice of the C57BL/6 (B6) strain are maintained under pathogen-free conditions. EAE is induced by intravenous injections of 100 ng of pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories) and subcutaneous immunization with an emulsion composed of MOG35-55 peptide (300 μg/mouse) in PBS and an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant containing 5 mg/ml heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Difco Laboratories) on day 0, followed by another intravenous injections of 100 ng of pertussis toxin on day 2 as described previously (Wang et al. (2006) J. Clin. Invest. 116: 2434-2441). For treatment of EAE, each compound or vehicle PBS is given orally from day 0 at various doses selected from 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg twice a day. Mice are scored for disease severity daily using a EAE scoring system (Wang et al. (2006) J. Clin. Invest. 116: 2434-2441): 0, no overt signs of disease; 1, limp tail or hind limb weakness but not both; 2, limptail and paraparesis (weakness, incomplete paralysis of one or two hind limbs); 3, paraplegia (complete paralysis of two hind limbs); 4, paraplegia with forelimb weakness or paralysis; and 5, moribund state or death. Clinical score data can be expressed as means±S.E.M.
In Vitro Percutaneous Studies
The in vitro percutaneous study is aimed to predict the level of percutaneous penetration obtained for a compound in a topical formulation for psoriasis. This assay coupled with the intrinsic potency of the compound are used to predict the likelihood of success of a compound to engage the target. The higher the ratio of the percutaneous penetration to the intrinsic potency, the higher the ratio of local skin concentration to the intrinsic potency and therefore the higher the chance of a compound to engage the target in a topical formulation.
The compounds can be manufactured in a modified aqueous cream at pH=6.

The study can be conducted with dermatomed abdominal human skin sourced from three skin donors using 2 cm2 Franz diffusion cells. The receiving fluid consisted of Bovine serum albumin (4% w/v) in 0.1% w/v sodium azide in Phospate Buffer Saline and can be heated at 37° C. in order to obtain 32° C. at the skin surface. The cream formulation can be applied on the donor side at a 10 mg dose, i.e. 5 mg/cm2. The samples can be taken at the following time points: t=0, 3, 6, 9 and 24 h. The receiver samples can then be assayed using a method based upon protein precipitation with acetonitrile followed by LC/MS/MS analysis. The percutaneous flux (in ng/cm2/hr) can be determined using the individual API (in a multiple composition) that has permeated into the receiver compartment over 24 hrs per cm2.
Imiquimod-Induced Skin Inflammation
Imiquimod is an immune modifying agent that potently activates specific Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR7) and induces irritation/inflammation of the skin that requires the IL23R/RORγ/IL17 axis of the immune system (van der Fits et al, (2009) J Immunol; 182:5836-5845; Gray et al, (2013) Nature Immunol; June; 14(6):584-92). The imiquimod-induced skin inflammation model can be used to assess the ability of an RORγ inhibitor to reduce Th17-driven inflammation in mice. For the ear-only skin inflammation model in which ear thickness is measured with digital engineer's calipers (Mitutoyo PK-0505), female wild type C57BL/6NTac mice can be obtained from Taconic (Hudson, N.Y.) at 8 to 12 wk of age and given a daily topical dose of 10 mg of commercially available imiquimod cream (5%) (Aldara; Medicis) distributed over both ears at approximately 11:00 h for up to 4 consecutive days. Alternatively, 72 mg of Aldara is distributed over both ears and the shaved/depiliated back skin of mice at approximately 11:00 h for 3 consecutive days to examine RORγ-dependent gene expression (RNA isolated from both ears using Qiazol followed by clean-up on with the RNeasy protocol (Qiagen, Germantown, Md.); Taqman probe/primer sets for B2M (Mm00437762_m1), IL-17A (Mm00439619_m1), IL-17F (Mm00521423_m1), or IL-22 (Mm00444241_m1) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, Mass.) and ex vivo stimulated (anti-CD3 (2 ug/ml, clone eBio500A2, eBioscience, San Diego, Calif.), anti-CD28 (1 ug/ml, clone 37.51, BD Bioscience, San Jose, Calif.), recombinant mouse IL-13 (20 ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.), and recombinant mouse IL-23 (20 ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) IL-17A protein expression from whole blood (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, Md.). For treatment of the skin inflammation in these models, each compound or vehicle (methylcellulose in water, 1% w/v, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) is administered via oral gavage at approximately 08:00 h and 16:00 h daily at various doses selected from 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg.

The CD4+ T cells are differentiated to the Th17 subtype by culturing for 5 days in tissue culture plates coated with anti-CD3 antibody (2 μg/mL) in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) containing 10% HI-FBS, 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol and soluble anti-CD28 (3 μg/mL) in the presence of a Th17 skewing cocktail, including IL-1β (10 ng/mL), IL-6 (30 ng/mL), TGFβ (0.5 ng/mL), IL-21 (10 ng/mL), IL-23 (10 ng/mL), anti-IFNγ (10 μg/mL) and anti-IL-4 (10 μg/mL). To examine compound effects on Th17 polarization, freshly thawed CD4+ cells in IMDM supplemented with all Th17 polarization cocktail constituents (above) are seeded at low cell density (20,000 cells/well) directly into anti-CD3 coated round bottom 96-well plates already containing serially diluted compounds. Cells are incubated undisturbed for 5 days at 37° C. Immediately following culture, supernatant is analyzed for secreted IL-17A and IL-22 protein by MSD electrochemiluminescent cytokine assays (Mesoscale Discovery) and ELISA (Quantikine assay, R&D Systems), respectively. Compound treatment(s) may be performed in triplicate.

As used herein, “treat” in reference to a condition means: (1) to ameliorate or prevent the condition or one or more of the biological manifestations of the condition, (2) to interfere with (a) one or more points in the biological cascade that leads to or is responsible for the condition or (b) one or more of the biological manifestations of the condition, (3) to alleviate one or more of the symptoms or effects associated with the condition, or (4) to slow the progression of the condition or one or more of the biological manifestations of the condition.
As indicated above, “treatment” of a condition includes prevention of the condition. The skilled artisan will appreciate that “prevention” is not an absolute term. In medicine, “prevention” is understood to refer to the prophylactic administration of a drug to substantially diminish the likelihood or severity of a condition or biological manifestation thereof, or to delay the onset of such condition or biological manifestation thereof.
The compounds of the invention may be administered by any suitable route of administration, including both systemic administration and topical administration. Systemic administration includes oral administration, parenteral administration, transdermal administration, rectal administration, and administration by inhalation. Parenteral administration refers to routes of administration other than enteral, transdermal, or by inhalation, and is typically by injection or infusion. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous injection or infusion. Inhalation refers to administration into the human lungs whether inhaled through the mouth or through the nasal passages. Topical administration includes application to the skin as well as intraocular, otic, intravaginal, and intranasal administration.
The compounds of the invention may be administered once or according to a dosing regimen wherein a number of doses are administered at varying intervals of time for a given period of time. For example, doses may be administered one, two, three, or four times per day. Doses may be administered until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved or indefinitely to maintain the desired therapeutic effect. Suitable dosing regimens for a compound of the invention depend on the pharmacokinetic properties of that compound, such as absorption, distribution, and half-life, which can be determined by the skilled artisan. In addition, suitable dosing regimens, including the duration such regimens are administered, for a compound of the invention depend on the condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age and physical condition of the individual being treated, the medical history of the individual to be treated, the nature of concurrent therapy, the desired therapeutic effect, and like factors within the knowledge and expertise of the skilled artisan. It will be further understood by such skilled artisans that suitable dosing regimens may require adjustment given an individual's response to the dosing regimen or over time as individual needs change.
Typical daily dosages may vary depending upon the particular route of administration chosen. Typical daily dosages for oral administration range from 0.1 mg to 1000 mg. Typical daily dosages for topical administration range from about 0.001% to about 10% w/w (weight percent) and preferably from about 0.01% to about 1% w/w.
Additionally, the compounds of the invention may be administered as prodrugs. As used herein, a “prodrug” of a compound of the invention is a functional derivative of the compound which, upon administration to an individual, eventually liberates the compound of the invention in vivo. Administration of a compound of the invention as a prodrug may enable the skilled artisan to do one or more of the following: (a) modify the onset of the compound in vivo; (b) modify the duration of action of the compound in vivo; (c) modify the transportation or distribution of the compound in vivo; (d) modify the solubility of the compound in vivo; and (e) overcome or overcome a side effect or other difficulty encountered with the compound. Typical functional derivatives used to prepare prodrugs include modifications of the compound that are chemically or enzymatically cleaved in vivo. Such modifications, which include the preparation of phosphates, amides, esters, thioesters, carbonates, and carbamates, are well known to those skilled in the art.
Compositions
The compounds of the invention will normally, but not necessarily, be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions prior to administration to an individual. Accordingly, in another aspect the invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient.
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be prepared and packaged in bulk form wherein a safe and effective amount of a compound of the invention can be extracted and then given to the individual such as with powders or syrups. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be prepared and packaged in unit dosage form wherein each physically discrete unit contains a safe and effective amount of a compound of the invention. When prepared in unit dosage form, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention typically contain from 0.1 mg to 1000 mg.
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention typically contain one compound of the invention. However, in certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention contain more than one compound of the invention. For example, in certain embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention contain two compounds of the invention. In addition, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may optionally further comprise one or more additional pharmaceutically active compounds.
As used herein, “pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient” means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle involved in giving form or consistency to the pharmaceutical composition. Each excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition when commingled such that interactions which would substantially reduce the efficacy of the compound of the invention when administered to an individual and interactions which would result in pharmaceutical compositions that are not pharmaceutically acceptable are avoided. In addition, each excipient must of course be of sufficiently high purity to render it pharmaceutically-acceptable.
The compound of the invention and the pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient or excipients will typically be formulated into a dosage form adapted for administration to the individual by the desired route of administration. For example, dosage forms include those adapted for (1) oral administration such as tablets, capsules, caplets, pills, troches, powders, syrups, elixers, suspensions, solutions, emulsions, sachets, and cachets; (2) parenteral administration such as sterile solutions, suspensions, and powders for reconstitution; (3) transdermal administration such as transdermal patches; (4) rectal administration such as suppositories; (5) inhalation such as dry powders, aerosols, suspensions, and solutions; and (6) topical administration such as creams, ointments, lotions, solutions, pastes, sprays, foams, and gels.
Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients will vary depending upon the particular dosage form chosen. In addition, suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients may be chosen for a particular function that they may serve in the composition. For example, certain pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the production of uniform dosage forms. Certain pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the production of stable dosage forms. Certain pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the carrying or transporting of the compound or compounds of the invention once administered to the individual from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Certain pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to enhance compliance.
Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients include the following types of excipients: Diluents, fillers, binders, disintegrants, lubricants, glidants, granulating agents, coating agents, wetting agents, solvents, co-solvents, suspending agents, emulsifiers, sweetners, flavoring agents, flavor masking agents, coloring agents, anticaking agents, hemectants, chelating agents, plasticizers, viscosity increasing agents, antioxidants, preservatives, stabilizers, surfactants, and buffering agents. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients may serve more than one function and may serve alternative functions depending on how much of the excipient is present in the formulation and what other ingredients are present in the formulation.
Skilled artisans possess the knowledge and skill in the art to enable them to select suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients in appropriate amounts for use in the invention. In addition, there are a number of resources that are available to the skilled artisan which describe pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients and may be useful in selecting suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients.
