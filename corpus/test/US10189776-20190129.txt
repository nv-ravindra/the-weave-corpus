DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Used Terms and Definitions
Terms not specifically defined herein should be given the meanings that would be given to them by one of skill in the art in light of the disclosure and the context. As used in the specification, however, unless specified to the contrary, the following terms have the meaning indicated and the following conventions are adhered to.
In the groups, radicals, or moieties defined below, the number of carbon atoms is often specified preceding the group, for example, C1-6-alkyl means an alkyl group or radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.
In general in single groups like HO, H2N, S(O), S(O)2, NC (cyano), HOOC, F3C or the like, the skilled artisan can see the radical attachment point(s) to the molecule from the free valences of the group itself. For combined groups comprising two or more subgroups, the first or last named subgroup, where the free valence is indicated, for example, the substituent “aryl-C1-3-alkyl-” means an aryl group which is bound to a C1-3-alkyl-group, the latter of which is bound to the core or to the group to which the substituent is attached.
In case a compound of the present invention is depicted in form of a chemical name and as a formula in case of any discrepancy the formula shall prevail. An asterisk or a broken line may be used in sub-formulas to indicate the bond which is connected to the core molecule as defined.
For example, the term “3-carboxypropyl-group” represents the following substituent:
wherein the carboxy group is attached to the third carbon atom of the propyl group. The terms “1-methylpropyl-”, “2,2-dimethylpropyl-” or “cyclopropylmethyl-” group represent the following groups:
The asterisk may be used in sub-formulas to indicate the bond which is connected to the core molecule as defined.
Many of the following terms may be used repeatedly in the definition of a formula or group and in each case have one of the meanings given above, independently of one another.
The term “substituted” as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valence is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound.
All isomeric forms (especially all stereoisomeric forms, e.g. all chiral, enantiomeric, diastereomeric and racemic forms, all tautomeric and all geometric isomeric forms) of a compound of the present invention are intended with this invention, unless the specific isomer is specifically indicated. Obviously, the isomer which is pharmacologically more potent and/or more efficacious is preferred.
It will be appreciated that the compounds of the present invention contain at least one asymmetrically substituted carbon atom, and may therefore be isolated as pure enantiomers or as a racemic or non-racemic mixture of both enantiomers. It will be appreciated that some of the compounds of the present invention contain more than one stereogenic center, that is more than one asymmetrically substituted carbon or sulfur atom, and may therefore be isolated as pure diastereomers or as diastereomeric mixtures, both in optically active or racemic forms.
The invention contemplates all conceivable stereoisomers, particularly the diastereomers and enantiomers mentioned herein, e.g. in substantially pure form, in enriched form (e.g. substantially free of any or all other undesired enantiomers and/or diastereomers and/or in any mixing ratio, including the racemic forms, as well as the salts thereof.
In general, substantially pure stereoisomers can be obtained according to synthetic principles known to a person skilled in the field, e.g. by separation of corresponding mixtures, by using stereochemically pure starting materials and/or by stereoselective synthesis. It is known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis, e.g. starting from optically active starting materials and/or by using chiral reagents.
Enantiomerically pure compounds of this invention or intermediates may be prepared via asymmetric synthesis, for example by preparation and subsequent separation of appropriate diastereomeric compounds or intermediates which can be separated by known methods (e.g. by chromatographic separation or crystallization) and/or by using chiral reagents, such as chiral starting materials, chiral catalysts or chiral auxiliaries.
Further, it is known to the person skilled in the art how to prepare enantiomerically pure compounds from the corresponding racemic mixtures, such as by chromatographic separation of the corresponding racemic mixtures on chiral stationary phases; or by resolution of a racemic mixture using an appropriate resolving agent, e.g. by means of diastereomeric salt formation of the racemic compound with optically active acids or bases, subsequent resolution of the salts and release of the desired compound from the salt; or by derivatization of the corresponding racemic compounds with optically active chiral auxiliary reagents, subsequent diastereomer separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary group; or by kinetic resolution of a racemate (e.g. by enzymatic resolution); by enantioselective crystallization from a conglomerate of enantiomorphous crystals under suitable conditions; or by (fractional) crystallization from a suitable solvent in the presence of an optically active chiral auxiliary.
As used herein, “salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. For example, such salts include salts from ammonia, L-arginine, betaine, benethamine, benzathine, calcium hydroxide, choline, deanol, diethanolamine (2,2′-iminobis(ethanol)), diethylamine, 2-(diethylamino)-ethanol, 2-aminoethanol, ethylenediamine, N-ethyl-glucamine, hydrabamine, 1H-imidazole, lysine, magnesium hydroxide, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine, piperazine, potassium hydroxide, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-pyrrolidine, sodium hydroxide, triethanolamine (2,2′,2″-nitrilotris(ethanol)), tromethamine, zinc hydroxide, acetic acid, 2.2-dichloro-acetic acid, adipic acid, alginic acid, ascorbic acid, L-aspartic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 4-acetamido-benzoic acid, (+)-camphoric acid, (+)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid, carbonic acid, cinnamic acid, citric acid, cyclamic acid, decanoic acid, dodecylsulfuric acid, ethane-1,2-disulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, galactaric acid, gentisic acid, D-glucoheptonic acid, D-gluconic acid, D-glucuronic acid, glutamic acid, glutaric acid, 2-oxo-glutaric acid, glycerophosphoric acid, glycine, glycolic acid, hexanoic acid, hippuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, isobutyric acid, DL-lactic acid, lactobionic acid, lauric acid, lysine, maleic acid, (−)-L-malic acid, malonic acid, DL-mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, galactaric acid, naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid, naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, nicotinic acid, nitric acid, octanoic acid, oleic acid, orotic acid, oxalic acid, palmitic acid, pamoic acid (embonic acid), phosphoric acid, propionic acid, (−)-L-pyroglutamic acid, salicylic acid, 4-amino-salicylic acid, sebacic acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, sulfuric acid, tannic acid, (+)-L-tartaric acid, thiocyanic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and undecylenic acid.
