BACKGROUND
The ability to selectively target chemotherapy has immense value in clinical practice. Cancer is a leading cause of death in the developed world, with one in every three people developing cancer during his or her lifetime. There are many treatment options for cancer including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and monoclonal antibody treatment. Unfortunately, for many patients cancer treatment options are limited and response rates remain low.
Surgery is the oldest effective form of tumor therapy and can often result in a complete cure, depending of the type and nature of the tumor. Many tumors, however, occur in locations and/or number that make surgery impossible or impractical. Also, surgical debulking is not guaranteed to remove all abnormal cells, particularly in the case of tumors located in the brain where maximum preservation of normal tissue is desired. Residual abnormal cells pose an increased risk of tumor re-growth and/or metastasis.
Radiation therapy is often used as an adjunct to surgery. Various types of radiation, both from external and implanted sources, have been used with some success. Low linear-energy-transfer (LET) sources, such as β-particles and γ-rays, require repeated treatments over extended periods of time to produce any significant reduction in tumor cells. High LET sources, such as neutrons, protons or α-particles, do not require oxygen to enhance their biological effectiveness. External beam therapy has been available for decades, however, significant radiation damage occurs to normal tissues, and patients often succumb to widespread radiation-induced necrosis (Laramore, et al., Cancer, 1978, 42(1), 96-103).
Chemotherapy is used in attempts to cure or palliate cancer. Small molecule chemotherapeutics target rapidly dividing cells, halting cell proliferation by interfering with DNA replication, cytoskeletal rearrangements and/or signaling pathways that promote cell growth. Disruption of cell division slows the growth of malignant cells and may also kill tumor cells by triggering apoptosis. Alkylating agents, such as bis(2-chloroethyl)amine derivatives, act by covalent interaction with nucleophilic heteroatoms in DNA or proteins. It is believed that these difunctional agents are able to crosslink a DNA chain within a double helix in an intrastrand or interstrand fashion, or to crosslink between DNA, proteins or other vital macromolecules. The crosslinking results in inhibitory effects on DNA replication and transcription with subsequent cell death. Since these drugs also indiscriminately kill normal populations of rapidly proliferating cells, such as those found in the immune system and in the gastrointestinal tract, side effects that limit tolerated doses, are common.
The harsh side effects and the ultimate failure of most chemotherapy regimens have motivated investigation of alternatives, including drugs that target specifically tumor cells. Normal cells and tumor cells differ markedly in nutrient and energy metabolism, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect (Ganapathy, et al., Pharmacol Ther, 2009, 121(1), 29-40; and Vander Heiden, et al., Science, 2009, 324(5930), 1029-1033). Enhanced proliferation in tumor cells places increased demand for nutrients to serve as building blocks for the biosynthesis of macromolecules and as sources of energy. Tumor-selective nutrient accumulation is most clearly evident in imaging studies of human tumors using positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG accumulates at high levels in many kinds of solid tumors and is thought to be taken up into tumor cells by sugar transporters. Amino acids are the primary source of cellular nitrogen, used for nucleotide, glutathione, amino sugar, and protein synthesis. In addition, tumors often utilize the carbon skeletons of amino acids as an oxidative fuel source for ATP generation in addition to glucose and fatty acids (Baggetto, Biochimie, 1992, 74(11), 959-974; Mazurek and Eigenbrodt, 2003, Anticancer Res, 2003, 23(2A), 1149-1154; and DeBerardinis, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2007, 104(49), 19345-19350). Therefore, tumor cells must express select specific transporters to satisfy maintenance and growth requirements for nutritional amino acids. To compete with surrounding tissue for nutrients, tumor cells up-regulate levels of certain transporters to allow for more efficient extraction of nutrients than that of the host tissue.
Amino acid transport across the plasma membrane in mammalian cells is mediated by different transport “systems” such as the sodium-dependent systems A, ASC and N, and sodium-independent system L (Christensen, Phys Rev, 1990, 70, 43-77). System L is a ubiquitous plasma membrane amino acid transport system that is characterized by the sodium-independent uptake of bulky, hydrophobic amino acids and its high affinity interaction with 2-amino-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH). System L activity is presently attributed to four sodium-independent transporters (LAT1-4). However, most cancers over-express only one member, the large amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1/4F2hc). This transporter is a heterodimer consisting of a light chain (LAT1) that constitutes the transporter and a heavy chain 4F2hc (also known as CD98, or Tumor Antigene TA1) that is required for proper targeting of the light chain to the plasma membrane. The expression and activity of LAT1/4F2hc correlates with cell proliferation and cancer growth; and up-regulation of LAT1/4F2hc has been observed, for example, in cancers of brain, colon, lung, liver, pancreas, and skin (Jager, et al., J Nucl Med, 1998, 39(10), 1736-1743; Ohkame, et al., J Surg Oncol, 2001, 78(4), 265-267; Tamai, et al., Cancer Detect Prev, 2001, 25(5), 439-445; Kim, et al., Anticancer Res, 2004, 24(3a), 1671-1675; Kobayashi, et al., Neurosurgery, 2008, 62(2), 493-503; Imai, et al., Histopathology, 2009, 54(7), 804-813; and Kaira, et al., 2009, Lung Cancer, 66(1), 120-126). Furthermore, the expression of LAT1/4F2hc has been used as an independent factor to predict poor prognoses in patients with astrocytic brain tumors, lung cancer, and prostate cancer (Nawashiro, et al., Int J Canc, 2006, 119(3), 484-492; Kaira, et al., Lung Cancer, 2009, 66(1), 120-126; Kaira, et al., Cancer Sci, 2008, 99(12), 2380-2386; and Sakata, et al., Pathol Int, 2009, 59(1), 7-18). Inhibition of LAT1/4F2hc-mediated transport with non-metabolizable amino acids such as BCH can reduce growth and induce apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro (Kim, et al., Biol Pharm Bull, 2008, 31(6), 1096-1100; Shennan and Thomson, Oncol Rep, 2008, 20(4), 885-889; and Kaji, et al., Int J Gynecol Cancer, 2010, 20(3), 329-336). Clinical studies have shown that the specificity and positive predictive value of L-[3-18F]-α-methyltyrosine ([18F]-FAMT) PET is superior to [18F]-FDG PET. The uptake of [18F]-FAMT in tumors has been closely correlated with LAT1 expression (Haase, et al., J Nucl Med, 2007, 48(12), 2063-2071; Kaira, et al., Clin Cancer Res, 2007, 13(21), 6369-6378; and Urakami, et al., Nucl Med Biol, 2009, 36(3), 295-303).
In particular, melphalan is an effective chemotherapy drug used in treating multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, retinoblastoma, and other hematopoietic tumors. However, substrates such as gabapentin are reported to be transported much more rapidly than melphalan (Uchino, et al., Mol Pharmacol 2002, 61(4), 729-737). It is widely believed that uptake of melphalan (Alkeran®, otherwise known as L-Phenylalanine Mustard, or L-PAM) into cells is mediated by amino acid transporters. Melphalan is an alkylating agent linked to the essential amino acid phenylalanine. Because normal cells and tumor cells differ markedly in nutrient and energy metabolism (Warburg effect) (Vander Heiden, et al., Science, 2009, 324(5930), 1029-1033), melphalan was introduced into clinical practice with the expectation that it would preferentially accumulate in rapidly dividing tumor cells compared to normal cells, thereby increasing its overall therapeutic index. Surprisingly, melphalan caused many of the same side effects as other conventional alkylation agents, including myelosuppression. In a series of publications, Vistica et al. examined melphalan transport in different cell types and identified two independent transport systems for melphalan. One system, presumed to be System L, is characterized by the sodium-independent uptake of bulky, hydrophobic amino acids and its sensitivity toward inhibition with 2-amino-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) (Vistica, Biochim Biophys Acta, 1979, 550(2), 309-317). A second transport system is sodium-dependent, exhibits its highest affinity for leucine, but is insensitive to both BCH and the system A-specific inhibitor α-amino-isobutyric acid (AlB) (Vistica, Biochim Biophys Acta, 1979, 550(2), 309-317). Although LAT1 is overexpressed on the cell surface of almost all tumor cells regardless of the tissue of origin, response rates to melphalan are low for most cancer types, and the drug is only approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and ovarian cancer. Melphalan is a poor substrate for LAT1 compared to other large amino acids such as phenylalanine or leucine (Uchino, et al., Mol Pharmacol 2002, 61(4), 729-737; and Hosoya, et al., Biol Pharm Bull, 2008, 31(11), 2126-2130). Nitrogen mustard derivatives with higher selectivity toward the LAT1/4F2hc system could reduce side effects associated with nitrogen mustard therapy, allow for an increase in dose, and extend the use into other areas of cancer treatment.
Although the potential for active transport strategies for increasing drug uptake into tumor cells is known and generally accepted, chemotherapeutics and tumor imaging agents have in general not been optimized for transporters known to be over-expressed in tumor cells. While the general concept of using LAT1/2Fhc-selective compounds to deliver therapeutic agents to tumors is appreciated, the existing art gives no guidance as to how one prepares a composition that exploits LAT1/4F2hc selective compounds. Thus, there is a need for new therapeutic agents that are more selective toward LAT1/4F2hc.
Several amino acid-related drugs that are substrates of the LAT1/4F2hc transporter are known including L-Dopa, 3-O-methyldopa, droxidopa, carbidopa, 3,3′,5′-triiodothyronine, thyroxine, gabapentin, and melphalan (Uchino, et al., Mol Pharm 2002, 61(4), 729-737; and del Amo et al., Eur J Pharm Sci, 2008, 35(3), 161-174).

Bioisosteres are atoms or molecules that fit the broadest definition for isosteres. The concept of bioisosterism is based on the notion that single atom, groups, moieties, or whole molecules, which have chemical and physical similarities produce similar biological effects.

LAT1/4F2hc Transporter
The GenBank accession number for human LAT1/4F2hc is NP_003477/NP_002385. Unless otherwise apparent from the context, reference to a transporter such as LAT1/4F2hc (as well as other transporters disclosed herein) includes the amino acid sequence described in or encoded by the GenBank reference number, and, allelic, cognate and induced variants and fragments thereof retaining essentially the same transporter activity. Usually such variants show at least 90% sequence identity to the exemplary Genbank nucleic acid or amino acid sequence. Allelic variants at the DNA level are the result of genetic variation between individuals of the same species. Some allelic variants at the DNA level that cause substitution, deletion or insertion of amino acids in proteins encoded by the DNA result in corresponding allelic variation at the protein level. Cognate forms of a gene refer to variation between structurally and functionally related genes between species. For example, the human gene showing the greatest sequence identity and closest functional relationship to a mouse gene is the human cognate form of the mouse gene.
For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm enables calculation of the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by methods known to those skilled in the art.

Synthesis of Compounds
Compounds disclosed herein may be obtained via the general synthetic methods illustrated in Schemes 1-10. General synthetic methods useful in the synthesis of compounds, precursors, and starting materials described herein are available in the art. Starting materials useful for preparing compounds and intermediates thereof, and/or practicing methods described herein, are commercially available or may be prepared by well-known synthetic methods (March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, M. B. Smith, 7th Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, N.J., USA, 2013; Advanced Organic Chemistry: Part B: Reaction and Synthesis, F. A. Carey and R. J. Sundberg, 5th Edition, Springer, Germany, 2010; Comprehensive Organic Transformations, 2nd Edition, and R. C. Larock, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 1999).
Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, use of conventional protecting groups or protecting strategies may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well as suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are well known in the art. On the other hand, many methods for selective removal of protecting groups without affecting the desired molecular architecture are also well known in the art (Wuts and Greene, Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Ed, 2007, Wiley-Interscience, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, N.J.).
It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions, e.g., reaction temperatures, reaction times, molar ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc., are given other process conditions may also be used. Optimal reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants, solvents, functional groups, and protecting groups used, but such conditions may be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.
Furthermore, certain compounds provided by the present disclosure may contain one or more stereogenic centers. Accordingly, and if desired, such compounds may be prepared or isolated as pure stereoisomers, e.g., as individual enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers, rotamers, or as stereoisomer enriched mixtures or racemates. All such stereoisomers are included within the scope of this disclosure. Pure stereoisomers (or enriched mixtures thereof) may be prepared using, for example, optically active starting materials, stereoselective reagents such as chiral catalysts and auxiliaries well known in the art. Alternatively, racemic mixtures of such compounds may be separated or partially enriched using, for example, chromatographic methods with chiral stationary phases, chiral resolving agents, and the like, also well known in the art and easily adaptable to the particular compound to be separated.
There has been an ever growing interest in the synthesis of β-amino acids with various substitution patterns. Depending on the location and the number of the substitutents, β-amino acids are categorized as (a) β2-(mono-α-substituted), (b) β3-(mono-β-substituted), (c) β2,3-(α,β-di-substituted), (d) β2,2-(α,α-di-substituted or α-geminal-disubstituted), (e) β3,3-(β,β-di-substituted or β-geminal-di substituted), (f) β2,2,3-(α,α,β-tri-substituted), (g) β2,3,3-(α,β,β-tri-substituted), or (h) β2,2,3,3-((α,α,β,β-tetra-substituted) amino acids. Many methods for the synthesis of protected and unprotected β-amino acids with a wide variety of type and number of substituents either in racemic, enatio- or diastereomerically enriched or pure form from commercial or known starting materials are well known in the art (Enantioselective Synthesis of β-Amino Acids, 2nd Edition, E. Juaristi and V. Soloshonok, John Wiley & Sons, 2005, Hoboken, N.J., USA, 2005; Smith, Methods of Non-α-Amino Acid Synthesis, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, USA, 1995; Cole, Tetrahedron, 1994, 50 (32), 9517-9582; Juaristi, et al., Aldrich Chim.

Methods of synthetic manipulations and modifications of the underlying protected or unprotected β-amino acid scaffold are well known in the art. In certain embodiments, the underlying the underlying β-amino acid scaffold may be modified to allow for regio- and/or stereoselective incorporation of auxiliary molecular functionalities. Auxiliary molecular functionalities may, for example, be incorporated to modulate interaction with LAT1 transporter proteins, e.g., efficacy of translocation through biological membranes (binding to the LAT1-transporter protein and capacity of LAT1-mediated transport), aid the modulation of physiochemical parameter, or to modulate the activity of the physiologically active N-mustard moiety, e.g., cytotoxicity.
In certain embodiments, the underlying aryl-ring may be modified to allow for regioselective incorporation of functional groups that can be converted to chemotherapeutic moieties by using reagents, methods, and protocols well known in the art.
In certain embodiments, the underlying aryl-ring may be modified to allow for regio- and/or stereoselective incorporation of auxiliary molecular functionalities into the arene scaffold. Auxiliary molecular functionalities may, for example, be incorporated to modulate interaction with LAT1 transporter proteins, e.g., efficacy of translocation through biological membranes (binding to the LAT1-transporter protein and capacity of LAT1-mediated transport), or to modulate the activity of the physiologically active chemotherapeutic moiety, e.g., cytotoxicity.

Referring to Scheme 2, conversion of the primary amino group as in compounds of Formula (B) to the N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) amino group (N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethylation)) as in compounds of Formula (C) may be accomplished by reacting compounds of Formula (B) in suitable solvents such water with an excess of about 2-5 equivalents of a suitable 2-halogeno ethanol derivative, e.g., 2-chloroethanol (ClCH2CH2OH) or 2-bromoethanol (BrCH2CH2OH), and about 2.0 equivalents of a suitable inorganic base such as sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), or calcium carbonate (CaCO3) at about reflux temperature for about 8-24 hours. Optionally, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount (about 10 mol-%) of potassium iodide (KI) (Palmer, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33(1), 112-121; Coggiola, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2005, 15(15), 3551-3554; Verny and Nicolas, J. Label. Cmpds Radiopharm., 1988, 25(9), 949-955; and Lin, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2011, 21(3), 940-943).
Referring to Scheme 3, in certain embodiments electron-deficient aryl halides of Formula (D), activated with strongly electron withdrawing substituents for nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions (SNAr) at the aryl ring, may be useful starting materials for incorporating N,N-bis-(2-functionalized) ethyl amino groups as in compounds of Formula (E) where the corresponding N,N-bis-(2-functionalized)ethyl amino groups are N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) amino groups. Commonly used leaving groups (—X) for SNAr-reactions include halogeno, e.g., fluoro (—F), chloro (—Cl), bromo (—Br), with accessory activating groups at the 2- or 4-position relative to the leaving group (ortho- or para-positions). Such groups decrease the electron density in the arene ring and increase the susceptibility to nucleophilic attack and displacement of the leaving group (—X). Examples of activating, strongly electron-withdrawing groups (EWG), include trifluoromethyl (—CF3), cyano (—CN), nitro (—NO2), amide (—CON(R10)2), and formyl (—CHO).
Useful secondary amines for the introduction of the N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) amino functionality include diethanolamine (HN(CH2CH2OH)2), protected diethanolamine derivatives, e.g., O-benzylether protected diethanolamine (HN(CH2CH2OBn)2), or precursors of the putative N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amino group, e.g., 3-pyrroline. Employing O-benzylether protected diethanolamine (HN(CH2CH2OBn)2) or 3-pyrroline necessitates conversion of the corresponding intermediate substitution products to compounds of Formula (E) bearing the target N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amino groups using methods well known in the art.
Referring to Scheme 3, in certain embodiments R1 and/or R5, R10, R20, the linker L, the protecting group PG, and Q, the electron withdrawing group (EWG), the leaving group (—X), and the secondary amine HNR2 are defined as described herein; R1 and/or R5 may also represent an electron withdrawing group (EWG); one or more of R2, R3, and R4 in compounds of Formula (G) or of Formula (H) is a suitable leaving group (—X)), one or more of R2, R3, and R4 is a electron withdrawing group (EWG) preferably in 2- or 4-position relative to the leaving group X; each of the other remaining R2, R3, and R4 is hydrogen; each of R7 and R8 is hydrogen.
Referring to Scheme 3, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino derivatives as in compounds of Formula (E) may be prepared through nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions (SNAr) of aromatic halides of Formula (D) activated by electron withdrawing groups (EWGs), by reaction with an excess of about 1.5-5 equivalents of the neat amine, e.g., HN(CH2CH2OH)2, HN(CH2CH2OBn)2, or 3-pyrroline, (weakly basic reaction conditions) or solutions of the secondary amine in polar aprotic anhydrous solvents, e.g., anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), acetonitrile (MeCN), 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), or mixtures of the foregoing at a temperature from about 80-200° C. (sealed tube), for about 1-12 hours to provide N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino-functionalized compounds of Formula (E). The reaction may also be carried out in the presence of a catalyst, e.g., copper powder (about 10 mol-%) (Atwell, et al., J. Med. Chem., 2007, 50(6), 1197-1212; Palmer, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1994, 37, 2175-2184; Palmer, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1992, 35(17), 3214-3222; Palmer, et al., J. Med. Chem, 1990, 33(1), 112-121; Davies, et al., J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48(16), 5321-5328; Jordan, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2002, 10(8), 2625-2633; Dheyongera, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2005, 13(3), 689-698; Lin, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2011, 21(3), 940-943; and Ferlin, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2004, 12(4), 771-777).
Referring to Scheme 3, methods to convert the N,N-bis-(2-benzyloxyethyl)amino group to a N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amino group include, for example, catalytic hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether groups using heterogeneous catalysts, e.g., 5-10% Pd on carbon (Pd/C) or Raney®-Nickel under standard hydrogenation reaction conditions are known in the art (Vincent and Prunet, Tetrahedron Lett, 2006, 47(24), 4075-4077).
Referring to Scheme 3, conversion the 3-pyrroline ring of the N-aryl-3-pyrroline moiety to a N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amino group as in compounds of Formula (E) include oxidative cleavage of the C═C-double with the Lemieux-Johnson reagent (osmium tetroxide/sodium periodate, OsO4/NaIO4) or by ozonolysis with an O3/O2-gas mixture. Reductive work-up, e.g., with borane-dimethylsulfide complex (BH3.Me2S), triphenylphosphine (Ph3P), thiourea (C(═S)(NH2)2), or zinc dust, yields intermediate N,N-bis(2-oxoethyl)amino groups which may subsequently be reduced to the desired N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amino group as in compounds of Formula (E) with suitable reducing reagents, e.g., borane-THF complex (BH3.THF), or sodium borohydride (NaBH4), under standard reaction conditions(Palmer and Denny, Synth. Commun., 1987, 17(5), 601-610).
In general, the biological activity of nitrogen mustards is based upon the presence of a N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl) functionality. The chemotherapeutic and cytotoxic effects are directly associated with the alkylation of DNA due to the strong electrophilic character of the N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl) functionality. Formation of covalent linkages including interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) is highly cytotoxic and involves the disruption of fundamental cellular processes including DNA replication leading to cellular death.
Many methods and reagents for converting primary alcohols to primary alkyl chlorides including conversion of N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino groups to N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)amino groups are known in the art. The most common methods include the use of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) and various inorganic chlorides of sulfur or phosphorus which are used either in neat form or as solutions in inert solvents such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, or polar non-protic solvents, at room temperature or at elevated temperatures. Other useful chlorination methods and reagents include, for example, combinations of triphenyl phosphine and trichloroacetonitrile (Ph3P/Cl3CCN), triphenylphosphine dichloride (Ph3PCl2) (prepared from Ph3P and Cl2), trimethylsilylchloride and bismuth(III) trichloride (Me3SiCl/BiCl3), mixtures of Ph3P and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), or methanesulfonyl chloride (MeSO2Cl) in pyridine at elevated temperatures.

Referring to Scheme 4, in certain embodiments R1 and/or R5, R20, the linker L, E, the protecting groups PG and Q are defined as described herein; one of R2, R3, and R4 in compounds of Formula (F) is a -E-N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino group (-E-N(CH2—CH2—OH)2); each of the other remaining R2, R3, and R4 is hydrogen; and each of R7 and R8 is hydrogen.
Referring to Scheme 4, in some embodiments N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) compounds of Formula (F) may be reacted with an excess of about 2-15 equivalents of thionyl chloride (SOCl2) either in neat form or as a solution in an anhydrous organic solvent, e.g., dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CHCl3), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), benzene, or mixtures of any of the foregoing at temperatures from about 0° C. (ice bath) −40° C. or heated at reflux for about 0.5-3 hours to provide compounds of Formula (M) or of Formula (N) (Palmer, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33(1), 112-121; Jordan, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2002, 10(8), 2625-2633; Abela Medici, et al., J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 1997, (20), 2258-2263; Taylor, et al., Chem. Biol. Drug Des., 2007, 70(3), 216-226; Dheyongera, Bioorg. Med.

The reaction may optionally be carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) (10 mol-% to 40 mol-%) or in the presence of a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to facilitate the reaction (Squires, et al., J. Org. Chem., 1975, 40(1), 134-136; and Abela Medici, et al, J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 1997, (20), 2258-2263).
Referring to Scheme 4, in some embodiments N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) compounds of Formula (F) may also be reacted with an excess of about 2-10 equivalents of phosphorus(V)oxychloride (phosphoryl chloride, POCl3) either in neat form or as a solution in an anhydrous organic solvent, e.g., benzene, acetonitrile, pyridine, or mixtures of any of the foregoing at a temperature from about 0° C. (ice bath) to about room temperature. The reaction mixture may also be heated from about 80° C. to about reflux temperature for about 0.5-6 hours to provide compounds of Formula (G) (Palmer, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33(1), 112-121; Feau, et al., Org. Biomolecular Chem., 2009, 7(24), 5259-5270; Valu, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1990, 33(11), 3014-3019; P. G. Baraldini, et al., J. Med., Chem., 2000, 53(14), 2675-2684; Gourdi, et al., J., Med., Chem., 1990, 33(4), 1177-1186; Haines, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1987, 30, 542-547; and Matharu, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2010, 20, 3688-3691).
Referring to Scheme 4, in some embodiments N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) compounds of Formula (F) may also be reacted with an excess of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), optionally in an inert solvent, e.g., dichloromethane (DCM), in the presence of an excess of triphenylphosphine (Ph3P) for about 8-24 hours at about room temperature or at reflux temperature for about 2-6 hours to provide compounds of Formula (G) (Buss, et al., J. Fluorine Chem., 1986, 34(1), 83-114; and Kupczyk-Subotkowska, et al., J. Drug Targeting, 1997, 4(6), 359-370).

Med. Chem., 2002, 10(8), 2625-2633; Abela Medici, et al, J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 1997, (20), 2258-2263; Springer, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1990, 33(2), 677-681; and Larden and Cheung, Tetrahedron Lett., 1996, 37(42), 7581-7582).
Referring to Scheme 5, although halides are common leaving groups in nucleophilic substitution reactions for synthetic purposes, it is often more convenient to use the corresponding alcohols such as the ones found in N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino groups of compounds of Formula (H). Since OH is usually considered a poor leaving group, unless protonated, conversion of a hydroxy group such as in N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino groups of compounds of Formula (H) into reactive ester groups, most commonly sulfonic ester groups, converts the hydroxyl group into a functional group with a higher susceptibility to be displaced by an incoming nucleophile including halogenide ions. The N,N-bis(2-aryl- or (polyfluoro)alkylsulfonyloxy)amino groups of aryl- or (polyfluoro)alkylsulfonates of Formula (I) and similar sulfonic esters are most frequently prepared from N,N-bis(2-hydroxy)amino groups of diols of Formula (H) through reaction with an appropriate aryl- or (polyfluoro)alkyl-sulfonyl chloride or anhydride in the presence of a suitable base, e.g., pyridine (nucleophilic catalyst). Besides aromatic (R40 is (substituted) aryl) sulfonic ester groups, aliphatic (R40 is alkyl) sulfonic ester groups, and, in particular, (poly)fluorinated (R40 is poly-F-alkyl) sulfonic ester groups as still more powerful leaving groups are frequently used for activation.
Referring to Scheme 5, in certain embodiments the R40-group in compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (K) is for example phenyl and the leaving group is phenylsulfonyloxy (PhSO2O), 4-methylphenyl (para-methylphenyl) and the leaving group is tosylate (4-methylphenylsulfonyloxy, TsO), 4-bromophenyl (para-bromophenyl) and the leaving group is brosylate (4-bromophenylsulfonyloxy, BsO), or 4-nitrophenyl (para-nitrophenyl) and the leaving group is nosylate (4-nitrophenylsulfonyloxy, NsO), methyl and the leaving group is mesylate (methanesulfonyloxy, MsO), trifluomethyl and the leaving group is triflate (trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy, TfO), nonafluoro-n-butyl and the leaving group is nonaflate (nonafluorobutanesulfonyloxy), or 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl and the leaving group is tresylate (2,2,2-trifluoroethanesulfonyloxy). In some embodiments, the R40-group of compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (K) is methyl and the leaving group is mesylate (methansulfonyloxy, MsO). In some embodiments, the R40-group of compounds of Formula (I) and of Formula (K) is trifluoromethyl and the leaving group is triflate (trifluoromethansulfonyloxy, TfO).
Referring to Scheme 5, N-mustard-type halides of Formula (J), Formula (K), and Formula (L) containing either (a) a N,N-bis(2-halogenoethyl)amino group (compounds of Formula (J)), (b) a N-(2-halogenoethyl)amino-, N-(2-halogenoethyl)amino-group (compounds of Formula (L) or mixed halogeno N-mustards), or (c) a N-(2-halogenoethyl)amino, N-(2-aryl- or (polyfluoro)alkylsulfonyloxyethyl)amino groups (compounds of Formula (K) or hybrid halogeno sulfonate N-mustards), may be prepared from the corresponding esters of sulfonic acid esters of Formula (P) through reaction with an excess or a near stoichiometric amount of an alkali metal halide (MX, MX′) in suitable protic or non-protic organic solvent at elevated temperature (halo-de-sulfonyloxy substitution)
Referring to Scheme 5, in certain embodiments M in MX or MX′ is an alkali metal cation, e.g., lithium (Li+) and sodium (Na+), X and X′ in MX or MX′ are halide anions, e.g., chloride (Cl−), bromide (Br), and iodide (I−). MX or MX′ are alkali metal halides, e.g., lithium chloride (LiCl), lithium bromide (LiBr), sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium bromide (NaBr), or sodium iodide (NaI). In certain compounds of Formula (J), Formula (K), and Formula (L), X is a halogeno, e.g., chloro (—Cl), bromo (—Br), or iodo (—I) (Palmer, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33(1), 112-121; Palmer, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1994, 37, 2175-2184; Palmer, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39(13), 2518-2528; Davies, et al., J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48(16), 5321-5328; Niculesscu-Duvaz, et al., J. Med. Chem., 2004, 47(10), 2651-2658; Weisz, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1995, 5(24), 2985-2988; Thorn, J. Org.

Lett., 2005, 15(15), 3551-3554).
Referring to Scheme 5, N-(2-halogenoethyl)amino, N-(2-aryl- or alkylsulfonyloxyethyl)amino groups of Formula (K) (hybrid halogeno sulfonate N-mustards) may also be prepared from primary alkyl halides of Formula (J) containing N,N-bis(2-halogenoethyl)amino groups through (a) a halo-de-halogenation (halide exchange reaction) or (b) a metathetical sulfonyloxy de-halogeno substitution reaction with solubilized silver sulfonates AgOSO2R40, wherein R40 is defined as described herein under mild conditions in aprotic organic solvents (Emmons and Ferris, J Am.

Referring to Scheme 5, in certain embodiments N,N-bis(2-(polyfluoro)alkyl- or aryl-sulfonyloxyethyl)amino groups as in compounds of Formula (I) may be converted (halo-de-sulfonyloxy substitution) to N,N-bis(halogenoethyl)amino groups of compounds of Formula (J) by reacting bis-sulfonyl esters of Formula (I) with an excess of a suitable alkali metal halide salt MX, e.g., lithium chloride (LiCl), lithium bromide (LiBr), sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium bromide (NaBr), or sodium iodide (NaI) (4-16 equivalents) in a suitable organic solvent, e.g., N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), acetone, 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone, MEK), 3-methyl-2-butanone (isopropyl methyl ketone, MIPK), acetonitrile (MeCN), methanol (MeOH), tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), or a mixture of any of the foregoing, at room temperature or heated to about 50-150° C. for about 0.5-6 hours to provide compounds of Formula (J).

Reductive N-alkylation is a form of amination/alkylation that involves the reaction of an amino group with a carbonyl group to an amine in the presence of a suitable reducing agent via an intermediate imine or protonated imine. The carbonyl group component is most commonly an aldehyde or ketone functionality, the amino group is most commonly ammonia, a primary or secondary aliphatic amino group, or a primary or secondary aromatic amino group (aniline). For indirect reductive aminations, the intermediate imine may be isolated and reduced with a suitable reducing agent. For direct reductive aminations, the reaction may be carried out simultaneously, with the imine formation and reduction occurring concurrently, typically using reducing agents that are more reactive toward protonated imines than ketones, and that are stable under moderately acidic conditions, e.g., sodium cyanoborohydride (Na(CN)BH3) or sodium triacetoxyborohydride (NaB(OAc)3H.

In general, the biological activity of nitrogen mustards is based upon the presence of an alkylating N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl) functionality. The chemotherapeutic and cytotoxic effects are directly associated with the alkylation of DNA due to the strong electrophilic character of the N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl) functionality. Formation of covalent linkages including interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) is highly cytotoxic and involves the disruption of fundamental cellular processes including DNA replication leading to cellular death.
Because of this property, the nitrogen mustards have been used for a number of years in laboratory investigations and in the clinical treat for malignant growth. Unfortunately, the effective dose of nitrogen mustards is in many cases close to the toxic dose and it is therefore desirable to find a nitrogen mustard or a class of nitrogen mustard type compounds possessing the high carcinolytic activity of the parent compound but having modulated toxicity.
The amide linkage masks the alkylating and toxic properties of the nitrogen mustard moiety so that the total host is not subjected to undesirable toxic effects sometime encountered with nitrogen mustard therapy: the amino acid moiety of the molecule facilitates the selective delivery of the “masked” nitrogen mustard via the amino acid transport mechanism into the tumor cells, where the higher amidase activity of the tumor cell liberates the reactivated nitrogen mustard within itself. Thus in effect it will be possible to obtain maximum effect of the nitrogen mustard on the tumor and minimum toxic effect on the host (U.S. Pat. No. 3,235,594).
Referring to Scheme 8, the amide nitrogen mustards of the present disclosure are prepared by condensing carboxylic acids of Formula (R) wherein E is a carbonyl group (—C(═O)—) or a methylenecarbonyl group (—CH2—C(═O)—) with an appropriately functionalized amine such as HN(CH2—CH2—R9)2 wherein X is chloro (—Cl), bromo (—Br), iodo (—I), or (polyfluoro)alkyl- or aryl sulfonyloxy (—OSO2R40) or combinations thereof, and R40 is defined as described herein, to provide amides of nitrogen mustards of Formula (S).

In certain embodiments, mixtures of the mineral acid with organic solvents may be used. A useful aqueous mineral acid reaction mixture to facilitate global deprotection is, e.g., a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid (˜12 M or ˜37 wt-% HCl) with 1,4-dioxane.

It is within the ability of one skilled in the art to select specific and suitable aqueous mineral acids and reaction conditions for hydrolytic acidic hydrolytic acidic global deprotection of compounds of Formula (T) to provide N-mustard functionalized β-substituted β-amino acid derivatives or N-mustard functionalized β-substituted β-amino acid analogs or carboxylic acid (bio)isosteres of Formula (U).
Referring to Scheme 9, simultaneous global deprotection of compounds of Formula (T) where R20 is an acid labile moiety derived from a carboxylic acid, e.g., CO2tBu, CO2-pentamethylbenzyl, CO2—(4-methoxy)benzyl, or CO2-trityl, and Q is a protected amino group derived from an acid-labile N-protecting group, e.g., N(H)Boc, N(H)trityl, N(H)(4-methoxy)phenyl-diphenylmethyl, or N(H)di-((4-methoxy)phenyl)-phenylmethyl, may also be accomplished by reaction with strong organic acids under anhydrous conditions to liberate free (unprotected)N-mustard functionalized β-substituted β-amino acid derivatives or N-mustard functionalized β-substituted β-amino acid analogs or carboxylic acid (bio)isosteres of Formula (U).
In certain embodiments, strong (organic) acids useful for global deprotection under anhydrous conditions include trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 98 wt-% formic acid (FA), methanesulfonic acid (MeSO3H), 85 wt-% phosphoric acid (H3PO4), 2 M hydrogen chloride (HCl) in diethyl ether (Et2O), 4 M hydrogen chloride (HCl) in 1,4-dioxane, or a saturated solution of HCl in ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (Li, et al., J.

Optionally, 2-5 equivalents of a suitable scavenging agent such as triethysilane (Et3SiH) (TES), triisopropylsilane (iPr3SiH), thioanisole, or 1,2-dithioethane (HSCH2CH2HS) may be added to the reaction mixture to suppress formation of unwanted side reactions and by-products originating, for example, from alkylation of electron-rich aromatic scaffolds or sulfide groups under global deprotection conditions disclosed herein to provide unprotected N-mustard functionalized β-substituted β-amino acid derivatives or unprotected N-mustard functionalized β-substituted β-amino acid analogs or carboxylic acid (bio)isosteres of Formula (U).

Any method known in the art may be used to produce acid addition salts or salts including pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts or salts of compounds of Formula (U) (Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts—Properties, Selection, and Use, Stahl and Wermuth, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2008).
The lyophilization may optionally be conducted in the presence of one or more equivalents of a mineral acid, optionally with a pharmaceutically acceptable counterion, to form (pharmaceutically acceptable) acid addition salts of compounds of Formula (U). For example, one or more equivalents of hydrochloric acid (HCl) may be added prior to lyophiliation to form mono-, di-, or polyhydrochloride salts of compounds of Formula (U) or mixtures thereof.
The lyophilization may optionally be conducted in the presence of one or more equivalents of a base, optionally with a pharmaceutically acceptable counterion, to form (pharmaceutically acceptable) salts of compounds of Formula (U). For example, one or more equivalents of sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) may be added prior to lyophiliation to form mono-, di-, or poly sodium salts of compounds of Formula (U) or mixtures thereof.
A characteristic feature of solid tumours is the presence of cells at very low oxygen concentrations (hypoxia; partial pressure of oxygen in tumorous tissue of 0.05-5.0%) often surrounding areas of necrosis. There are clear links between hypoxia and the lack of response to radiotherapy and intrinsic resistance to cytotoxic therapy. It has also been demonstrated that hypoxia in tumours tends to select for a more malignant phenotype (Wilson and Hay, Nat. Rev. Canc., 2011, 11, 393-410; and Brown and Wilson, Nat. Rev. Canc., 2004, 4, 437-447).
Reductive metabolic processes are more prevalent in the hypoxic environment of solid tumors. Reductive enzyme systems have the ability to reduce certain functional groups. For example, aromatic and aliphatic N-oxides (—N+(O—)R2) are known to be reducible to the corresponding amines (—NR2), and nitro groups (—NO2) can be either reduced to the corresponding amines (—NH2) or to hydroxylamines (—NH(OH) depending on the oxygen saturation of the tissue (Denny, et al., Br. J. Canc., 1996, 74, Suppl. XXVII, S32-S38; and Nagasawa, et al., Biol. Pharm. Bull., 2006, 29(12), 2335-2342).
One promising approach for the design of cancer-cell-selective mustards exploits selective enzymatic reduction of nitroaryl compounds in the oxygen-starved (hypoxic) cells found in solid tumors. N-Oxide derivatives of nitrogen mustards including N-oxides of melphalan (PX-478; Kirkpatrick, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,399,785; Koh, et al., Mol. Canc. Ther., 2008, 7(1), 90-100; www.medkoo.com) and chlorambucil (Kirkatrick, et al., Anti-Cancer Drugs, 1994, 5, 467-472; Tercel, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 1247-1252; and Kirckpatrick, U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,273) have been investigated as bioreductive prodrugs with reduced systemic toxicity in comparison to the parent drugs. Those drugs take advantage of a) the hypoxic nature, and b) the reductive nature, of certain tumorous cells. The N-oxide functional group deactivates the extremely reactive alkylating agent through capture of the lone electron pair of the parent nitrogen mustard moiety thus diminishing the alkylating properties and the off-target toxicities associated with that. Bioreductive activation within the hypoxic tumor environment or milieu by hypoxic cells and their reductive enzyme systems is believed to restore the cytotoxicity of the free nitrogen mustards. The overall effect is an enhanced therapeutic index of the N-oxides of nitrogen mustards relative to their parent nitrogen mustards.
Depending on the pH and the nature of the solvent, particularly aprotic organic solvents, N-oxides of nitrogen mustards are known to intramolecularly rearrange to the corresponding more stable hydroxylamines with markedly less intrinsic cytotoxic potential (Tercel, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 1247-1252; and Kirckpatrick, U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,273). However, it is also known that said hydroxylamines are able to convert back to the parent N-oxides in vivo where the latter can be reduced in the hypoxic and reductive environment of tumorous cells where the underlying nitrogen mustards exerts their cytoxicity.
Referring to Scheme 10, in certain embodiments of compounds of Formula (V), Formula (W), and of Formula (X) R1 and/or R5, R6, R9, and the linker L are defined as described herein; one of R2, R3, and R4 is a N,N-bis-(2-functionalized)ethylamino group (nitrogen mustard group) linked to a connector group “A” (-A-N(CH2—CH2—R9)2) wherein the connector group “A” is a bond (“—”) or a methylene group (—CH2—); each of the remaining R2, R3, and R4 is hydrogen; each of R7 and R8 is hydrogen.
Referring to Scheme 10, N-oxidation of the N-mustard group of compounds of Formula (V) with a slight excess of 3-chloroperbezoic acid (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, mCPBA) in a solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM) at about room temperature followed by work-up with aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate furnishes the more stable hydroxylamine (through putative re-arrangement via a cyclic oxazetidinium species) of Formula (W).
Referring to Scheme 10, N-oxidation of the N-mustard group of compounds of Formula (V) with 3-5 equivalents of peracetic acid (MeCO(O2H)), prepared from 35 wt-% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in glacial acetic acid (HOAc), in a solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM) at about room temperature followed by acid extraction furnishes the corresponding N-oxide of Formula (X).
Characterization
To determine the extent to which compounds provided by the present disclosure enter cells via the LAT1/4F2hc transporter, amino acid uptake assays into cells that are transfected with DNA encoding the LAT1 and 4F2hc subunits may be performed using, for example, HEK (human embryonic kidney) or CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells. Oocytes may also be injected with cRNA LAT1 and 4F2hc to express LAT1/4F2hc transporter. Compounds may be screened either for specificity for the LAT1/4F2hc transporter or for transport into cells endogenously expressing a plurality of transporters. The results of a screening method (e.g., a competition uptake, exchange or direct uptake assay) using a cell expressing the LAT1/4F2hc transporter may be compared with the results of a control cell(s) lacking the LAT1/4F2hc transporter or in the presence of a specific inhibitor of the LAT1/4F2hc transporter.
In competition experiments, the ability of a compound to specifically bind to the LAT1/4F2hc transporter is determined. A known substrate (reference substrate) for the LAT1/4F2hc transporter and a test compound are added to cells expressing the LAT1/4F2hc transporter. For example, gabapentin may be used as a reference because it demonstrates high selectivity for LAT1/4F2hc. Gabapentin is not a substrate for the intestinal amino acid transporters B0,+, ATB0+, and LAT2, whereas gabapentin may be a substrate for the organic cation transporter OCTN2 (Cundy, et al., J Pharm Exp Ther, 2004, 311(1), 315-323; and Grigat, et al., Drug Metabol Disp, 2009, 37(2), 330-337). The amount or rate of transport of the reference substrate in the presence of the test compound is compared to the amount or rate of transport of the reference substrate in the absence of the test compound. If the amount or rate of transport of the reference substrate is decreased by the presence of the test compound, the test compound binds to the LAT1/4F2hc transporter.
Compounds that bind the LAT1/4F2hc transporter can be further analyzed to determine if they are transported by the LAT1/4F2hc transporter or only compete for binding to the transporter. Transport of a compound into a cell can be determined by detecting a signal from within a cell from any of a variety of reporters. The reporter can be as simple as a label such as a fluorophore, a chromophore, a radionuclide, or a reporter can be an agent that is detected utilizing liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS). The same methods of detection can be used to determine if a reporter is transported from the intracellular space to the medium by administering the test compound to the outside of the cell and sampling the media for the presence of the intracellular reporter after a predetermined period of time (exchange assays).
Having determined that a compound is a substrate for LAT1/4F2hc, a further screen may be performed to determine the selectivity of the compound toward other membrane transporters. Selectivity refers to the affinities with which a compound is transported by different transporters. In order to demonstrate selectivity for LAT1/4F2hc, a compound may be tested in uptake and/or competition assays for other transporters. Transporters that could potentially transport LAT1/4F2hc substrates include SLC1A4 (ASCT1; NP_003029), SLC1A5 (ASCT2; NP_005619), SLC6A1 (GAT1; NP_003033), SLC6A5 (GlyT2; NP_004202), SLC6A6(TauT; NP_003034), SLC6A8 (CT1; NP_005620), SLC6A9 (GlyT1; NM_008865), SLC6A11 (GAT3; NP_55044), SLC6A12 (BGT1; NP_003035), SLC6A13 (GAT2; NP_057699), SLC6A14 (ATB0,+; NP_009162), SLC6A15 (B0AT2; NP_001139807), SLC6A17 (XT1; NP_001010898), SLC6A18 (B0AT3; NP_872438), SLC6A19 (B0AT1; NP_001003841), SLC7A6(y+LAT2; NP_001070253), SLC7A7 (y+LAT1; NP_001119577), SLC7A8 (LAT2; NP_036376), SLC7A9 (b0,+AT; NP_055085), SCL7A10 (ASC-1; NP_062823), SLC15A1(PepT1; NP_005064), SLC15A2 (PepT2; NP_066568), SLC16A1 (MCT1; NP_003042), SLC16A2 (MCT8; NP_006508), SLC16A10 (TAT1; NP_061063), SLCO1B1 (OATP1B1; NP_006437), SLCO1B3 (OATP1B3; NP_062818), SLC22A1 (OCT1; NP_003048), SLC22A2 (OCT2; NP_003049), SLC22A4 (OCTN1; NP_003050), SLC22A5 (OCTN2; NP_003051), SLC22A8 (OAT3; NP_004245), SLC36A1 (PAT1; NP_510968), SLC36A1 (PAT1; NP_510968), SLC36A2 (PAT2; NP_861441), SLC38A1 (SNAT1; NP_109599), SLC38A2 (SNAT2; NP_061849), SLC38A3 (SNAT3; NP_006832), SLC38A4 (SNAT4; NP_060488), SLC38A5 (SNAT5; NP_0277053), SLC43A1 (LAT3; NP_003618), and SLC43A2 (LAT4; NP_689559).
Human genes required for functional expression of a transporter of interest may be cloned using PCR, fully sequenced, and subcloned into plasmids that can be used for expression in mammalian cells or Xenopus laevis oocytes. Unless otherwise noted, all subunits of a transporter of interest are co-expressed in each heterologous system described in the examples. Because many mammalian cell lines exhibit high levels of amino acid transport activity, expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes can be advantageous due to the low levels of endogenous amino acid transport. To assess transport function of a specific transporter protein, it can be desirable to clone the cDNA and express the protein in cells that have low endogenous transport activity. Competition assays may be performed with labeled compounds that are optimal substrates (reference substrates) for the transporter of interest. Typically, uptake levels of a test compound are compared to uptake of a reference substrate for the transporter of interest.
Compounds of Formula (1) are substrates for LAT1/4F2hc and have a Vmax of at least 10%, 20%, and in certain embodiments, at least 50% that of gabapentin. Concomitantly, the compounds have a low affinity toward amino acid transporters of system A, system N, system ASC, and the system L transporter LAT2/4F2hc.
Biodistribution studies with normal and tumor-bearing rats may be used to determine the disposition of actively transported compounds and the selectivity of substrate accumulation in tissue that expresses the LAT1/4F2hc transporter compared with other tissue. Imaging techniques can qualitatively and quantitatively elucidate the role of transport proteins in drug disposition, for example, whole body autoradiography (WBA). WBA allows both the visualization and the quantification of radionuclide-labeled compound levels in a thin section of the whole animal. Information obtained using WBA is analogous to data obtained from diagnostic imaging, albeit at a single point in time.

The residue is diluted with 1.0 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and the aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (3×). The combined organic extracts are washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3), and brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) or sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to yield the target compound, which may be used directly in the next step. Alternatively, the crude residue may be further purified by silica gel column chromatography using EtOAc, methanol (MeOH), dichloromethane (DCM), and hexanes, or mixtures of any of the foregoing to furnish the purified target compound. Alternatively, the crude target compound may be further purified by re-crystallization.

LAT1 Uptake Inhibition Assays
The ability of compounds to interact with LAT1 was measured using a radiolabeled competition uptake assay with [3H]-Gabapentin (GP) in 96-well plates with LLCPK cells conditionally expressing hLAT1. 5×104 cells/well were plated in white, clear bottom plates in the presence or absence of tetracycline or doxcycline to induce hLAT1 expression. The next day, cells were treated with butyrate to stimulate additional hLAT1 expression. On the third day, the cells were washed and then incubated with 50,000 cpm of [3H]-GP in PBS in the presence or absence of 1 mM of test compound in at least triplicate for 15 min. At end of the assay time, the incubation solution was removed, and the plates were washed three times with 100 μl of ice-cold PBS. 150 μl of scintillation fluid was added to each well, and the radioactivity retained within the cells was measured on a 96-well scintillation counter. The data are expressed as a percent of specific [3H]-GP uptake. Unlabeled GP and other large amino acids (phenylalanine and leucine) were used as controls.
The ability of various compounds to interact with LAT1 was assessed by measuring the inhibition of [3H]-GP uptake into LAT1-expressing cells in the presence of 1 mM test compound. Unlabeled GP and phenylalanine (Phe) and leucine (Leu) were used as controls. After incubation for 15 min, cells were washed, scintillation fluid added, and cell-bound radioactivity determined in a scintillation counter. Data are expressed as a percent of specific GP uptake.
The specific uptake of radiolabeled gabapentin into LAT1-expressing cells was inhibited by 1 mM of unlabeled gabapentin, phenylalanine, leucine, and the compounds of Examples 1-4. Treatment with gabapentin, phenylalanine, leucine, and the compound of Example 3 resulted in specific uptake of less than 10%. The compounds of Examples 1, 2, and 4 resulted in specific uptake of greater than 20% but less than 50% at this concentration.

LAT1-Specific In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assays
The LAT1-specific in vitro cytotoxicity of compounds was assessed by using a modified clonigenic assay in 96-well plates with LLCPK cells conditionally expressing hLAT1. 1000 cells/well were plated in clear bottom plates in the presence or absence of tetracycline or doxcycline to induce hLAT1 expression. The next day, cells were treated with butyrate to stimulate additional hLAT1 expression. On the third day, cells were washed and incubated with various concentrations of test compounds in PBS buffer in at least quadruplicate for 30 minutes. At the end of the treatment, test compounds were removed and growth media was added to the cells. Clonal populations were allowed to grow until the control wells (mock treatment) were near confluency (7 to 10 days). Cell growth was quantified by fixing and staining the cells post-wash with crystal violent in glutaraldehye, washing away unadhered dye, solubilizing the stained cells in acetic acid and monitoring absorbance at 530 nm. Data from each test concentration were expressed as the percent of live, mock-treated controls (% surviving cells). LAT1 specificity was determined by the differential toxicity in cells induced (LAT1+) vs. non-induced (no LAT1) to express hLAT1. Melphalan, a N-mustard compound, was used as a control.
The LAT1-specific cytotoxicity of various compounds was assessed by treating cells expressing or not expressing LAT1 with 3 μM of test compound for 30 min. Melphalan was used as a control compound. Following treatment, cells were washed and growth media was added. Surviving cells were allowed to proliferate for 7-10 days, and then stained and quantified. Results were expressed as the percent of untreated cells (% surviving cells).
The percent surviving cells for melphalan and the compound of Example 2 was about the same in cells expressing LAT1 and in cells not expressing LAT1. The percent surviving cells for the compounds of Examples 1, 3, and 4 was significantly reduced by at least 25% in cells expressing LAT1 compared to cells not expressing LAT1.
The in vitro cytotoxicity of the two enatiomers of QBS10072 was assessed by treating LAT1-expressing cells with various concentrations of the S (solid circles) or the R (open circles) isomer for 30 min. Following treatment, cells were washed and growth media was added. Surviving cells were allowed to proliferate for 7-10 days, and then stained and quantified. Results were expressed as the percent of untreated cells (% surviving cells) and graphed vs. test concentration.
The in vitro cytotoxicity of the two single enantiomers of Example 3 was assessed by treating LAT1-expressing cells with various concentrations of the S (solid circles) or the R (open circles) isomer for 30 min. Following treatment, cells were washed and growth media was added. Surviving cells were allowed to proliferate for 7-10 days, and then stained and quantified. Results were expressed as the percent of untreated cells (% surviving cells) and graphed vs. test concentration.
