BACKGROUND
The invention relates to intermediates useful in the synthesis of pharmaceutically active macrolide compounds and methods of synthesizing macrolide compounds. Halichondrin B is a potent anticancer agent originally isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai, and subsequently found in Axinella sp., Phakellia carteri, and Lissodendoryx sp. A total synthesis of halichondrin B was published in 1992 (Aicher, T. D. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114:3162-3164). Eribulin mesylate (also called Halaven®, E7389, and the mesylate salt of B1939), a nontaxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor, is a structurally simplified, synthetic analogue of halichondrin B. Methods and intermediates for the synthesis of eribulin mesylate and other halichondrin B analogues are described in International Publication Nos. WO 2005/118565, WO 2009/046308, WO 2009/064029, and WO 2009/124237; U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,865; Austad et al., Synlett 24(3):333-337, 2013; Austad et al., Synlett. 24(3):327-332, 2013; and Chase et al., Synlett 24(3):323-326, 2013; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. New methods for the synthesis of halichondrin B analogs, in particular eribulin, are desirable.

Compounds useful in the invention may be isotopically labeled compounds. Useful isotopes include hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (e.g., 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, and 17O). Isotopically-labeled compounds can be prepared by synthesizing a compound using a readily available isotopically-labeled reagent in place of a non-isotopically-labeled reagent.
For any of the following chemical definitions, a number following an atomic symbol indicates that total number of atoms of that element that are present in a particular chemical moiety. As will be understood, other atoms, such as hydrogen atoms, or substituent groups, as described herein, may be present, as necessary, to satisfy the valences of the atoms. For example, an unsubstituted C2 alkyl group has the formula —CH2CH3. When used with the groups defined herein, a reference to the number of carbon atoms includes the divalent carbon in acetal and ketal groups but does not include the carbonyl carbon in acyl, ester, carbonate, or carbamate groups. A reference to the number of oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atoms in a heteroaryl group only includes those atoms that form a part of a heterocyclic ring.
By “acetal” is meant —O—(CHR)—O—, where R is H, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted arylalkyl.
By “acyl” is meant —C(O)R, where R is H, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, or arylalkyl. In exemplary acyl groups, R is H, C1-12 alkyl (e.g., C1-8, C1-6, C1-4, C2-7, C3-12, or C3-6 alkyl), C2-12 alkenyl (e.g., C2-8, C2-6, C2-4, C3-12, or C3-6 alkenyl), C6-20 aryl (e.g., C6-15, C6-10, C8-20, or C8-15 aryl), monocyclic C1-6 heteroaryl (e.g., monocyclic C1-4 or C2-6 heteroaryl), C4-19 heteroaryl (e.g., C4-10 heteroaryl), (C6-15)aryl(C1-6)alkyl, (C1-6)heteroaryl(C1-6)alkyl, or (C4-19)heteroaryl(C1-6)alkyl. As defined herein, any heteroaryl group present in an acyl group has from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected independently from O, N, and S. An acyl group can be unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., optionally substituted acyl). In the optionally substituted acyl group, the substituent R is H, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted arylalkyl.
By “acylating agent” is meant a compound that reacts with an amine or a hydroxyl group to produce an amide or an ester, respectively. An acylating agent has a formula R-LG, where R is acyl, and LG is halogen, carbonate, or —OR′, where R′ is acyl.
By “alkoxide” is meant an anionic compound RO−, where R is alkyl. A counterion for alkoxide can be an alkali metal cation, an alkali earth metal cation, or a tetraalkylammonium cation. Alkoxide can be optionally substituted in the same manner as alkyl.

The present invention provides methods for the synthesis of eribulin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (e.g., eribulin mesylate) through a macrocyclizations. The macrocyclizations of the present invention involve subjecting a non-macrocyclic intermediate to a carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction (e.g., catalytic Ring-Closing Olefin Metathesis, an olefination reaction (e.g., Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons olefination), Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi reaction, or Dieckmann reaction) to afford a macrocyclic intermediate (e.g., a compound of formula (IB), (IIB), (IIIB), (IVB), (VB), or (VIB)). The carbon-carbon bond forming reaction provides a C.0-C.1, C.2-C.3, C.3-C.4, C.15-C.16, C.19-C.20, or C.26-C.27 bond in the structure of eribulin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The carbon-atom numbering scheme for eribulin and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof is shown in Chart 1.
The invention also provides intermediates in the synthesis of eribulin and methods of preparing the same, as described herein.

The general synthetic sequence including RCM that can be used to prepare eribulin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (e.g., a mesylate salt) is shown in FIG. 1 . As shown in FIG. 1 , the non-macrocyclic intermediate in the synthesis of eribulin can be a compound of formula (IA):

The catalysts that can be used to convert the compound of formula (IA) to the compound of formula (IB) can be those known in the art. Olefin metathesis catalysts include Ru-carbene complexes (e.g., Grubbs and Hoveyda-Grubbs catalysts).
The compound of formula (IB) can be reacted with a hydroxyl protecting group removing agent and, optionally, an oxidizing agent (e.g., when R8 is H in the compound of formula (IB)) capable of converting an alcohol to a carbonyl group (e.g., capable of converting an allylic alcohol to an enone) to afford the compound of formula (IC):
where P1, P2, P3, and X are as defined for compound of formula (IB).
The hydroxyl protecting group removing agent used in the step forming the compound of formula (IC) can be a Brønsted acid (e.g., a carboxylic acid, such as a carboxylic acid having a pKa of 4±1).
The compound of formula (ID) can be prepared from the compound of formula (IC) by a synthesis involving reacting the compound of formula (IC) with a 1,4-reducing agent to afford a compound of formula (ID):

Oxidation of the —(CH(OH))— in the compound of formula (IIIB) to give the compound of formula (IIIB), in which X3 is oxo, can be performed using methods known in the art for oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl groups, e.g., by contacting the compound of formula (IIIB) with an oxidizing agent capable of converting an alcohol to a carbonyl group.

For example, a hydroxyl protecting group removing agent, such as a fluoride source (e.g., TBAF), can mediate the isomerization of a β,γ-enone to an α,β-enone, while unmasking hydroxyl groups protected with optionally substituted silyl groups.
The compound of formula (ID) (in which X is O, P1 and P2 are H, and both P3 groups and X2, together with the atoms to which each is attached, combine to form ketal) can be aminated to afford eribulin, as described herein. Alternatively, the compound of formula (ID) (in which P1 is H, X and P2 combine to form a masked amino, and both P3 groups and X2, together with the atoms to which each is attached, combine to form ketal) can be reacted with an amino unmasking agent to afford eribulin, as described herein. Eribulin mesylate can be produced by salification of eribulin, as described herein.

In some embodiments, the preparation of the compound of formula (IIIA) from the compound of formula (IIIC) involves allylating the compound of formula (IIIC) (e.g., the compound of formula (IIIC), in which R4 is H, and X3 is oxo, or X3 and R4 combine with the carbon atom to which they are attached to form a thioacetal). Allylation of the compound of formula (IIIC) can be performed using conditions known in the art. In a non-limiting example, when X3 is oxo, and R4 is H, allylation of the compound of formula (IIIC) can be a nucleophilic allylation (e.g., by contacting the compound of formula (IIIC) with a nucleophilic allylating agent (e.g., allylboron reagent (e.g., allyl boronate or allyl borane), allylstannane, allyl Grignard reagent, allylsilane, or allyl indium). Alternatively, allylation of the compound of formula (IIIC) can be performed using electrophilic allylation (e.g., when X3 and R4 combine with the carbon to which they are attached to form a thioacetal). In a non-limiting examples of electrophilic allylation, the compound of formula (IIIC), in which X3 and R4 combine with the carbon to which they are attached to form a thioacetal, can be contacted with a strong base followed by an allylic electrophile (e.g., allyl halide or allyl sulfonate).
The preparation of the compound of formula (IIIA) from the compound of formula (IIIC) can also involve reducing the compound of formula (IIIC), in which X3 is oxo and R4 is OP6, with a 1,2-reducing agent to afford a compound of formula (IIIC), in which X3 is oxo or —(CH(OH))—, and R4 is H. Formation of the compound of formula (IIIC), in which X3 is oxo, and R4 is H, can be direct (e.g., by treating with DIBAL at a temperature between about −70° C. and about −80° C.) or indirect via the compound of formula (IIIC), in which X3 combines with the carbon atom to which it is attached to form —(CH(OH))—, and R4 is H. The indirect route to the compound of formula (IIIC), in which X3 is oxo, and R4 is H, thus involves first reducing the compound of formula (IIIC), in which X3 is oxo, and R4 is OP6, with a 1,2-reducing agent to give the compound of formula (IIIC), in which X3 combines with the carbon atom to which it is attached to form —(CH(OH))—, and R4 is H. The latter compound can be reacted with an oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing an alcohol to a carbonyl group to furnish the compound of formula (IIIC), in which X3 is oxo, and R4 is H.
Throughout the oxidation, reduction, and allylation reactions described above, the sensitive functional groups present in the compound of formula (IIIC) can be protected (e.g., R1 and each P3 is independently a hydroxyl protecting group) or can be present in an unreactive form (e.g., both P3 groups and X2, together with the atoms to which each is attached, combine to form ketal).

In yet another non-limiting example, C.35 hydroxyl in the compound of formula (IC) (e.g., a compound of formula (IC) in which P1 is a hydroxyl protecting group, and X and P2 combine to form optionally masked amino) can be reacted with a hydroxyl protecting group removing agent to afford eribulin (when X and P2 combine to form unmasked amino) or, when X and P2 combine to form a masked amino, either before or after the treatment with the hydroxyl protecting group removing agent, the compound of formula (IC) can be reacted with an amino unmasking agent to afford eribulin. Amino unmasking agents are further described herein. The amination reaction can provide a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of eribulin directly. Alternatively, the amination reaction can provide eribulin in a free base form. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt of eribulin can be prepared from eribulin through a salification reaction as described herein.
Salification
Salification reaction conditions are known in the art. Salification of eribulin can afford a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of eribulin (e.g., eribulin mesylate). In particular, salification reaction can involve contacting eribulin with a Brønsted acid (e.g., a pharmaceutically acceptable Brønsted acid (e.g., methanesulfonic acid)) to afford a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of eribulin (e.g., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, ed.: Stahl and Wermuth, Wiley-VCH/VHCA, Weinheim/Zurich, 2002). Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of eribulin, e.g., eribulin mesylate, can be formed by methods known in the art, e.g., in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compound or separately by reacting the free base group with a suitable organic acid. In one example, eribulin is treated with a solution of MsOH and NH4OH in water and acetonitrile. The mixture is concentrated. The residue is dissolved in DCM-pentane, and the solution is added to anhydrous pentane. The resulting precipitate is filtered and dried under high vacuum to provide eribulin mesylate
Oxidizing Agents Capable of Converting an Alcohol to a Carbonyl Group
Oxidizing agents capable of converting an alcohol to a carbonyl group are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of these oxidizing agents include Dess-Martin periodinane, TEMPO (in the presence of bleach or BAIB), a dimethylsulfonium compound (e.g., dimethylchlorosulfonium chloride), aluminum trialkoxide with an excess of a ketone (e.g., acetone), and catalytic tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP) (in the presence of N-methylmorpholine oxide). The dimethylsulfonium compound can be prepared in situ under the conditions known for Parikh-Doering oxidation, Swern oxidation, Corey-Kim oxidation, or Pfitzner-Moffatt oxidation. An oxidation reaction of an alcohol to a carbonyl group (e.g., a ketone) can be performed using aluminum trialkoxide and an excess of a ketone (e.g., acetone) under the conditions known in the art for Oppenauer oxidation. Allylic and benzylic alcohols can also be oxidized with MnO2.
Reducing Agents
Reducing agents that can be used in the methods of the invention are those known in the art. A reducing agent can be an electron-transfer reducing agent, a metal hydride, or a metalloid hydride. Non-limiting examples of electron-transfer reducing agent include alkali metals in oxidation state (0), alkali earth metals in oxidation state (0), alkali arenides, lanthanide (II) salts (e.g., SmI2), Zn(0), Fe(0), and Mn(0). Non-limiting examples of metal hydrides and metalloid hydrides include boron hydride compounds (e.g., NaBH4, LiBH4, LiB(Et)3H, selectrides (e.g., L-selectride), and boranes (e.g., 9-BBN and alpine borane)), aluminum hydride compounds (e.g., LiAlH4, Red-Al®, and alanes (e.g., DIBAL)), hydrosilanes (e.g., PMHS and Ph2SiH2), hydrostannanes (e.g., Bu3SnH), copper hydride complexes (e.g., Stryker's reagent), palladium hydride complexes, platinum hydride complexes, iridium hydride complexes, rhodium hydride complexes, and ruthenium hydride complexes. Reducing agents can be formed in situ, e.g., a copper hydride complex can be formed by a reaction of a copper salt with, e.g., a boron hydride compound or a hydrosilane. Thus, some reducing reagents (e.g., boron hydride compounds, hydrosilanes, and hydrostannanes) can be used in combination with a catalytic quantity of a metal salt (e.g., Cu, Pd, Pt, Ir, Rh, or Ru salt). Alternatively, catalytic reducing agents can be metal salts (e.g., aluminum isopropoxide or a ruthenium complex) in combination with an alcohol, which undergo transfer hydrogenation of carbonyl-containing compounds without intermediacy of a metal hydride. Non-limiting examples of transfer hydrogenation reactions include Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction (e.g., using aluminum isopropoxide/isopropanol) and Ru-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation (e.g., Hashiguchi et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 117:7562-7563, 1995).
When a substrate is an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (e.g., an α,β-enone), a reducing agent can be a 1,2-reducing agent or a 1,4-reducing agent. For example, a reaction between an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound and a 1,2-reducing agent can afford, e.g., an allylic alcohol (or an allylic amine, if the starting compound is an enamide), whereas a reaction between an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound and a 1,4-reducing agent can afford an α,β-saturated compound and can leave the carbonyl group intact after work up of the reaction mixture. Non-limiting examples of 1,2-reducing agents include metal hydrides and metalloid hydrides, e.g., aluminum hydride compounds, boron hydride compounds (e.g., CeCl3 with NaBH4), and ruthenium hydride complexes. Non-limiting examples of 1,4-reducing agents include boron hydride compounds, hydrostannanes, copper hydride complexes (e.g., Stryker's reagent), palladium hydride complexes, platinum hydride complexes, iridium hydride complexes, rhodium hydride complexes, and ruthenium hydride complexes.
A compound having an allylic leaving group (e.g., a carboxylate, a halide, or a sulfonate) can be treated with an allylic reducing agent to replace the leaving group with a hydrogen atom. A non-limiting example of allylic reducing agent is a palladium salt in combination with a formic acid salt (e.g., trialkylammonium formate).
Masked Amines and Amine Unmasking Agents
The compounds used in the methods of the invention can contain a masked or unmasked amine (e.g., at C.35 carbon of the structure of eribulin). An unmasked amine is —NH2. Amine can be masked using methods known in the art, e.g., by protecting amine with an N-protecting group. Alternatively, amine can be masked as a nitrogen-containing moiety, which can be reacted with an amine unmasking agent to afford an amine. Non-limiting examples of the nitrogen-containing moieties include azide, an imide (e.g., phathalimide), Amine unmasking agents can be those known in the art for removing N-protecting groups from amines. In a non-limiting example, a Boc group can be removed using amine unmasking agents known in the art, e.g., a Brønsted acid (e.g., HCl in 1,4-dioxane or trifluoroacetic acid). When amine is masked as azide, the amine can be unmasked by subjecting the compound containing the masked amine to Staudinger reaction conditions (e.g., by contacting with a phosphine, such as trialkylphosphine, dialkylarylphosphine, alkyldiarylphosphine, or triarylphosphine) or by reacting the compound containing the masked amine with a reducing agent (e.g., LiAlH4). When amine is masked as an imide (e.g., phthalimide), the amine can be unmasked by reacting with an amine unmasking agent known in the art, e.g., hydrazine.
Hydroxyl Protecting Groups and Hydroxyl Protecting Group Removing Agents
Hydroxyl protecting groups can be as defined herein. In particular, a hydroxyl protecting group can be an acyl, a sulfonyl, an arylalkyl (e.g., benzyl or p-methoxybenzyl), an aryl (e.g., p-methoxyphenyl), or an optionally substituted silyl (e.g., TMS, TES, TBS, TIPS, TBDPS, or TPS). Hydroxyl protecting groups, hydroxyl protecting agents, and hydroxyl protecting reaction conditions can be selected to protect selectively certain hydroxyl groups in a compound, while leaving other hydroxyl groups unprotected. The choice of hydroxyl protecting groups for a compound can facilitate subsequent deprotection strategies, as some hydroxyl protecting groups can be removed in the presence of others using appropriate hydroxyl protecting group removing agents. Some of these strategies involving the choice of silyl hydroxyl protecting groups are discussed in, e.g., Silicon-Based Blocking Agents, Gelest, Inc., 2011.
Hydroxyl protecting group removing agents are those agents that can react with a compound having a protected hydroxyl group to afford the compound with a deprotected hydroxyl group. Hydroxyl protecting group removing agents and deprotection reaction conditions can be those known in the art. In a non-limiting example, hydroxyl masked as silyl ether can be unmasked by a reaction with a fluoride source (e.g., a fluoride salt, such as KF or TBAF). Alternatively, hydroxyl protected as TMS or TES ether can be deprotected by a reaction with a Brønsted acid (e.g., a carboxylic acid). In another non-limiting example, hydroxyl protected as an ester can be deprotected by a reaction with a C1-6 alkoxide (e.g., alkali C1-6 alkoxide or alkali earth C1-6 alkoxide). In yet another non-limiting example, hydroxyl protected as an arylalkyl ether (e.g., 1-arylalk-1-yl ether) can be deprotected using a reduction reaction, e.g., with Pd/C and H2 or with Na/NH3. Alternatively, hydroxyl protected as an alkoxy-arylalkyl ether (e.g., MPM ether) can be deprotected by a reaction with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ). In still another non-limiting example, hydroxyl protected as alkoxyalkyl ether (e.g., 1-alkoxyalk-1-yl) or THP ether can be deprotected by a reaction with a Brønsted acid. Cyclic protected diols, such as acetals or ketals (e.g., as 2-alkyl-1,3-dioxolane, 2,2-dialkyl-1,3-dioxolane, 2-alkyl-1,3-dioxane, or 2,2-dialkyl-1,3-dioxane), can be deprotected by a reaction with a Brønsted acid (e.g., a carboxylic acid).
Dihydroxylation and Oxidative Carbon-Carbon Bond Cleavage
Dihydroxylation reaction produces diols from olefins. The reaction conditions can be those known in the art. Dihydroxylation reaction may be direct (e.g., Sharpless dihydroxylation, Upjohn dihydroxylation, or Milas dihydroxylation) or indirect (e.g., through epoxidation/hydrolysis, diborylation/oxidation, or carboxylation/hydrolysis (e.g., Woodward reaction or Prévost reaction)). A direct dihydroxylation reaction can be performed using an osmium complex (e.g., OsO4 or osmate salt). A catalytic quantity of the osmium complex can be used in the dihydroxylation reactions in combination with an additional oxidizing agent (e.g., N-methylmorpholine N-oxide or hydrogen peroxide). The dihydroxylation reaction can be rendered stereoselective by including a chiral ligand (e.g., in AD-mix, which is a mixture of osmate and a chiral ligand).
When a dihydroxylation reaction is performed with an osmium complex and a periodate salt as oxidizing agent, the carbon-carbon double bond of an olefin can be cleaved to afford two carbonyl groups. The transformation of an olefin to two carbonyl groups is referred to herein as a cleavage reaction. Cleavage reaction conditions can be those known in the art. Non-limiting examples of cleavage reaction conditions can be ozonolysis reaction conditions or a reaction with an osmium complex (e.g., OsO4 or osmate salt) and a periodate salt. A vicinal diol can be cleaved by sodium periodate or potassium permanganate.
Epimerizations
Epimerization reactions can be used to invert a stereogenic center having an undesired stereochemical identity. For example, through epimerization, R stereogenic center can be converted to S stereogenic center and vice versa. Epimerization of a stereogenic sp3-carbon bonded to one hydrogen atom and to one hydroxyl group can be achieved through a reaction sequence involving oxidation of the hydroxyl group to a carbonyl group followed by a 1,2-reduction reaction. The 1,2-reduction reaction can provide the desired stereochemical identity diastereoselectively, or the reaction can be carried out using a chiral catalyst, chiral auxiliary, or a chiral reducing agent. Non-limiting examples of chiral reducing agents include alpine borane and prapine borane. Non-limiting examples of 1,2-reduction reactions involving chiral catalysts are Corey-Bakshi-Shibata reduction, Noyori hydrogenation, and Noyori transfer hydrogenation, The oxidation/reduction reaction sequence can be carried out in situ using dynamic kinetic resolution. A dynamic kinetic resolution can further involve a reaction with a hydroxyl protecting agent, which removes the desired stereoisomer from the reduction/oxidation equilibrium. In a non-limiting example, a dynamic kinetic resolution of chiral secondary alcohols can involve reduction/oxidation equilibration using η5-Ph5CpRu(CO)2H in combination with enantioselective esterification using isopropenyl acetate catalyzed by a lipase enzyme (e.g., lipase B from Candida Antarctica, see, e.g., Martin-Matute et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 127:8817-8825, 2005).
Epimerization can also be carried out on a compound containing a tetrahydropyran-2-yl-acetaldehyde moiety, in which carbon 2 of the pyran ring exhibits an undesired stereochemical identity. Contacting this compound with L-proline can provide equilibrium between two stereoisomers. If other, non-equilibrating stereogenic centers are present in the compound, the most stable stereoisomer will be present in a larger quantity relative to other stereoisomer(s) in equilibrium with the most stable stereoisomer.
The following examples are meant to illustrate the invention. They are not meant to limit the invention in any way.
