TECHNICAL FIELD
Polymeric materials prepared from free-radically polymerizable spirobisindane monomers are functionalized to provide a sulfonyl-containing group. The resulting sulfonyl-containing polymeric material and a method of making the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material are described.
BACKGROUND
Ion exchange resins used in high pressure chromatography columns are desired that can withstand the relatively high pressures and/or high temperatures typically encountered. Higher pressures can often impart greater separation power. Such ion exchange resins are usually crosslinked to provide resilience to deformation or fracture under high pressure and/or high temperature conditions. For example, many commercially available ion exchange resins for high pressure separations are based on divinylbenzene crosslinked polystyrene that are functionalized to provide ionic groups.
For some applications, it is desirable that the ion exchange resins be porous. Porous materials with micropores (i.e., pores less than 2 nanometers) can be particularly useful for some separations. The micropores can lead to increased capacity, improved kinetics of interaction with charged materials and ions, or both. Porous ion exchange resins have been prepared by the addition of a sulfonic acid group to polymeric materials prepared from divinyl benzene. Such materials are described, for example, in Liu et al., Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 271, 52-58. While these materials can contain some micropores, the majority of the pores tend to be in the mesopore range (e.g., 2 to 50 nanometer pore diameter).
Polymeric materials that are porous have been prepared using spirobisindane-containing materials. For example, Reaction Scheme A shows the reaction of 5,5′,6,6′-tetrahydroxy-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-1,1′-spirobisindane with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile to form a polymeric material with fused dioxin rings as linking groups. These polymers and their synthesis methods are described more fully, for example, in Budd et al., Chem. Commun., 2004, 230 and in U.S. Pat. No. 7,690,514 (McKeown et al.). These polymeric materials have a rigid backbone containing regular points of contortion. This characteristic of the backbone results in poor packing of the polymeric chains with each other. The interstitial space between the polymer chains tends to result in microporosity. These polymeric materials are not suitable, however, for applications that require large volumes of material. The polymerization times tend to be lengthy (e.g., several days) and the monomers used to form the polymers are often quite expensive.

In Formula (I), each R1 is hydrogen, halo, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or aralkyl, wherein at least one R1 is hydrogen. Each R2 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, combines with a R3 connected to a same carbon atom to form a cyclic alkyl, or combines with a R3 connected to the same carbon atom to form a cyclic alkyl that is fused to one or more carbocyclic rings.

Each R4 is independently hydrogen or combines with R3 connected to the adjacent carbon atom to form a carbon-carbon bond.
Each R1 in Formula (I) is hydrogen, halo, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or aralkyl. Suitable halo groups for R1 include, but are not limited to, chloro and bromo. Suitable alkyl groups often have up to 20 carbon atoms, up to 10 carbon atoms, up to 6 carbon atoms, or up to 4 carbon atoms. For example, the alkyl groups can have 1 to 10 carbon atoms, 3 to 10 carbon atoms, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, 3 to 6 carbon atoms, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms.

That is, there are at least two R1 groups equal to hydrogen in the monomer of Formula (I). This is often the position that undergoes a reaction with the sulfonyl-containing compound to introduce a group of formula —SO2R5 into the precursor polymeric material during the formation of the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material. That is, in the final sulfonyl-containing polymeric material, one of the R1 groups equal to hydrogen in the precursor polymeric material prepared from the monomer of Formula (I) is replaced with a sulfonyl-containing group of formula —SO2R5.
Each R2 in Formula (I) is independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, combines with a R3 connected to a same carbon atom to form a cyclic alkyl, or combines with a R3 connected to the same carbon atom to form a cyclic alkyl that is fused to one or more carbocyclic rings.

In many embodiments, the cyclic alkyl group has 3 to 8 carbon atoms or 3 to 6 carbon atoms. The cyclic alkyl group can optionally be fused to one or more carbocyclic rings. Each carbocyclic ring typically has up to 10 carbon atoms, up to 8 carbon atoms, or up to 6 carbon atoms and can be aromatic (i.e., unsaturated), partially unsaturated, or saturated. The fused carbocyclic rings are often benzene rings. An example cyclic alkyl with one or more fused carbocyclic rings is fluorenyl (i.e., a monovalent radical of fluorene).
Each R3 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, combines with a R2 connected to a same carbon atom to form a cyclic alkyl, combines with a R2 connected to the same carbon atom to form a cyclic alkyl that is fused to one or more carbocyclic rings, or combines with R4 connected to adjacent carbon atom to form a carbon-carbon bond.

Each carbocyclic ring typically has up to 10 carbon atoms, up to 8 carbon atoms, or up to 6 carbon atoms and can be aromatic (i.e., unsaturated), partially unsaturated, or saturated. The fused carbocyclic rings are often benzene rings. An example cyclic alkyl with one or more fused carbocyclic rings is fluorenyl (i.e., a monovalent radical of fluorene).
Each R4 is independently hydrogen or combines with R3 connected to an adjacent carbon atom to form a carbon-carbon bond.
In some specific embodiments of the monomer of Formula (I), R1 is hydrogen or halo, R2 is an alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms (e.g., 1 to 6 carbon atoms, 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or 1 carbon atom), R3 is an alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms (e.g., 1 to 6 carbon atoms, 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or 1 carbon atom), and R4 is hydrogen. In other more specific embodiments of the monomer of Formula (I), each R1 is hydrogen, R2 is an alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms (e.g., 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or 1 carbon atom), R3 is an alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms (e.g., 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or 1 carbon atom), and R4 is hydrogen. In an even more specific embodiment of the monomer of Formula (I), each R1 is hydrogen, R2 is methyl, R3 is methyl, and R4 is hydrogen; this monomer is 3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-1,1′-spirobisindan-6,6′-divinyl.
The monomers of Formula (I) can be prepared using any known method. For example, monomers can be prepared as shown in Reaction Scheme B where all of the R1 and R4 groups are hydrogen and where all of the R2 and R3 groups are alkyl or hydrogen. A bisphenol compound of Formula (II) is reacted with methane sulfonic acid (MSA) to produce the spirobisindan-6,6′-diol compound of Formula (III). The spirobisindan-6,6′-diol can be reacted with trifluoromethane sulfonic anhydride (TFMSA) in the presence of pyridine and a solvent such as methylene chloride to produce the spirobisindan-6,6′-bistriflate compound of Formula (IV). The spirobisindan-6,6′-bistriflate compound can subsequently be subjected to a Stille coupling reaction to produce the spirobisindane-6,6′-divinyl compound of Formula (V). That is, the compound of Formula (IV) can be reacted with tributyl(vinyl) tin in the presence of lithium chloride, a palladium catalyst, and a solvent such as N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) to introduce polymerizable groups. The details for this synthesis approach are further described in the Example section for the preparation of the monomer 3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-1,1′-spirobisindan-6,6′-divinyl starting from bisphenol A as the compound of Formula (II).
Monomers of Formula (I) can be prepared as shown in Reaction Scheme C where R3 and R4 combine to form a carbon-carbon double bond and where R2 is an alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or aralkyl. The chemistry involved in the formation of the dione (Compound (VII)) is described in Org. Lett., 2008, 10, 2641. More specifically, diethyl-1,3-acetonedicarboxylate and methoxybenzene are reacted in the presence of sulfuric acid to form Compound (VI). This reaction is followed by hydrolysis and then Friedel-Crafts acylation mediated by polyphosphoric acid (PPA) and aluminum trichloride (AlCl3) to form Compound (VII). Various monomers of Formula (I) can be prepared from the dione (Compound (VII)) using Grignard reactions. This type of reaction is exemplified in Reaction Scheme C using R2MgBr as the Grignard reagent. The dehydrated spirobisindane (Compound (VIII)) is formed after treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid. Compound (VIII) is reacted with boron tribromide (BBr3) to convert the methoxy groups to hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl groups are then reacted with trifluoromethane sulfonic anhydride (TFMSA) in the presence of pyridine and a solvent such as methylene chloride to produce Compound (IX) with triflate groups. The triflate groups are reacted with tributyl(vinyl) tin in the presence of lithium chloride, a palladium catalyst, and a solvent such as N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). This reaction, which is often referred to as a Stille coupling reaction, introduces the polymerizable groups as shown in Compound (X).
The polymerizable composition used to prepare the precursor polymeric material includes at least a monomer of Formula (I). In some embodiments, the only monomer in the polymerizable composition is of Formula (I) and the precursor polymeric material is a homopolymer. In other embodiments, the polymerizable composition includes a monomer of Formula (I) and at least one co-monomer that is not of Formula (I). Such a precursor polymeric material is a copolymer.
The co-monomers are often selected to prepare a precursor polymeric material that is porous. In some embodiments, the co-monomers include one or more polyvinyl aromatic monomers. The term “polyvinyl aromatic monomer” refers to a monomer that is not of Formula (I) and that has a plurality (e.g., two or three) of vinyl groups that are each bonded to an aromatic carbocyclic group. The aromatic carbocyclic group has at least one aromatic carbocyclic ring and can have 1 to 5 optional rings that are connected to or fused to the aromatic carbocyclic ring. The additional rings can be aromatic, aliphatic, or a combination thereof. Any of the rings optionally can be substituted with one or more alkyl groups. The aromatic carbocyclic group usually has 5 to 20 carbon atoms, 6 to 20 carbon atoms, or 6 to 10 carbon atoms. The polyvinyl aromatic monomer is often a divinyl aromatic monomer (e.g., divinylbenzene or divinylbenzene substituted with one or more alkyl groups) or a trivinyl aromatic monomer (e.g., trivinylbenzene or trivinylbenzene substituted with one or more alkyl groups).
The polymerizable compositions often contain at least 1 weight percent, at least 5 weight percent, at least 10 weight percent, at least 20 weight percent, at least 30 weight percent, at least 40 weight percent, or at least 50 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I). For the preparation of polymeric material with micropores, the polymerizable composition often contains at least 40 weight percent, at least 50 weight percent, at least 60 weight percent, at least 70 weight percent, at least 80 weight percent, or at least 90 weight percent of the monomer of Formula (I).
In some embodiments, the polymerizable composition can include 1 to 99 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I) and 1 to 99 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer. For example, the polymerizable composition can contain 10 to 90 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I) and 10 to 90 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer, 20 to 80 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I) and 20 to 80 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer, 30 to 70 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I) and 30 to 70 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer, or 40 to 60 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I) and 40 to 60 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer. The weight percent is based on a total weight of monomers in the polymerizable composition.
In other embodiments, the polymerizable composition can include 50 to 99 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I) and 1 to 50 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer. For example, the polymerizable composition can contain 60 to 99 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I) and 1 to 40 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer, 70 to 99 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I) and 1 to 30 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer, 80 to 99 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I) and 1 to 20 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer, or 90 to 99 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I) and 1 to 10 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer. The weight percent is based on a total weight of monomers in the polymerizable composition.
Some polyvinyl aromatic monomers contain one or more mono-vinyl aromatic monomers as impurities. As used herein, the term “mono-vinyl aromatic monomer” refers to a monomer having a single vinyl group bonded to an aromatic carbocyclic group. The aromatic carbocyclic group has at least one aromatic carbocyclic ring and can have 1 to 5 optional rings that are connected to or fused to the aromatic carbocyclic ring. The additional rings can be aromatic, aliphatic, or a combination thereof. Any of the rings optionally can be substituted with one or more alkyl groups. The aromatic carbocyclic group usually has 5 to 20 carbon atoms, 6 to 20 carbon atoms, or 6 to 10 carbon atoms. Example mono-vinyl aromatic monomers include, but are not limited to, styrene, ethyl styrene, and the like.
In some embodiments, the polyvinyl aromatic monomer contains up to 25 weight percent, up 20 weight percent, up to 15 weight percent, up to 10 weight percent, or up to 5 weight percent mono-vinyl aromatic monomer. For example, technical grade divinylbenzene typically contains about 20 weight percent ethyl styrene. The weight percent is based on a total weight of the mono-vinyl aromatic monomer and the polyvinyl aromatic monomer.
Considering impurities that may be present in the polyvinyl aromatic monomers, the polymerizable compositions often contain 1 to 99 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I), 0 to 25 weight percent of mono-vinyl aromatic monomer, and 1 to 99 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer. In another example, the polymerizable composition contains 1 to 98 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I), 1 to 20 weight percent of a mono-vinyl aromatic monomer, and 1 to 98 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer. In yet another example, the polymerizable composition contains 5 to 90 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I), 5 to 19 weight percent of a mono-vinyl aromatic monomer, and 5 to 90 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer. If polymeric material that is porous is desired, the amount of mono-vinyl aromatic monomer is typically selected to be less than 15 weight percent, less than 10 weight percent, or less than 5 weight percent and often additionally contains at least 50 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I). The weight percent is based on a total weight of monomer in the polymerizable composition.
In some embodiments, a polymeric material that is microporous is desired. To prepare microporous polymeric material, the polymerizable composition often contains 40 to 99 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I), 0 to 15 weight percent of a mono-vinyl aromatic monomer, and 1 to 60 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer. For example, the polymerizable composition contains 50 to 99 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I), 0 to 10 weight percent of a mono-vinyl aromatic monomer, and 1 to 50 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer. In another example, the polymerizable composition contains 60 to 99 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I), 0 to 10 weight percent of a mono-vinyl aromatic monomer, and 1 to 40 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer. In yet another example, the polymerizable composition contains 70 to 99 weight percent of a monomer of Formula (I), 0 to 10 weight percent of a mono-vinyl aromatic monomer, and 1 to 30 weight percent of a polyvinyl aromatic monomer. The weight percent is based on a total weight of monomer in the polymerizable composition.
In addition to the various monomers, the polymerizable compositions typically include an initiator for free radical polymerization reactions. Any suitable free radical initiator can be used. In some embodiments, the free radical initiator is a thermal initiator that is usually activated at a temperature above room temperature. In other embodiments, the free radical initiator is a redox initiator. Suitable free radical initiators are typically selected to be miscible with the monomers included in the polymerizable composition. The free radical initiator is typically present in an amount in a range of 0.05 to 10 weight percent, in a range of 0.05 to 5 weight percent, in a range of 0.05 to 2 weight percent, in a range of 0.05 to 1 weight percent, in a range of 0.1 to 5 weight percent, in a range of 0.2 to 5 weight percent, in a range of 0.5 to 5 weight percent, in a range of 0.1 to 2 weight percent, or in a range of 0.1 to 1 weight percent. The weight percent is based on a total weight of monomer in the polymerizable composition. Both the type and amount of initiator can affect the polymerization rate, which in turn can influence the formation of porous polymeric material.
Suitable thermal initiators include, but are not limited to, organic peroxides and azo compounds. Example azo compounds include, but are not limited to, those commercially available under the trade designation VAZO from E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co. (Wilmington, Del.) such as VAZO 64 (2,2′-azobis(isobutyronitrile), which is often referred to as AIBN) and VAZO 52 (2,2′-azobis(2,4-dimethylpentanenitrile)). Other azo compounds are commercially available from Wako Chemicals USA, Inc. (Richmond, Va.) such as V-601 (dimethyl 2,2′-azobis(2-methylproprionate)), V-65 (2,2′-azobis(2,4-dimethyl valeronitrile)), and V-59 (2,2′-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile)). Organic peroxides include, but are not limited to, bis(1-oxoaryl)peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide (BPO), bis(1-oxoalkyl)peroxides such as lauroyl peroxide, and dialkyl peroxides such as dicumyl peroxide or di-tert-butyl peroxide, and mixtures thereof. The temperature needed to activate the thermal imitator is often in a range of 25° C. to 160° C., 30° C. to 160° C., or 40° C. to 160° C.
Suitable redox initiators include arylsulfinate salts or triarylsulfonium salts in combination with a metal in an oxidized state, a peroxide, or a persulfate. Specific arylsulfinate salts include tetraalkylammonium arylsulfinates such as tetrabutylammonium 4-ethoxycarbonylbenzenesulfinate, tetrabutylammonium 4-trifluoromethylbenzenesulfinate, and tetrabutylammonium 3-trifluoromethylbenzenesulfinate. Specific triarylsulfonium salts include those with a triphenylsulfonium cation and with an anion selected from PF6−, AsF6−, and SbF6−. Suitable metal ions include, for example, ions of group III metals, transition metals, and lanthanide metals. Specific metal ions include, but are not limited to, Fe(III), Co(III), Ag(I), Ag(II), Cu(II), Ce(III), Al (III), Mo(VI), and Zn(II). Suitable peroxides include benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, and the like. Suitable persulfates include, for example, ammonium persulfate, tetraalkylammonium persulfate (e.g., tetrabutylammonium persulfate), and the like.
The polymerizable composition typically also includes a solvent. Any suitable solvent or mixture of solvents can be selected. The one or more solvents are typically selected to be miscible with the monomers included in the polymerizable composition. Stated differently, the monomers in the polymerizable composition are typically dissolved in one or more solvents. Additionally, the selection of the one or more solvents can alter the porosity of the precursor polymeric material formed from the polymerizable composition. The porosity can often be increased by delaying the onset of phase separation of the growing polymeric chains during the polymerization process. That is, the use of solvents with good solubility for both the monomers and the growing polymeric material tends to enhance porosity. Solubility parameter calculations can be used to select a solvent or solvent mixture that is close to that of the polymeric material. Solvents that tend to enhance porosity include, but are not limited to, ethyl acetate, amyl acetate (i.e., n-pentyl acetate), and methyl ethyl ketone.
The onset of phase separation of the growing polymeric chains also can be delayed by reducing the rate of polymerization. The rate can be reduced by using a lower polymerization temperature and selecting an initiator that is activated at a lower temperature. The amount of the initiator added to the polymerizable composition can also influence the rate of reaction. That is, the reaction rate is typically increased with the addition of higher amounts of the initiator.
Additionally, the percent solids of the polymerizable composition can influence the rate of polymerization. Typically, lower percent solids tend to favor porosity. The percent solids are often in a range of 0.5 to 50 weight percent, 1 to 40 weight percent, 1 to 30 weight percent, 1 to 20 weight percent, 1 to 15 weight percent, 1 to 10 weight percent, 1 to 6 weight percent, or 2 to 6 weight percent based on a total weight of the polymerizable composition.
Other types of polymerization methods can be used, if desired, such as, for example, emulsion polymerization methods and suspension polymerization methods. If porous polymeric material is desired, the polymerizable compositions and reaction conditions can be selected using the principles discussed above.
The polymerized product, which is the precursor polymeric material, can be a monolith that can be easily broken apart for washing to remove any residual monomer. The washed product can be dried to form a powder. Alternatively, if suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization methods are used, the polymerized product can be in the form of beads or particles.
The precursor polymeric material can be porous. The porosity can be characterized from adsorption isotherms obtained at various partial pressures (e.g., 10−6 to 0.98) using nitrogen or argon as the sorbate under cryogenic conditions. The total porosity can be calculated based on the total amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure close to 0.95 or higher. The total porosity is often at least 0.20 cm3/gram, at least 0.30 cm3/gram, at least 0.40 cm3/gram, or at least 0.45 cm3/gram. The total porosity can be, for example, up to 1.2 cm3/gram or higher, up to 1.1 cm3/gram, up to 1.0 cm3/gram, up to 0.95 cm3/gram, or up to 0.90 cm3/gram.
The total porosity and the pore size distribution of the precursor polymeric material can be varied by choice of monomers in the polymerizable composition and the reaction conditions such as solvent selection, the percent solids of the polymerizable composition, and the polymerization rate. In many embodiments, the porous polymeric material is microporous, mesoporous, or both. Homopolymers prepared from polymerizable compositions containing a monomer of Formula (I) tend to be microporous. Depending on the specific reaction conditions, the porosity can be predominately microporous. Various polyvinyl aromatic monomers that are not of Formula (I) can be added to the polymerizable composition to prepare precursor polymeric material having both micropores and mesopores. As the amount of the polyvinyl aromatic monomer is increased relative to the monomer of Formula (I), the percentage of the total porosity attributable to micropores tends to decrease.
For some applications, precursor polymeric material having a porosity that is mainly microporous can be advantageous. Micropores tend to increase the ion exchange capacity of the sulfonyl-containing materials (e.g., more ionic or charged materials can be adsorbed on the ion exchange resins), tend to improve the kinetics of adsorption (e.g., ionic or charged materials can be adsorbed faster or more efficiently on the ion exchange resins), or both.
The total surface area can be calculated from BET (Brunauer-Emmett, and Teller) analysis of the isotherm data at relative pressures less than 0.35, less than 0.30, less than 0.25, or less than 0.20. The total surface area is often at least 100 m2/gram, at least 200 m2/gram, at least 400 m2/gram, or at least 600 m2/gram. The total surface area of the precursor polymeric material can be, for example, up to 1000 m2/gram or higher, up to 900 m2/gram, up to 850 m2/gram, or up to 800 m2/gram.
The precursor polymeric material is subsequently treated with a sulfonyl-containing compound. This reaction results in the addition of a sulfonyl-containing group of formula —SO2R5 to the precursor polymeric material and the formation of a sulfonyl-containing polymeric material. The sulfonyl-containing group typically replaces a hydrogen atom that is bonded to a carbon atom that is part of an aromatic ring of the precursor polymer. For example, the sulfonyl-containing group often replaces a R1 group that is equal to hydrogen in the precursor polymer. Alternatively or additionally, the sulfonyl-containing group can replace a hydrogen atom that is bonded to a carbon atom in any aryl group, in the aryl portion of any aralkyl group, or in the aryl portion of any alkaryl group in the precursor polymeric material. Further, the sulfonyl-containing group can be added to a double bond in the precursor polymeric material where groups R3 and R4 combine to form a carbon-carbon double bond. At least one aromatic ring in the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material contains a sulfonyl-containing group. Typically, the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material has a maximum number of sulfonyl-containing groups equal to the total number of aromatic rings. There are usually no more than one sulfonyl-containing groups per aromatic ring in the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material.
The sulfonyl-containing group is of formula —SO2R5, where the group R5 is —OH, —NH2, or —N(R6)-Q-N(R6)2. Any of these R5 can be in the form of a salt depending on the pH conditions. Suitable cations for salts include, but are not limited to, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, ammonium ions, or tetraalkylammonium ions. Suitable anions for salts include, but are not limited to, halides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, and carboxylates (e.g., acetate).
In some embodiments, the sulfonyl-containing group is of formula —SO2OH or a salt of the conjugate base (the anion is —SO3−1). In other embodiments, the sulfonyl-containing group is of formula —SO2NH2 or a salt of the conjugate acid (the cation is —SO2NH3+1). In still other embodiments, the sulfonyl-containing group is of formula —SO2NR6-Q-N(R6)2 or the salt of the conjugate acid. Each group R6 is independently hydrogen or alkyl. Suitable R6 alkyl groups often have 1 to 10 carbon atoms, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or 1 to 3 carbon atoms. In many examples, R6 alkyl groups are methyl or ethyl. The group Q is a single bond, alkylene, or a group of formula -(Q1-NR6)x-Q2- where each Q1 and Q2 is independently an alkylene and where x is an integer in a range of 1 to 4. Suitable alkylene groups for Q, Q1, and Q2 often have 1 to 10 carbon atoms, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or 1 to 3 carbon atoms. If Q is a single bond, the sulfonyl group has a hydrazinyl group (i.e., —NH—N(R6)2, which is often —NH—NH2). The variable x in the formula -(Q1-NR6)x-Q2- is usually an integer in a range of 1 to 4, 1 to 3, or 1 to 2.
Any known method can be used to introduce the sulfonyl-containing group into the precursor polymeric material. That is, the precursor can be reacted with any known sulfonyl-containing compound. The formation of the specific —SO2R5 group often includes reacting the precursor with a sulfonyl-containing compound and then further reacting the intermediate polymeric material with another compound such as water, ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, a polylamine, or hydrazine. The term “polyamine” refers to a compound having at least two amino groups of formula —N(R6)2 where R6 is the same as defined above. The polyamine is often of formula NH(R6)-Q-N(R6).
In some embodiments, the precursor polymeric material is reacted with a halogenated sulfonic acid (e.g., chlorosulfonic acid) as the sulfonyl-containing compound. The precursor polymeric material is mixed with a solution of the halogenated sulfonic acid dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent. Suitable organic solvents include various halogenated solvents such as 1,2-dichloroethane, methylene chloride, and chloroform. The solution of the halogenated sulfonic acid is often added to the precursor polymeric material at a temperature below room temperature such as, for example, at about 0° C. The initial reaction can be quite exothermic so, if adequate care is not taken, the solvent can boil during the addition. After the reactants are combined, the temperature is often increased to any desired temperature such as room temperature up to the temperature associated with reflux conditions. The reaction time can range from a few minutes to 24 hours. The reaction time and the reaction temperature can be varied to prepare polymeric materials with different amounts of the sulfonyl-containing group. After this reaction, the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material has attached —SO2X groups where X is halo such as chloro. These groups are typically reacted further to provide a group of formula —SO2R5. To prepare the group —SO2OH, the intermediate polymeric material with attached —SO2X group is placed in water. The conversion of the —SO2X groups to —SO2OH groups often can occur at room temperature within 30 minutes, within 1 hour, within 2 hours, within 4 hours, within 8 hours, within 12 hours, within 24 hours, within 36 hours, within 48 hours, within 60 hours, or within 72 hours.
In other embodiments, the precursor polymeric material is reacted with concentrated sulfuric acid or with concentrated sulfuric acid in the presence of a catalyst such as silver sulfate. When a catalyst is present, the reaction typically proceeds faster. With or without the catalyst, the reaction temperature is often in a range of room temperature (e.g., 20-25° C.) to 150° C., in a range of room temperature to 125° C., or in a range of room temperature to 100° C. The reaction times can vary from a few minutes (e.g., 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 30 minutes) to 24 hours or longer. As with halogenated sulfonic acid, the reaction time and the reaction temperature can be varied to prepare polymeric materials with different amounts of the sulfonyl-containing group. After this reaction, the sulfonyl containing polymeric material has attached —SO2OH groups.
Typically, it is desirable to introduce as many sulfonyl-containing groups as possible into the precursor polymeric material. An excess of the sulfonyl-containing compound is used. That is, the moles of sulfonyl-containing compound can be up to 10 times the number of moles of aromatic rings in the precursor polymeric material. If it is desirable to have fewer sulfonyl-containing groups, the moles of sulfonyl-containing compound can be lowered, the reaction time can be shortened, or the reaction temperature can be lowered. For example, in some embodiments, there is not a sulfonyl group on each aromatic ring and the molar ratio of sulfonyl-containing compound to aromatic rings is less than 1.
To prepare —SO2NH2 groups, a sulfonyl-containing intermediate polymeric material having —SO2X groups (prepared using a halogenated sulfonic acid as described above) can be treated with ammonia gas or ammonium hydroxide. To maximize conversion of the —SO2X groups to —SO2NH2 groups, the moles of ammonia or ammonium hydroxide are often as much as 10 times the number of moles of —SO2X groups. This reaction typically often occurs at room temperature within 30 minutes, within 1 hour, within 2 hours, within 4 hours, within 8 hours, within 12 hours, within 24 hours, within 36 hours, within 48 hours, within 60 hours, or within 72 hours. The reaction temperature is often in a range from room temperature to the temperature associated with reflux conditions.
To prepare —SO2NH—NH2 groups, a sulfonyl-containing intermediate polymeric material having —SO2X groups (prepared using a halogenated sulfonic acid as described above) can be treated with hydrazine. Either hydrazine monohydrate or anhydrous hydrazine can be dissolved in an organic solvent. To maximize conversion of the —SO2X groups to —SO2NH—NH2 groups, the moles of hydrazine are often as much as 10 times the number of moles of —SO2X groups. This reaction typically often occurs at room temperature within 30 minutes, within 1 hour, within 2 hours, within 4 hours, within 8 hours, within 12 hours, within 24 hours, within 36 hours, within 48 hours, within 60 hours, or within 72 hours. The reaction temperature is often in a range from room temperature to the temperature associated with reflux conditions. Anhydrous conditions or organic solvents are often selected in place of water to minimize the preparation of —SO2OH groups.
To prepare —SO2NR6-Q-N(R6)2 where Q is a group of formula -(Q1-NR6)x-Q2-, a sulfonyl-containing intermediate polymeric material having —SO2X groups (prepared using a halogenated sulfonic acid as described above) can be treated with an amino-containing compounds of formula (R6)HN-Q-N(R6)2 (e.g., (R6)HN-(Q1-NR6)x-Q2N(R6)2). Suitable examples of these compounds include, but are not limited to, ethylene diamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, and the like. To maximize conversion of the —SO2X groups to —SO2NR6-Q-N(R6)2 groups, the moles of reactive amino-containing groups are often at much as 10 times the number of moles of —SO2X groups. This reaction typically often occurs at room temperature within 30 minutes, within 1 hour, within 2 hours, within 4 hours, within 8 hours, within 12 hours, within 24 hours, within 36 hours, within 48 hours, within 60 hours, or within 72 hours. The reaction temperature is often in a range from room temperature to the temperature associated with reflux conditions. Anhydrous conditions or organic solvents are often selected in place of water to minimize the preparation of —SO2OH groups.
The sulfonyl-containing polymeric material typically contains at least 0.2 milliequivalents of —SO2R5 per gram. In some embodiments, the amount of —SO2R5 is in a range of 0.2 to 7 milliequivalents per gram, in a range of 0.2 to 6 milliequivalents per gram, in a range of 0.2 to 5 milliequivalents per gram, in a range of 0.2 to 4.5 milliequivalents per gram, in a range of 0.5 to 4 milliequivalents per gram, in a range of 1 to 4 milliequivalents per gram, in a range of 2 to 4 milliequivalents per gram, or in a range of 3 to 4 milliquivalents per gram of the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material. Any suitable method can be used to determine the milliequivalents per gram. In one preferred method, the total sulfur content of the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material is determined by elemental analysis.
In some embodiments, the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material has —SO2OH groups or a salt thereof and can be used as an ion exchange resin for the separation or concentration of a positively charged materials or ions. That is, the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material functions as a cation exchange resin. Positively charged materials tend to be retained longer by the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material than neutral materials or negatively charged materials or ions. Further, positively charged materials or ions with a greater positive charge (e.g., calcium ions) tend to be retained longer by the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material than positively charged materials or ions with a lower positive charge (e.g., sodium ions). In some embodiments, the pH conditions during separation are selected so that the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material is negatively charged.
In other embodiments, the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material has —SO2NH2 or —SO2NR6-Q-N(R6)2 groups or a salt thereof and can be used as an ion exchange resin for the separation or concentration of negatively charged materials or ions. That is, the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material functions as an anion exchange resin. Negatively charged materials tend to be retained longer by the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material than neutral materials or positively charged materials or ions. Further, negatively charged materials or ions with a greater negative charge (e.g., phosphate ions) tend to be retained longer by the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material than negatively charged materials or ions with lower negative charge (e.g., nitrate ions). In some embodiments, the pH conditions during separation are selected so that the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material is positively charged.
The ion exchange resins can be placed within a chromatographic column. The ion exchange resins can be used for analytical purposes, for separation of impurities from a desired material, or for concentration of the desired material.
Unlike polymers prepared according to Reaction Scheme A and as further described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,690,514 (McKeown et al.), the polymeric materials prepared from a monomer of Formula (I) are crosslinked. Thus, the sulfonyl-containing polymeric material prepared using the monomers of Formula (I) tend to swell less when placed into an organic solvent or aqueous medium. This may be desirable for some applications where a dimensional change may be undesirable when contacted with a solvent.

Gas Sorption Analysis:
Porosity and gas sorption experiments were performed using a Micromeritics Instrument Corporation (Norcross, Ga.) accelerated surface area and porosimetry (ASAP) 2020 system using adsorbates of ultra-high purity. The following is a typical method used for the characterization of the porosity within the exemplified materials. In a Micromeritics ½″ diameter sample tube, 60-150 mg of material was heated at 150° C. under ultra-high vacuum (3-7 μmHg) for 2 hours on the analysis port of the ASAP 2020 to remove residual solvent and other adsorbates. (Examples 5 and 6 were heated at 70° C. for 6 hours and then 110° C. for 1 hour under ultra-high vacuum (3-7 μmHg) on the analysis port of the ASAP 2020 to remove residual solvent and other adsorbates.) Nitrogen sorption isotherms at 77 K were obtained of the material using low pressure dosing (5 cm3/g) at p/p°<0.1 and a pressure table of linearly spaced pressure points from p/p°=0.1-0.95. The method made use of the following equilibrium intervals: 90 seconds at p/p°<10−5, 40 seconds at p/p°=10−5−0.1, and 20 seconds at p/p°>0.1. Helium was used for the free space determination, after nitrogen sorption analysis, both at ambient temperature and at 77 K. Apparent surface areas were calculated from nitrogen adsorption data by multipoint BET analysis. Apparent micropore distributions were calculated from nitrogen adsorption data by DFT analysis using the standard nitrogen DFT model. Total pore volume was calculated from the total amount of nitrogen adsorbed at p/p°=0.95. Argon sorption isotherms at 77 K were obtained using low pressure dosing (5 cm3/g) at p/p°<0.1 and a pressure table of linearly spaced pressure points from p/p°=0.1-0.95. The method made use of the following equilibrium intervals: 90 seconds at p/p°<10−5, 40 seconds at p/p°=10−5−0.1, and 20 seconds at p/p°>0.1. Helium was used for the free space determination, after argon sorption analysis, both at ambient temperature and at 77 K. Apparent surface areas were calculated from argon adsorption data by multipoint BET analysis. Apparent micropore distributions were calculated from argon adsorption data by DFT analysis using the argon at 77 K on carbon slit pores by NLDFT model. Total pore volume was calculated from the total amount of argon adsorbed at p/p°=0.95. BET, DFT and total pore volume analyses were performed using Micromeritics MicroActive Version 1.01 software.
Elemental Analysis:
Samples were analyzed for weight percent carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur by combustion using a LECO TruSpec Micro CHNS elemental analyzer (LECO Corp, St. Joseph, Mich.). The samples were run in triplicate or better. Results are reported as the averages of replicate determinations. In order to eliminate ambient water from the analysis, aliquots of each sample were dried on a steam-plate under nitrogen for 2 hours and allowed to cool in a nitrogen purged dry-box for 30 minutes before weighing. The samples were placed in silver capsules and crimped and placed on the auto-sampler in ambient conditions.
The LECO TruSpec Micro CHNS instrument was calibrated by first base-lining the instrument with ambient air until the CHNS detectors are stabilized. Next, 3-4 empty crucibles were measured and set as instrument blanks. Finally, a calibration curve was generated with sulfamethazine as a standard. Based on this procedure the standard deviation for each element was: less than +/−0.5 weight percent for carbon, less than +/−0.3 weight percent for hydrogen, less than +/−0.3 weight percent for nitrogen and less than +/−0.3 weight percent for sulfur.
Procedure for Determination of Cationic Exchange Capacity by Liquid Titration:
