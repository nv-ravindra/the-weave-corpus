TECHNICAL FIELD
This invention is directed to organosilicon polymers containing benzoic acid esters in form of particles to be used in topical preparations for affording protection against sunlight or other radiation.
BACKGROUND
There is a constantly increasing need for sunscreen protection agents in a population that is exposed to an increasing amount of damaging sunlight. The damage can be immediate and long-term, with effects ranging from sunburn, rashes, and cell and tissues damage to premature wrinkling and skin cancer. In this sense, many sunscreening chemicals have been developed in the past protecting against the harmful effect of UV-A and/or UV-B wavelength and even shorter wavelength. These chemicals are usually incorporated either alone or in combination with each other into cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations which are widely known and used.
Most UV filters used in sunscreen compositions are monomeric compounds having the inherent risk that such compounds can penetrate the skin barrier, which is a highly undesirable effect. Thus, the major drawbacks derived from the use of common sunscreens are adverse reactions comprising cutaneous problems, such as allergic contact reactions, photocontact reactions, and drying or tightening of the skin. Subjective irritation associated with burning or stinging without objective erythema is the most common sensitivity complaint from sunscreens. This irritation is most frequently observed in the eye area. However, persistent objective irritant contact dermatitis is a more common side effect. Individuals with preexisting eczematous conditions have a significant predisposition to sensitization associated with their impaired cutaneous barrier. In addition, certain antibiotics, birth control pills, diuretics, antihistamines and antidepressants are among the commonly used drugs that can increase sensitivity to the sun's rays. Moreover, some of these cutaneous problems are induced by degradation products of the sunscreens formed upon exposure to sunlight.
Attempts have been made to solve the risk of skin penetration by encapsulating at least one type of UV filter which is present in a sunscreen formulation. For example, UV filters on the basis of polysiloxanes which may be either linear or cyclic have been described in WO93/04665, WO94/06404, EP538431, EP392883 and EP358584. With these polysiloxanes the risk of skin penetration is lower, but it is sometimes difficult to incorporate the polysiloxanes in sunscreen compositions due to incompatibility problems. Patent application WO2005/053631 refers to microcapsules with UV filter activity, wherein at least one type of crosslinkable chromophore with UV-A and/or UV-B and/or UV-C filter activity, and optionally at least one type of crosslinkable monomer which has no UV-A and/or UV-B and/or UV-C filter activity, are subjected to a crosslinking reaction in the absence of non-crosslinkable chromophores with UV-A and/or UV-B and/or UV-C filter activity. The invention also refers to sunscreen compositions comprising said microcapsules.
The prior art also describes some UV absorbers in the form of particles. In this sense, patent application WO2005/120440 refers to particles comprising an inorganic network and organic compounds covalently bonded to the network via a spacer group, characterised in that the organic compounds are present in the interior of the particles and optionally also on the surface of the particles. The invention also refers to formulations and compositions comprising said particles.
Patent application WO2009/101016 and Walenzyk, T. et al., International Journal of Cosmetic Science (2005), 27(3), 177-189, refer to particles that can be obtained by the reaction of inorganic nanoparticles with organic molecules containing functional groups, and use thereof as UV absorbers in cosmetic or dermatological applications.
Some benzoic acid ester compounds have been discovered and disclosed in WO2006100225, as well as their uses as photochemical precursors of ultraviolet absorbers, processes, cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions, personal care compositions, and industrial compositions related thereto. Some silane-functionalized ultraviolet screening agent precursors have also been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,328,346. These compounds undergo a photochemical transformation in the presence of sunlight that enhances their UV screening ability. However, it is still desired to develop new sunscreen compounds with high purity, a lower risk of side effects, increased photostability and increased persistence on the skin.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The present invention discloses silyl polymeric benzoic acid ester compounds useful as progressive photoprotective agents over UV radiation. An advantage conferred by these compounds over those described in the prior art is that they exhibit a micro- or nanoparticle form, wherein the particles, in addition to be homogenous and spherical or quasi spherical, have the relevant physical property of being essentially hermetic. Hermeticism avoids the release of the benzoic acid ester compounds and its phototransformation products. As such, they are endowed with a safer profile both for the sunscreen user and for the environment.
The polymers of the present invention also show a progressive UV protection depending on the time to sun exposition and the degree of sun radiation. Thus, compositions containing such compounds constitute a safer method to take sunbaths than conventional sunscreen products, since protection increases with time of sun exposition and the intensity of radiation.
The polymers of the invention exhibit ultraviolet absorbing properties per se and are susceptible to be photochemically converted in situ to another screen compound with a higher UV protection.

3-(3-(triethoxysilyl)propoxy)phenyl benzoate;
3-(3-(triethoxysilyl)propylcarbamoyloxy)phenyl benzoate;

4-(bis(3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl)amino)phenyl benzoate; and

In a particular embodiment of the invention, process 1 is carried out in the presence of a nitrogen-containing basic compound selected from the group consisting of ammonia, mono-alkylamine, di-alkylamine, tri-alkylamine, mono-alkanolamine, di-alkanolamine and tri-alkanolamine. Both alkyl and alkanol groups are linear or branched, having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Preferably, the nitrogen-containing basic compound is ammonia.
In a second aspect, the present invention relates to an organosilicon progressive photoprotective polymer obtainable by process 1 of the invention.
The photoprotective polymers of the present invention obtainable as shown in this specification exhibit a micro- or nanoparticle form. Moreover, such particles have homogenous and spherical or quasi spherical form and are essentially hermetic.
In the context of the present invention, by the term “micro- or nano-particle form” it is understood particles having an average size lower than 100 microns. Usually, said particles have an average size ranging from 10 nm to 10 microns, preferably form 100 to 1500 nm.
The preparation of the particles by the process 1 of the invention has the advantage that the product can be obtained in the form of a suspension containing about 1 to 25% solids consisting of the hermetic spherical or quasi spherical particles which can directly be used in cosmetic or dermatological compositions of the present invention. As mentioned before, the hermetism is a relevant physical property of the polymers of the invention since the release of benzoic acid esters or their phototransformation products is minimised.
The photoprotective activity is due to in situ conversion to sunscreen 2-hydroxybenzophenone polymers through a photo-Fries rearrangement of the benzoic acid ester fragment to a 2-hydroxybenzophenone fragment as shown in Scheme 1 for illustrative purposes: wherein R1-R5 and A are as defined above, and n is the number of monomeric units constituting the polymer.
These photoprotective polymers show a progressive UV protection depending on the time of sun exposure and the dose of sun radiation absorbed by the polymer. This progressive UV protection property is evidenced in their UVB and UVA screening ability. The extent of photo-Fries rearrangement is indicative of the amount of UVB radiation received.
Consequently, the compositions containing these photoprotective polymers provide a safer method to take sunbaths than conventional sunscreen products, since protection increases with time of sun exposure and dose of radiation.
Therefore, in another aspect the present invention relates to the use of a photoprotective polymer as defined above in the preparation of a cosmetic or dermatological composition for protecting a human or animal living body from UV radiation.
In another aspect the present invention relates to the use of a photoprotective polymer as defined above as photochemical precursors of UV absorbers.

Example 11: 4-(3-(3-(Triethoxysilyl)propyl)ureido)phenyl benzoate
3-Aminophenyl benzoate (461 mg, 2.162 mmol) (prepared according to Example 2 a) b)), triethylamine (0.30 mL, 2.162 mmol), and triethoxy(3-isocianatepropyl)silane (0.54 mL, 2.162 mmol) were dissolved in 25 mL of chloroform. The resultant solution was refluxed for 12 hours, cooled to room temperature, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. Cool pentane was added, the formed precipitate was filtered, and washed with 10 mL of additional pentane, thus affording 945 mg (2.954 mmol, yield=95%) of the title compound (HPLC purity=98%).

Example 12: 3-(3-(Triethoxysilyl)propoxy)phenyl benzoate Particles (P1)
1) Preparation
A mixture of ethanol (3.8 mL, 0.082 mmol) and deionized water (1.4 mL, 0.078 mmol) was heated in a water bath to 60° C. with stirring. A mixture of tetraethoxy silane, (TEOS, 396 mg, 1.903 mmol), and 3-(3-(triethoxysilyl)propoxy)phenyl benzoate (U.S. Pat. No. 4,328,346, 1.328 g, 3.172 mmol) was heated with no stirring in the same bath. When the ethanol/water mixture temperature attained 60° C., 1.7 mL of 30% of ammonia (0.011 mmol) were added and the stirring was augmented to assure a homogenous mixture. When the temperature attained again 60° C., the solution of TEOS and 3-(3-(triethoxysilyl)propoxy)phenyl benzoate was added and stirred for 15 seconds. The resultant suspension was allowed to stay for 2 hours at 60° C. The formed precipitate was filtered, washed with ethanol (3×20 mL) and dried under vacuum.
The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the remaining was analyzed by 1H-RMN spectroscopy to determinate the polymerisation is quantitative. The resultant particles comprise a 68% in weight of the precursor, expressed as 3-methoxyphenyl benzoate.
2) Particle Characterization
The obtained particles were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), size distribution, UV-Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and HPLC chromatography.
2.1) Particle Morphology
The image by SEM shows spherical particles with 500 nm diameter and homogenous aspect.
Size distribution shows that particles are monodisperse with size 570±170 nm.
2.2) UV-Vis Spectroscopy
A suspension of particles 3% (30 mg/mL) in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) having a viscosity of 20 cSt was added to a quartz surface covered with adhesive belt (Transpore®) at 2 mg/cm2. Particles show an intense absorption in UVB region with a queue going to UVA when the UV-Vis spectrum was registered with an integrating sphere in diffuse transmittance mode.
2.3) IR Spectroscopy
IR particles spectrum in KBr pellet show 1735 cm−1 y 1100 cm−1 bands corresponding to C═O tension of aromatic esters from precursor and O—Si—O from matrix, respectively.
2.4) HPLC Chromatography
Particles hermeticity was determined by extraction with solvents at high temperature, the extracts being analyzed by HPLC. Particles (200 mg) and 100 mL of a mixture of methanol and water ((80:20) were refluxed in a Soxhlet for 5 hours. Solvent samples were analyzed by HPLC under the following conditions:
Equipment: HP 1090 Liquid Chromatograph
Column: Reverse Phase Kromasil C18 5 μm 15×0.46
Mobile Phase: acetonitrile/water 80:20
Flow: 1.0 mL/min
Detection: absorption 254 nm
Particles chromatogram showed only a solvent dead point time, thus indicating that particles are essentially hermetic.
3) Particles Phototransformation
Particles, alone or suspended in PDMS, were irradiated at 35° C. in a Luzchem ICH-2 photoreactor provided with 16 UVB lamps (irradiance 70 W/m2).
3.1) UV-Vis Spectroscopy
The 3% particles suspension in PDMS was added to a quartz surface covered with adhesive belt (Transpore®) at 2 mg/cm2. The evolution of photoconversion was controlled by measuring the diffuse transmittance of the sample between 280 and 400 nm.
Particles spectrum shows the irradiated particles absorb both in UVB and UVA regions.
3.2) IR Specroscopy
IR Spectrum was recorded using a KBr pellet. The most significant changes in comparison with non-irradiated particles were the 1735 cm−1 band disappearance and the appearance of another one at 1630 cm−1, which is a characteristic of aromatic β-hidroxyketone C═O strength.
3.3) HPLC Chromatography
HPLC chromatography of irradiated microcapsules was performed in the same way as for non-irradiated microcapsules (2.4).
Particles chromatogram showed only a solvent dead point time, thus indicating that particles are essentially hermetic.
