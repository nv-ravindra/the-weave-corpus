FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present application discloses improved processes for synthesizing dihydropyridophthalazinone derivatives, such as for example, 5-fluoro-8-(4-fluorophenyl)-9-(1-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-8,9-dihydro-2H-pyrido[4,3,2-de]phthalazin-3(7H)-one and its stereoisomers, which is a potent poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, and novel synthetic intermediate compounds.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The family of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases (PARP) includes approximately 18 proteins, which all display a certain level of homology in their catalytic domain but differ in their cellular functions (Ame et al., BioEssays., 26(8), 882-893 (2004)). PARP-1 and PARP-2 are unique members of the family, in that their catalytic activities are stimulated by the occurrence of DNA strand breaks.
PARP has been implicated in the signaling of DNA damage through its ability to recognize and rapidly bind to DNA single or double strand breaks (D'Amours, et al., Biochem. J., 342, 249-268 (1999)). It participates in a variety of DNA-related functions including gene amplification, cell division, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA base excision repair as well as effects on telomere length and chromosome stability (d'Adda di Fagagna, et al., Nature Gen., 23(1), 76-80 (1999)).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
PARP has an essential role in facilitating DNA repair, controlling RNA transcription, mediating cell death, and regulating immune response. PARP inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in numerous models of disease particularly in models of ischemia reperfusion injury, inflammatory disease, degenerative diseases, protection from above adverse effects of cytotoxic compounds, and potentiation of cytotoxic cancer therapy. PARP inhibitors are efficacious in the prevention of ischemia reperfusion injury in models of myocardial infarction, stoke, other neural trauma, organ transplantation, as well as reperfusion of the eye, kidney, gut and skeletal muscle. PARP inhibitors are efficacious in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, gout, inflammatory bowel disease, CNS inflammation such as MS and allergic encephalitis, sepsis, septic shock, hemorrhagic shock, pulmonary fibrosis, and uveitis. PARP inhibitors also show benefit in several models of degenerative disease including diabetes and Parkinson's disease. PARP inhibitors ameliorate the liver toxicity following acetaminophen overdose, cardiac and kidney toxicities from doxorubicin and platinum based antineoplastic agents, as well as skin damage secondary to sulfur mustards. In various cancer models, PARP inhibitors are shown to potentiate radiation and chemotherapy by increasing apoptosis of cancer cells, limiting tumor growth, decreasing metastasis, and prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing animals.
