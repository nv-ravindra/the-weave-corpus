FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to novel chemical entities that have biological activity to modulate mammalian protein kinase enzymes.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The information provided herein is intended solely to assist the understanding of the reader. None of the information provided nor references cited is admitted to the prior art to the present invention. Each of the references cited herein is incorporated in its entirety.
The identification of the molecular events that underlie the development of human tumors presents a major challenge in the design of improved strategies in the prevention, management, and cure of these diseases (Barker, K. T. et al. BRK Tyrosine Kinase Expression in a High Proportion of Human Breast Carcinomas, Oncogene 1997, 15:799-805). The role of aberrantly regulated protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in human tumor development is the subject of intense investigation (Barker id.).
Protein kinases are regulators of cellular signaling and their functional dysregulation common in carcinogenesis and many other disease states or conditions (Mizuguchi, Y. et al., Breast Tumor Kinase/Protein Tyrosine Kinase 6 (Brk/PTK6). J Hepatology 2015, 63, 399-407; Mahmoud, K. A. et al., Discovery of 4-Anilino α-Carbolines as Novel Brk Inhibitors. Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2014, 24:1948-1951: Nobel, M. E. M. Protein Kinase Inhibitors: Insights into Drug Design from Structure. Science 2004, 303:1800-1805). The human genome encodes over 500 protein kinases that share a catalytic domain conserved in sequence and structure but which are notably different in how their catalysis is regulated (Nobel id.). Protein kinases regulate key signal transduction cascades that control or are involved in the control of physiological functions including cellular growth and proliferation, cell differentiation, cellular development, cell division, stress response, transcription regulation, aberrant mitogenesis, angiogeneisis, abnormal endothelial cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions during vascular development, inflammation, Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction, and several other cellular processes (see U.S. Pat. No. 8,470,818). Protein kinase inhibitors have been established as promising drugs that inhibit overactive protein kinases in cancer cells (Mahmoud id.).
A partial, non-limiting list of these kinases includes: BRK, FGR, PDGFRα(V561D), DDR2, LYNa, SRM, PDGFRα, LCK, DDR1, KDR, ACK, JAK1, LYNb, KIT, CSK, YES, KIT(V560G), BLK, MST1, JAK2, RET(S891A), SRC, FYN(isoform a), RET(G691S), FYN(isoform b), PDGFRβ, RET, FLT4, RET(Y791F), skMLCK, FRK, MST2, FLT1, AurA, FLT3, JAK3, RET(M918T), WNK3, p388, FGFR2, MNK1, MNK2, PIK3CA/PIK3R1, PDGFRα(D842V), MET, FGFR1, BRAF(V600E), MAP2K5, KIT(D816E), ALK, FGFR3, RAF1, MAP2K3, HER4, KIT(D816V), Erk5, EGFR, YES(T348I), KIT(V654A), KIT(D816Y), PDGFRα(T674I), BRAF, ABL, HER2, EPHA5, ROCK2, KIT(T670I), PKD3, MST4, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, MST3, ROCK1, IGF1R, PKD2, MAP2K6, Erk2, PKD1, MAP2K7, Erk1, MAP2K4, and BTK (see U.S. Pat. No. 8,470,818 B2 for detailed information on kinase nomenclature and biological properties). Aberrant kinase activity has been observed in many disease states including benign and malignant proliferative disorders as well as diseases resulting from inappropriate activation of the immune and nervous systems.
The novel compounds of this invention inhibit the activity of one or more protein kinases and are, therefore, expected to be useful in the treatment of kinase-related diseases or conditions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Definitions
As used herein the following definitions apply unless clearly indicated otherwise: By “chemical structure” or “chemical substructure” is meant any definable atom or group of atoms that constitute an individually identifiable portion of a molecule, such as a substituent moiety, a core which is optionally substituted, and the like. Normally, chemical substructures of a ligand can have a role in binding of the ligand to a target molecule, or can influence, the three-dimensional shape, electrostatic charge, and/or conformational properties of the ligand.
The term “prodrug” is a compound that, upon in vivo administration, is metabolized by one or more steps or processes or otherwise converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically, or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, the pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated by metabolic processes.
The term “binds” in connection with the interaction between a target and a potential binding compound indicates that the potential binding compound associates with the target to a statistically significant degree as compared to association with proteins generally (i.e., non-specific binding).
As used herein the term “modulating” or “modulate” refer to an effect of altering a biological activity, especially a biological activity associated with a particular biomolecule such as a protein kinase. For example, an agonist or antagonist of a particular biomolecule modulates the activity of that biomolecule, e.g., an enzyme, by either increasing (e.g. agonist, activator), or decreasing (e.g. antagonist, inhibitor) its activity. This type of activity is typically indicated in terms of an inhibitory concentration (IC50) for an inhibitor or an excitation concentration (EC50) for an activator.
As used herein in connection with compounds of the invention, the term “synthesizing” and like terms means chemical synthesis from one or more precursor materials. Further, by “assaying” is meant the creation of experimental conditions and the gathering of data regarding a particular result of the experimental conditions. For example, enzymes can be assayed based on their ability to act upon a detectable substrate. A compound or ligand can be assayed based on its ability to bind to a particular target molecule or molecules.
The term “lower alkyl” is art-recognized, and includes saturated aliphatic groups, including straight-chain alkyl groups and branched-chain alkyl groups. In certain embodiments, a straight-chain or branched-chain alkyl has about 6 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone (e.g., C1-C6 for straight chain, C3-C6 for branched chain).
The term “lower alkenyl” refers to an unsaturated straight or branched hydrocarbon having at least one carbon-carbon double bond, such as a straight or branched group 2 to 6 carbon atoms, referred to herein as C2-C6 alkenyl.
The term “cycloakyl” refers to a 3 to 7 membered monocyclic ring of aliphatic groups, including C3-C7, that is optionally substituted with alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyl, or optionally substituted amino, halogens, cyano (—CN), or nitro (—NO2).
The term “aryl” alone or in combination refers to a monocyclic or bicyclic ring system containing aromatic hydrocarbons such as phenyl or naphthyl, which may be optionally fused with a cycloalkyl of preferably 5 to 7 carbon atoms, more preferably 5 to 6 carbon atoms.
The term “heterocycloalkyl” refers to a saturated or unsaturated 5 non-aromatic cycloalkyl group having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms in which from 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the ring are replaced by heteroatoms of O, S, or N, and are optionally fused with benzo or heteroaryl of 5 to 6 ring members.
The term “alkoxyl” or “alkoxy” are art-recognized and refer to an alkyl group, as defined above, having an oxygen radical attached thereto. Representative alkoxyl groups include methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy tert-butoxy, and the like.
The term “substituted amines” moiety that may be represented as NR2 where R is independently hydrogen or alkyl.
“Halogen” refers to chloro (Cl), fluoro (F), bromo (Br), or iodo (I).
It is to be understood that the compounds provided herein may contain chiral centers. Such chiral centers may be of either the (R) or (S) configuration, or may be a mixture thereof. Thus, the compounds provided herein may be enantiomerically pure, or be stereoisomeric or diastereomeric mixtures.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means that the indicated material does not have properties that would cause a reasonably prudent medical practitioner to avoid administration of the material to a patient, taking into consideration the disease or condition to be treated and the respective route of administration. For example, it is commonly required that such a material be essentially sterile, e.g., for an injectable.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts that are non-toxic in the amounts and concentrations at which they are administered. The preparation of such salts can facilitate pharmacological use by altering the physical characteristics of a compound (solubility) without preventing it from exerting its physiological effect.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable composition” refers to a pharmaceutically active compound and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, and/or diluents.
The term “therapeutically effective amount” or “effective amount” is an amount of a preparation that alone, or together with further doses, produces the desired response. This may involve halting the progression of the disease or condition, delaying the onset of the disease or condition, or preventing the disease or condition from occurring, although it may also imply only temporarily slowing of the disease or condition.
The term “protein kinase-mediated disease or condition” refers to a disease or condition in which the biological function of a protein kinase affects the development, course, and/or symptoms of the disease or condition.
The term “mutants” refers to single or multiple amino acid changes in a protein as compared to the wild-type protein amino acid sequence.
Throughout the description and claims of this specification, the word “comprise” and variations of the word, such as “comprising” and “comprises,” means “including but not limited to,” and is not intended to exclude, for example, other additives, components, integers, or steps.

No. 8,470,818 B2 for detailed information about the above listed kinases).
Breast tumor related kinase (BRK), or protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) is a non-receptor type tyrosine kinase, cloned from a metastatic breast tumor, and overexpressed in a majority of breast cancers (Mizuguchi id.; Ono, H. et al. PTK6 Promotes Cancer Migration and Invasion in Pancreatic Cancer Cells Dependent on ERK Signaling. 2014, PLoS ONE 9(5): e96060. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0096060). BRK is composed of an amino-terminal SH3 domain, SH2 domain, and carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (Park, S. H. et al. PTK6 Inhibition Promotes Apoptosis of Lapatinib-Resistant Her2+ Breast Cancer Cells by Inducing Bim, Breast Cancer Research 2015, 17: 86, doi 10.1186/s13058-015-0594-z). BRK is expressed in many human cancers including breast, ovary, colon head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, prostate, lung, bladder, pancreas, and gastric, and lymphomas (Mizuguchi id.). BRK is only weakly expressed in normal mammary tissue or benign lesions (Mizuguchi id.). BRK has been shown to be activated downstream of various receptors in response to stimulation by their respective ligands such as EGF, HGF, and IGF (Goel, R. K. et al. Tracing the Footprints of the Breast Cancer Oncogene BRK—Past Till Present, Biochemica et Biophysics Acta 2015, 1656:39-54). Since the signaling pathways activated by these ligands tend to promote cell proliferation and migration, activation of BRK downstream in these signaling pathways is predicated to mechanistically contribute to the promotion of oncogenesis (Goal id.). Although the physiological function of BRK is dependent on its activation status, level of expression, intracellular localization, interaction with various signaling intermediates, and tumor stage or grade, ample evidence suggests that targeting BRK should provide therapeutic benefits in treating breast cancer (Goel id.). The oncogenic functions of BRK are reported to be mediated via its kinase activity, thus the development of clinical inhibitors of the BRK kinase domain should be an attractive therapeutic target (Goal id.).
In breast cancer, a 20-30% incidence of over expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor family tyrosine kinase ERBB2 (HER2, Neu) has been reported (Peng, M et al. Protein Tyrosine Kinase 6 Promotes ERBB2-induced Mammary Gland Tumorigenesis in the Mouse. Cell Death and Disease. 2015, 6:e1848; published online 6 Aug. 2015). Furthermore BRK expression, activation, and amplification of the BRK gene have been reported to occur in ERBB2/HER2-positive mammary gland cancers (Peng id.). The role of BRK (PTK6) to promote mammary gland tumorigenesis by activated ERBB2 was explored by Peng and co-workers using transgenic mice prepared by crossing PTK6 −/− mice with a mouse mammary tumor virus-ERBB2 transgenic mouse line expressing activated ERBB2. In mice lacking BRK, ERBB2-induced tumorigenesis was significantly delayed and diminished. BRK expression was induced in the mammary glands of ERBB2 transgenic mice before tumor development and correlated with activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and increased proliferation. Disruption of BRK-impaired STAT3 activation and proliferation. Additionally, phosphorylation of the BRK substrates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 1 (BCAR1; p130CAS) were decreased in BRK −/− mammary gland tumors. Reduced numbers of metastases were detected in the lungs of BRK −/− mice expressing activated ERBB2, compared with wild-type ERBB2 transgenic mice. These data support roles for BRK in both ERBB2-induced mammary gland tumor initiation and metastasis, and identify STAT3, FAK, and BCAR1 as physiologically relevant BRK substrates in breast cancer. This led the authors to conclude that including BRK inhibitors as part of a treatment regimen could have distinct benefits in ERBB2/HER2-positive breast cancers.
BRK is highly expressed in Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2+ (Her2+) breast cancers (Park id.). Park and co-workers investigated whether BRK inhibition is an effective strategy to inhibit growth and survival of Her2+ breast cancer cells, including those that are relatively resistant to Lapatinib, a targeted therapy for Her2+ breast cancer that developed either intrinsically or was acquired after continuous drug exposure. The authors reported that BRK down-regulation induces apoptosis of Lapatinib-resistant Her2(+) breast cancer cells by enhancing Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family member expressed via p38 activation. As Bim expression is a critical biomarker for response to many targeted therapies, BRK inhibition may offer a therapeutic approach to treating patients with Her2 targeted therapy-resistant breast cancers.
Recently, Mahmoud and co-workers reported the discovery of derivatives of pyrido[2,3-b]indole derivatives with 4-anilne and 6-substitutions as potent inhibitors of BRK and/or Her2 and described structure activity relationships (Mahmoud, K. A. Novel Inhibitors of Breast Cancer Relevant Kinases BRK and Her2. Med. Chem. Commun. 2014, 5:659-664). In a docking model developed by these researchers, the ATP-binding pocket in BRK was found to favor hydrophilic substituents. Mahmoud and co-workers further disclose a series of 4-anilinoa α-carbolines as novel Brk Inhibitors (Mahmoud, K. Z. et al. “Discovery of 4-Anilino α-Carbolines s Novel Brk inhibitors” Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2014, 24: 1948-1951). In conclusion, the presented series of 4-anilino α-carbolines turned out as a highly promising class of anticancer agents. The Brk inhibition depends on the kind and positioning of the aniline substituents which lead to nanomolar as well as to inactive inhibitors. The observed protein kinase inhibition profile documented a first selectivity of Brk inhibition. The correlation of Brk inhibition and mediated antiproliferative activity better than that of the reported lapatinib qualifies the new compound class for further preclinical studies (Mahmoud 2014 id.), Zeng et at disclose a group of novel imidazol [1,2a] pyrazin-8 amines as potent inhibitors of BRK and a computational model for inhibition of BRK (Zing, H. et at “Discovery of Novel Imidazo [1,2-a] Pyrazin-8-Amines as Brk/PTK6 inhibitors” Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2011, 21: 5870-5876). In addition, Several inhibitors, with single-digit nanomolar target engagement cell-based activity and an appealing overall DMPK profile, could be used as tool compounds to further validate Brk/PTK6 as a potential target for cancer treatment. None of these compounds have the chemical structure of formulas I, II, III, or IV, 200-17, 200-73, 200-93, 200-93a, 200-93b, 200-115, 200-117, 200-123, 200-139, or 200-149.
Ren, P. et al. disclose a series of compounds and compositions as protein kinase inhibitors including BRK inhibitors (US 2010/0048552 A1). The novel compounds inhibit one or more protein kinases and are, therefore, expected to be useful in treatment of kinase-mediated diseases or conditions. None of these compounds have the chemical structure of formulas I, II, III, or IV, 200-17, 200-73, 200-93, 200-93a, 200-93b, 200-115, 200-117, 200-123, 200-139, or 200-149.

Example 10
Cell growth assay with breast cancer cell line T-47D: T-47D (ATCC® HTB-133™) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.). T-47D cells grew in DMDM medium (Gibco, Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, Life Technologies) (complete medium) a T-75 flask at 37° C. under 5% CO2 with saturated humidity. When the cells were approximately 70-80% confluent, the culture medium was removed, the cell layer was rinsed with 10 mL Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS), and immediately following the treatment with 1 mL of 025% (w/v) Trypsin-EDTA solution at 37° C. for 5-15 min. A 9 mL aliquot of the complete medium was then gently dispersed over the surface of the cell layer for several times. The cell concentration was adjusted to 1×104 cells/mL with the complete medium. A 100 μL aliquot of the cell suspension was added to the well of a 96-well plate, and the plate was incubated overnight at 37° C. under 5% CO2 with saturated humidity. On the next day, the medium in each well was aspirated and replaced with a 100 μL aliquot of pre-warmed complete medium at 37° C. in the presence or absence of the test compounds at various concentrations from 0-100 μM. The test compounds were dissolved in DMSO, and the final DMSO concentration in the cell culture was no more than 1%. The plate was incubated for 72 hours at 37° C. under 5% CO2 with saturated humidity. At end of the cell culture, a 10 μL aliquot of PrestoBlue® Cell Viability reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) was added into the well, and the plate was incubated at 37° C. for 30 min. The absorption at 570 and 600 nm were measured with a SpectraMax Microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The absorbance at 570 nm was normalized to that at 600 nm. The normalized absorbance at 570 nm was used for IC50 calculation following the median-effect plot method (T. C. Chou, Pharmacol Rev 2006, 58: 621-681). The IC50 values for 200-17, 200-73, 200-93b, 200-115, 200-117, 200-123, 200-139 and 200-149 were less than 20 μM, while the IC50 value for 200-93a was greater than 20 μM.
