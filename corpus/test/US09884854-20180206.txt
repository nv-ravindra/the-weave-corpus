FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to novel N-[(Pyrimidinylamino)propanyl]- and N-[(Pyrazinylamino)-propanyl]arylcarboxamide derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy, particularly in the treatment or prevention of conditions having an association with the orexin sub-type 1 receptor.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Orexins are hypothalamic neuropeptides that play an important role in the regulation of many physiological behaviours such as arousal, wakefulness, appetite, food intake, cognition, motivated behaviours, reward, mood and stress. Orexin A, also referred to as hypocretin 1, is a peptide composed of 33 amino acids and orexin B, also referred to as hypocretin 2, is a peptide composed of 28 amino acids. Both are derived from a common precursor peptide referred to as pre-pro-orexin [Sakurai et al., Cell, 1998 Feb. 20; 92(4):573-85, and De Lecea et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 1998 Jan. 6; 95(1):322-7). Orexins bind to two orphan G-protein-coupled receptors, the orexin receptor type 1 (OX1R) and orexin receptor type 2 (OX2R), which are widely distributed in the central nervous system and peripheral organs such as adrenal glands, gonads, and gut. Whereas orexin A binds predominantly to OX1R, orexin B is able to bind to both OX1R and OX2R.
Orexins are involved in the regulation of a wide range of behaviours including for example the regulation of emotion and reward, cognition, impulse control, regulation of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions, arousal, vigilance and sleep-wakefulness states (Muschamp et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2014 Apr. 22; 111(16):E1648-55; for a recent review see Sakurai, Nat. Rev. Neurosci., 2014; November; 15(11):719-31; Chen et al., Med. Res. Rev., 2015; January; 35(1):152-97; Gotter et al., Pharmacol. Rev., 2012, 64:389-420 and many more).
Dual antagonism of OX1R and OX2R by small molecules is clinically efficacious in the treatment of insomnia, for which the drug suvorexant, [[(7R)-4-(5-chloro-1,3-benzoxazol-2-yl)-7-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl][5-methyl-2-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)phenyl]methanone] has been granted marketing authorisation (Kishi et al., PLoS One, 2015; 10(8):e0136910). The sleep-inducing effects of dual orexin receptor antagonists are predominantly mediated via OX2R (Bonaventure et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., March 2015, 352, 3, 590-601), whereas the other physiological states such as emotion and reward, cognition, impulse control, regulation of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions, arousal, and vigilance are rather mediated via OX1R.
Due to their sleep-inducing effects, dual OX1R and OX2R antagonists are not suitable for treating disorders related to impulse control deficits as seen in addictions such as substance use disorders, personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder, eating disorders such as binge eating disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Therefore, it is desirable to provide an OX1R selective antagonist for the treatment of impulse control deficits.
Orexin receptor antagonists of various structural classes are reviewed in Roecker et al. (J. Med. Chem. 2015, 59, 504-530). WO03/051872, WO2013/187466, WO2016/034882 and Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 2015, 23, 1260-1275 describe orexin receptor antagonists.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides novel N-[(Pyrimidinylamino)propanyl]- and N-[(Pyrazinylamino)-propanyl]arylcarboxamide derivatives that unexpectedly are highly potent OX1R antagonists (assay A) further characterized by
1) high selectivity over the OX2 receptor (assay B),
2) a medium to high stability in human liver microsomes (assay C), and
3) no or low MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) efflux (assay D).
Compounds of the present invention are superior to those disclosed in the prior art in terms of the combination of the following key pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters:
1) potency as OX1R antagonists,
2) selectivity over the OX2 receptor,
3) stability in human liver microsomes, and
4) MDCK efflux.
Stability in human liver microsomes refers to the susceptibility of compounds to biotransformation in the context of selecting and/or designing drugs with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. The primary site of metabolism for many drugs is the liver. Human liver microsomes contain the cytochrome P450s (CYPs), and thus represent a model system for studying drug metabolization in vitro. Enhanced stability in human liver microsomes is associated with several advantages, including increased bioavailability and longer half-life, which can enable lower and less frequent dosing of patients. Thus, enhanced stability in human liver microsomes is a favorable characteristic for compounds that are to be used for drugs.
The MDCK assay provides information on the potential of a compound to pass the blood brain barrier. Permeability measurements across polarized, confluent MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayers grown on permeable filter supports are used as an in vitro absorption model: apparent permeability coefficients (PE) of the compounds across the MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayers are measured (pH 7.4, 37° C.) in apical-to-basal (AB) and basal-to-apical (BA) transport direction. The AB permeability (PEAB) represents drug absorption from the blood into the brain and the BA permeability (PEBA) drug efflux from the brain back into the blood via both, passive permeability as well as active transport mechanisms mediated by efflux and uptake transporters that are expressed on the MDCK-MDR1 cells, predominantly by the overexpressed human MDR1 P-gp. Identical or similar permeabilities in both transport directions indicate passive permeation, vectorial permeability points to additional active transport mechanisms. Higher PEBA than PEAB (PEBA/PEAB>5) indicates the involvement of active efflux mediated by MDR1 P-gp, which might compromises the goal to achieve sufficient brain exposure. Therefore this assay provides valuable support for selection of compounds applicable for further in vivo testing. High permeability not limited by efflux at the blood brain barrier is a favourable characteristic for compounds that are to be used for drugs acting primarily in the CNS
Compounds of the present invention are though encompassed by formula I of WO03/051872, differ structurally from those explicitly disclosed therein in that
1) they contain a central N-ethyl-(propan-2-yl)amino moiety in place of the N-methyl-ethylamino, NH-ethylamino, or NH-(propan-2-yl)amino moiety, and
2) the left hand side moiety consists of a phenyl, pyridyl, pyrazyl or pyrimidyl group further substituted with a heteroaryl group in place of a thiazolyl group further substituted with a phenyl group. These structural differences unexpectedly result in higher potency, higher selectivity over the OX2R and enhanced stability in human liver microsomes than the structurally closest example explicitly disclosed in WO03/051872.
Compounds of the present invention differ structurally from those disclosed in WO2013/187466 in that they contain a (5-trifluoromethyl-pyrimidin-2-yl)-amino or (5-trifluoromethyl-pyrazin-2-yl)-amino moiety in place of a Het1-Het2 moiety in which Het2 is phenyl or pyridyl. These structural differences unexpectedly result in a higher selectivity over the OX2R and enhanced stability in human liver microsomes.
Compounds of the present invention differ structurally from Examples 91, 84, 90, 40, 73, 46 and 14 in WO2016/034882 (the closest prior art compounds) in that they contain a central N-ethyl-(propan-2-yl)amino moiety in place of the N-ethyl-[butan-2-yl]amino or N-methyl-[propan-2-yl]amino moiety. These structural differences unexpectedly result in a superior combination of the following key pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters:
1) potency as OX1R antagonists,
2) selectivity over the OX2 receptor,
3) stability in human liver microsomes, and
4) MDCK efflux.
Due to their high potency at OX1R and selectivity over OX2R, compounds of the present invention are expected to be both efficacious in in vivo models and to have a sufficient window between efficacy and undesired effects such as drowsiness or sleep.
Due to the superior combination of the key pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters (#1-4) compounds of the present invention are expected to demonstrate adequate brain exposure and to have a medium to low in vivo clearance and thus a longer duration of action and higher tolerability. Consequently, compounds of the present invention must be more viable for human use.

Activation of the orexin receptors expressed in cell lines results in an increase in intracellular IP3 concentration. IP1, a downstream metabolite of IP3, accumulates in cells following receptor activation and is stable in the presence of LiCl. Using Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence technology with Lumi4-Tb cryptate (commercially available from Cisbio Bioassay.) and a suitable fluorescence plate reader. This functional response is detectable and quantifiable as described in Trinquet et al. Anal. Biochem. 2006, 358, 126-135, Degorce et al. Curr. Chem. Genomics 2009, 3, 22-32. This technique is used to characterize pharmacological modification of the orexin receptors.
The biological activity of compounds is determined by the following methods:
A. In Vitro Testing of OX1R Potency: OX1R IP1
IP1 measurements are performed in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the full-length human Orexin 1 receptor and the aequorin photoprotein. Cells are cultivated in Ham's nutrient mixture F12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, in a 37° C., 95% humidity and 5% CO2 incubator. The CHO-K1/hOx1 cell mass is expanded to larger cell numbers. The cells are obtained as frozen cells in cryo-vials and stored until use at −150° C. The viability of the cells after thawing is >90%. In preparation for the assay, 24 hours before the assay, the cells are thawed at 37° C. and immediately diluted with cell culture medium. After centrifugation, the cell pellet is re-suspended in medium and then distributed into the assay plates with a density of 10000 cells/25 μL per well. The plates are incubated for one hour at room temperature to reduce edge effects before they are incubated for 24 hours at 37° C./5% CO2. Compounds are prepared by an 8-point serial dilution in DMSO and a final dilution step into assay buffer (HBSS with 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA and 50 mM LiCl, pH 7.4) to ensure a final DMSO concentration of 1% in the assay.
On the day of the assay, cells in the plate are washed twice with 60 μL assay buffer (20 μL buffer remained in the wells after washing), followed by adding 5 μL per well of compounds diluted in assay buffer. After 15 minutes of incubation at room temperature 5 μL per well of Orexin A peptide (final concentration: 0.5 nM, and/or 50 nM) dissolved in assay buffer is added to the assay plate. The assay plate is incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. Then 5 μl per well of Anti-IP1-Cryptate Tb solution and 5 μl per well of IP1-d2 dilution are added and the plate is incubated for a further 60 minutes light protected at room temperature. The emissions at 615 nm and 665 nm (Excitation wavelength: 320 nm) are measured using an EnVision reader (PerkinElmer). The ratio between the emission at 665 nm and 615 is calculated by the reader. 8-point four parametric non-linear curve fitting and determination of IC50 values and Hill slopes is performed using a regular analysis software e.g. AssayExplorer (Accelrys). In order to establish an agonist concentration independent parameter, Kb values are calculated using the following equation: IC50/((2+(A/EC50)n)1/n−1) (with A=concentration agonist, EC50=EC50 agonist, n=Hill slope agonist) (see P. Leff, I. G. Dougall, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993, 14(4), 110-112).
B. In Vitro Testing of OX2R Potency: OX2R IP1
IP1 measurements are performed in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the full-length human orexin 2 receptor and the aequorin photoprotein. Cells are cultivated in Ham's nutrient mixture F12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, in a 37° C., 95% humidity and 5% CO2 incubator. The CHO-K1/hOx2 cell mass is expanded to larger cell numbers. The cells are obtained as frozen cells in cryo-vials and stored until use at −150° C. The viability of the cells after thawing is >90%. In preparation for the assay, 24 hours before the assay, the cells are thawed at 37° C. and immediately diluted with cell culture medium. After centrifugation, the cell pellet is resuspended in medium and then distributed into the assay plates with a density of 5000 cells/25 μL per well. The plates are incubated for one hour at room temperature to reduce edge effects before they are incubated for 24 hours at 37° C./5% CO2. Compounds are prepared by a 8-point serial dilution in DMSO and a final dilution step into assay buffer (HBSS with 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA and 50 mM LiCl, pH 7.4) to ensure a final DMSO concentration of 1% in the assay. On the day of the assay, cells in the plate are washed twice with 60 μL assay buffer (20 μL buffer remained in the wells after washing), followed by adding 5 μL per well of compounds diluted in assay buffer. After 15 minutes of incubation at room temperature 5 μL per well of Orexin A peptide (final concentration: 0.5 nM) dissolved in assay buffer is added to the assay plate. The assay plate is incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. Then 5 μl per well of Anti-IP1-Cryptate Tb solution and 5 μl per well of IP1-d2 dilution are added to all well of the plate and the plate is incubated for a further 60 minutes light protected at room temperature. The emission at 615 nm and 665 nm (Excitation wavelength: 320 nm) are measured using an EnVision reader (PerkinElmer). The ratio between the emission at 665 nm and 615 is calculated by the reader.
8-point four parametric non-linear curve fitting and determination of IC50 values and Hill slopes is performed using a regular analysis software e.g. AssayExplorer (Accelrys). In order to establish an agonist concentration independent parameter, Kb values are calculated using the following equation: IC50/((2+(A/EC50)n)1/n−1) (with A=concentration agonist, EC50=EC50 agonist, n=Hill slope agonist) (see P. Leff, I. G. Dougall, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993, 14(4), 110-112).
Kb values from Assay A (OX1R) and Assay B (OX2R) can then provide a selectivity ratio which is independent of the agonist (Orexin A) concentration.
C. Assessment of Metabolic Stability in Human Liver Microsomes (Human MST)
The metabolic stability of the compounds according to the invention may be investigated as follows:
The metabolic degradation of the test compound is assayed at 37° C. with pooled human liver microsomes. The final incubation volume of 100 μL per time point contains TRIS buffer pH 7.6 at room temperature (0.1 M), MgCl2 (5 mM), microsomal protein (1 mg/mL) and the test compound at a final concentration of 1 μM. Following a short pre-incubation period at 37° C., the reactions are initiated by addition of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form (NADPH, 1 mM), and terminated by transferring an aliquot into solvent after different time points. After centrifugation (10000 g, 5 min), an aliquot of the supernatant is assayed by LC-MS/MS for the amount of parent compound. The half-life (t1/2) is determined by the slope of the semi-logarithmic plot of the concentration-time profile.
D. Assessment of Efflux in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) Cells Transfected with the Human MDR1 Gene
Apparent permeability coefficients (PE) of the compounds across the MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayers are measured (pH 7.4, 37° C.) in apical-to-basal (AB) and basal-to-apical (BA) transport direction. AB permeability (PEAB) represents drug absorption from the blood into the brain and BA permeability (PEBA) drug efflux from the brain back into the blood via both passive permeability as well as active transport mechanisms mediated by efflux and uptake transporters that are expressed on the MDCK-MDR1 cells, predominantly by the overexpressed human MDR1 P-gp. The compounds are assigned to permeability/absorption classes by comparison of the AB permeabilities with the AB permeabilities of reference compounds with known in vitro permeability and oral absorption in the human. Identical or similar permeabilities in both transport directions indicate passive permeation, vectorial permeability points to additional active transport mechanisms. Higher PEBA than PEAB indicates the involvement of active efflux mediated by MDR1 P-gp. Active transport is concentration-dependently saturable.
MDCK-MDR1 cells (1-2×10e5 cells/1 cm2 area) are seeded on filter inserts (Costar transwell polycarbonate or PET filters, 0.4 μm pore size) and cultured (DMEM) for 7 days. Subsequently, the MDR1 expression is boosted by culturing the cells with 5 mM sodium butyrate in full medium for 2 days. Compounds are dissolved in appropriate solvent (like DMSO, 1-20 mM stock solutions). Stock solutions are diluted with HTP-4 buffer (128.13 mM NaCl, 5.36 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 4.17 mM NaHCO3, 1.19 mM Na2HPO4×7H2O, 0.41 mM NaH2PO4×H2O, 15 mM HEPES, 20 mM glucose, 0.25% BSA, pH 7.4) to prepare the transport solutions (0.1-300 μM compound, final DMSO<=0.5%). The transport solution (TL) is applied to the apical or basolateral donor side for measuring A-B or B-A permeability (3 filter replicates), respectively. The receiver side contains the same buffer as the donor side. Samples are collected at the start and end of experiment from the donor and at various time intervals for up to 2 hours also from the receiver side for concentration measurement by HPLC-MS/MS or scintillation counting. Sampled receiver volumes are replaced with fresh receiver solution.

Comparison of Assays A and B with the Assays Described in WO2013/187466
Assays described in WO2013/187466 differ from assays A and B in:
The technology and readout: fluorescence measurement of intracellular Ca2+ changes (WO2013/187466) instead of luminescence measurement of IP1 (assays A and B)
Ox1R and Ox2R overexpressing cell lines used for the assays described in WO2013/187466 are of different origin as cell lines used for assays A and B
Use of modified orexin A (2 amino acids substituted) as agonist instead of orexin A
Agonist concentration of 300 μM used for the OX1R assay and 3 nM for the OX2R assay (EC75 vs. EC100; according to Okumura T. et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 2001) (WO2013/187466). IC50 values that have been reported are dependent on the agonist concentration. Selectivity ratios calculated from these IC50 values cannot be compared with the selectivity ratios calculated from the agonist concentration independent Kb values obtained from assay A and B.
Due to these differences between the assays, a direct comparison has to be established. Therefore, examples 69, 70 (the most selective ones) and 5 (one of the most potent ones) described in WO2013/187466 are tested in assays A and B so as to be directly compared with compounds of the present invention (see Table 2a).

Compounds of the Present Invention
Compounds of the present invention are more potent, more selective and more stable in human liver microsomes than the structurally most similar example, Example 6, disclosed in WO03/051872 (Table 1).
Compounds of the present invention are more selective over OX2R than preferred examples, Examples 5, 69 and 70, disclosed in WO2013/187466. Furthermore, they are more stable in human liver microsomes (Tables 2a and 2b).
A full and detailed comparison of the key biological properties (including OX1R and OX2R potencies, stability in human liver microsomes and MDCK efflux) of all compounds of the present invention with the corresponding closest prior art compounds in WO2016/034882 respectively is shown in Table 4.
Example 7 of the present invention differs structurally from Example 91 in WO2016/034882 i.e. the closest prior art compound in that it contains a central N-ethyl-(propan-2-yl)amino moiety in place of the N-methyl-[butan-2-yl]amino moiety. This structural difference unexpectedly results in Example 7 being 25-fold more potent at OX1R and more selective while being still in an acceptable range with regard to metabolic stability and MDCK efflux.
Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 18 are characterized by additional structural features thereby differing structurally farther from Example 91 in WO2016/034882 in that the phenyl group carries a different substituent or has a different substitution pattern. Example 14 has a further structural difference when compared to Example 91 in WO2016/034882, i.e. a methyl substituted oxadiazole group substitutes for the triazole moiety. Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 18 and 14 demonstrate a significantly higher potency in conjunction with higher selectivity along with adequate in vitro pharmacokinetic properties.
Examples 11, 13, 15 and 16 of the present invention differ structurally from Example 84 in WO2016/034882, i.e. the closest prior art compound in that they contain a) a central N-ethyl-(propan-2-yl)amino moiety in place of the N-methyl-[butan-2-yl]amino moiety and b) a fluorine-substituted phenyl ring instead of a methyl-substituted pyridyl ring. These structural differences unexpectedly result in Examples 11, 13, 15 and 16 demonstrating an at least 20-fold higher potency and higher selectivity in conjunction with good stability in human liver microsomes and low MDCK efflux.
Example 9 of the present invention differs structurally from Examples 46 and 73 in WO2016/034882, i.e. the closest prior art compound in that they contain a central N-ethyl-(propan-2-yl)amino moiety in place of the N-methyl-[butan-2-yl]amino moiety and N-ethyl-[butan-2-yl]amino moiety, respectively. These structural differences unexpectedly result in Example 9 demonstrating a >10 fold higher potency along with comparable selectivity and adequate pharmacokinetic properties when compared to Example 46 in WO2016/034882. Example 9 is superior to Example 73 in WO2016/034882 as well in that it possesses an approximately 3-fold higher potency and significantly improved stability in human liver microsomes.
Example 10 differs structurally farther from Examples 46 and 73 in WO2016/034882 in that the pyridine nitrogen is positioned differently and that the pyridine moiety is substituted with a fluorine instead of a methyl group. While having comparable potency and acceptable MDCK efflux, Example 10 surprisingly demonstrates higher selectivity and stability in human liver microsomes when compared to Examples 46 and 73 in WO2016/034882.
Example 12 of the present invention differs structurally from Example 90 in WO2016/034882, i.e. the closest prior art compound in that it contains a central N-ethyl-(propan-2-yl)amino moiety in place of the N-methyl-[butan-2-yl]amino moiety. Unexpectedly, Example 12 is superior to Example 90 in WO2016/034882 in that it demonstrates an at least 3 fold higher potency at OX1R with a lower selectivity though enhanced stability in human liver microsomes.
Examples 22, 23 and 24 of the present invention differ structurally from Example 40 in WO2016/034882, the closest prior art compound in that they contain a central N-ethyl-(propan-2-yl)amino moiety in place of the N-methyl-[butan-2-yl]amino moiety. Besides, they possess a differently substituted phenyl group. Furthermore, Example 23 contains a methyl-oxadiazole moiety instead of the triazole one. Examples 22, 23 and 24 are significantly more stable in human liver microsomes and perform within the same potency range or even well beyond when compared to Example 40 in WO2016/034882.
Examples 17, 19, 20 and 21 of the present invention differ structurally from Example 14 in WO2016/034882, i.e. the closest prior art compound in that they contain a central N-ethyl-(propan-2-yl)amino moiety in place of the N-methyl-(propan-2-yl)amino moiety. Furthermore, they include a) a methylpyrimidine, pyridine, pyrimidine or pyrazine moiety instead of a phenyl group and b) a 5-trifluoromethylpyrimidine moiety instead of a 5-chloropyridyl group. Unexpectedly, Examples 17, 19, 20 and 21 are of higher selectivity and markedly higher stability (in human liver microsomes) than Example 14 in WO2016/034882.
These results demonstrate that unexpectedly, compounds of the present invention are superior to the structurally most similar examples disclosed in WO2016/034882 (closest prior art compounds) respectively in at least one of the following key pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters including potency, selectivity, stability in human liver microsomes and MDCK efflux.
