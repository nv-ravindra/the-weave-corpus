FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The field of the invention pertains to compounds that are inhibitors of a Janus kinase, such as JAK1, as well as compositions containing these compounds, and methods of use including, but not limited to, diagnosis or treatment of patients suffering from a condition responsive to the inhibition of a JAK kinase.
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
Cytokine pathways mediate a broad range of biological functions, including many aspects of inflammation and immunity. Janus kinases (JAK), including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, are cytoplasmic protein kinases that associate with type I and type II cytokine receptors and regulate cytokine signal transduction. Cytokine engagement with cognate receptors triggers activation of receptor associated JAKs and this leads to JAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and ultimately transcriptional activation of specific gene sets (Schindler et al., 2007, J. Biol. Chem. 282: 20059-63). JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 exhibit broad patterns of gene expression, while JAK3 expression is limited to leukocytes. Cytokine receptors are typically functional as heterodimers, and as a result, more than one type of JAK kinase is usually associated with cytokine receptor complexes. The specific JAKs associated with different cytokine receptor complexes have been determined in many cases through genetic studies and corroborated by other experimental evidence. Exemplary therapeutic benefits of the inhibition of JAK enzymes are discussed, for example, in International Application No. WO 2013/014567.
JAK1 was initially identified in a screen for novel kinases (Wilks A. F., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:1603-1607). Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that JAK1 is functionally and physically associated with the type I interferon (e.g., IFNalpha), type II interferon (e.g., IFNgamma), and IL-2 and IL-6 cytokine receptor complexes (Kisseleva et al., 2002, Gene 285:1-24; Levy et al., 2005, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 3:651-662; O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). JAK1 knockout mice die perinatally due to defects in LIF receptor signalling (Kisseleva et al., 2002, Gene 285:1-24; O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). Characterization of tissues derived from JAK1 knockout mice demonstrated critical roles for this kinase in the IFN, IL-10, IL-2/IL-4 and IL-6 pathways. A humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 pathway (Tocilizumab) has been approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (Scheinecker et al., 2009, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 8:273-274).
CD4 T cells play an important role in asthma pathogenesis through the production of TH2 cytokines within the lung, including IL-4, IL-9 and IL-13 (Cohn et al., 2004, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 22:789-815). IL-4 and IL-13 induce increased mucus production, recruitment of eosinophils to the lung, and increased production of IgE (Kasaian et al., 2008, Biochem. Pharmacol. 76(2): 147-155). IL-9 leads to mast cell activation, which exacerbates the asthma symptoms (Kearley et al., 2011, Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med., 183(7): 865-875). The IL-4Rα chain activates JAK1 and binds to either IL-4 or IL-13 when combined with the common gamma chain or the IL-13Rα1 chain respectively (Pernis et al., 2002, J. Clin. Invest. 109(10):1279-1283). The common gamma chain can also combine with IL-9Rα to bind to IL-9, and IL-9Rα activates JAK1 as well (Demoulin et al., 1996, Mol. Cell Biol. 16(9):4710-4716). While the common gamma chain activates JAK3, it has been shown that JAK1 is dominant over JAK3, and inhibition of JAK1 is sufficient to inactivate signaling through the common gamma chain despite JAK3 activity (Haan et al., 2011, Chem. Biol. 18(3):314-323). Inhibition of IL-4, IL-13 and IL-9 signaling by blocking the JAK/STAT signaling pathway can alleviate asthmatic symptoms in pre-clinical lung inflammation models (Mathew et al., 2001, J. Exp. Med. 193(9): 1087-1096; Kudlacz et. al., 2008, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 582(1-3): 154-161).
Biochemical and genetic studies have shown an association between JAK2 and single-chain (e.g., EPO), IL-3 and interferon gamma cytokine receptor families (Kisseleva et al., 2002, Gene 285:1-24; Levy et al., 2005, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 3:651-662; O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). Consistent with this, JAK2 knockout mice die of anemia (O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). Kinase activating mutations in JAK2 (e.g., JAK2 V617F) are associated with myeloproliferative disorders in humans.
JAK3 associates exclusively with the gamma common cytokine receptor chain, which is present in the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 cytokine receptor complexes. JAK3 is critical for lymphoid cell development and proliferation and mutations in JAK3 result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). Based on its role in regulating lymphocytes, JAK3 and JAK3-mediated pathways have been targeted for immunosuppressive indications (e.g., transplantation rejection and rheumatoid arthritis) (Baslund et al., 2005, Arthritis & Rheumatism 52:2686-2692; Changelian et al., 2003, Science 302: 875-878).
TYK2 associates with the type I interferon (e.g., IFNalpha), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23 cytokine receptor complexes (Kisseleva et al., 2002, Gene 285:1-24; Watford, W. T. & O'Shea, J. J., 2006, Immunity 25:695-697). Consistent with this, primary cells derived from a TYK2 deficient human are defective in type I interferon, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23 signalling. A fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the shared p40 subunit of the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines (Ustekinumab) was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (Krueger et al., 2007, N. Engl. J. Med. 356:580-92; Reich et al., 2009, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 8:355-356). In addition, an antibody targeting the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways underwent clinical trials for treating Crohn's Disease (Mannon et al., 2004, N. Engl. J. Med. 351:2069-79).
Currently there remains a need for additional compounds that are inhibitors of Janus kinases. For example, there is a need for compounds that possess useful potency as inhibitors of one or more Janus kinases (e.g., JAK1) in combination with other pharmacological properties that are necessary to achieve a useful therapeutic benefit. For example, there is a need for potent compounds that demonstrate selectivity for one Janus kinase over other kinases in general. There is also a need for potent compounds that demonstrate selectivity for one Janus kinase over other Janus kinases (e.g., selectivity for JAK1 over other Janus kinases). Kinases demonstrating selectivity for JAK1 could provide a therapeutic benefit, with fewer side effects, in conditions responsive to the inhibition of JAK1. Additionally there is currently a need for potent JAK1 inhibitors that possess other properties (e.g., melting point, pK, solubility, etc.) necessary for formulation and administration by inhalation. Such compounds would be particularly useful for treating conditions such as, for example, asthma.

A “sterile” formulation is aseptic or free from all living microorganisms and their spores.
“Stereoisomers” refer to compounds that have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. Stereoisomers include diastereomers, enantiomers, conformers and the like.
“Chiral” refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term “achiral” refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.
“Diastereomer” refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g., melting points, boiling points, spectral properties or biological activities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography such as HPLC.
“Enantiomers” refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.
Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., “Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds”, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (−) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (−) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms “racemic mixture” and “racemate” refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.
The term “tautomer” or “tautomeric form” refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.
Certain compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. A “solvate” refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the present invention.
Examples of solvents that form solvates include water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. Certain compounds of the invention can exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. The term “hydrate” refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.
A “metabolite” refers to a product produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt thereof. Such products can result, for example, from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound.
Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g., 14C or 3H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to a human, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.
“Amino-protecting group” as used herein refers to a derivative of the groups commonly employed to block or protect an amino group while reactions are carried out on other functional groups on the compound. Examples of such protecting groups include carbamates, amides, alkyl and aryl groups, and imines, as well as many N-heteroatom derivatives which can be removed to regenerate the desired amine group. Particular amino protecting groups are Pmb (p-Methoxybenzyl), Boc (tert-Butyloxycarbonyl), Fmoc (9-Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) and Cbz (Carbobenzyloxy). Further examples of these groups are found in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, “Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1999. The term “protected amino” refers to an amino group substituted with one of the above amino-protecting groups.
“Carboxy-protecting group” as used herein refers to those groups that are stable to the conditions of subsequent reaction(s) at other positions of the molecule, which may be removed at the appropriate point without disrupting the remainder of the molecule, to give the unprotected carboxy-group. Examples of carboxy protecting groups include, ester groups and heterocyclyl groups. Ester derivatives of the carboxylic acid group may be employed to block or protect the carboxylic acid group while reactions are carried out on other functional groups on the compound. Examples of such ester groups include substituted arylalkyl, including substituted benzyls, such as 4-nitrobenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl, 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzyl, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl, pentamethylbenzyl, 3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl, benzhydryl, 4,4′-dimethoxybenzhydryl, 2,2′,4,4′-tetramethoxybenzhydryl, alkyl or substituted alkyl esters such as methyl, ethyl, t-butyl allyl or t-amyl, triphenylmethyl (trityl), 4-methoxytrityl, 4,4′-dimethoxytrityl, 4,4′,4″-trimethoxytrityl, 2-phenylprop-2-yl, thioesters such as t-butyl thioester, silyl esters such as trimethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl esters, phenacyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, beta-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl, beta-(di(n-butyl)methylsilyl)ethyl, p-toluenesulfonyl ethyl, 4-nitrobenzyl sulfonylethyl, allyl, cinnamyl, 1-(trimethylsilylmethyl)prop-1-en-3-yl, and like moieties. Another example of carboxy-protecting groups are heterocyclyl groups such as 1,3-oxazolinyl. Further examples of these groups are found in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, “Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1999. The term “protected carboxy” refers to a carboxy group substituted with one of the above carboxy-protecting groups.
“Hydroxy-protecting group” as used herein refers to a derivative of the hydroxy group commonly employed to block or protect the hydroxy group while reactions are carried out on other functional groups on the compound. Examples of such protecting groups include tetrahydropyranyloxy, benzoyl, acetoxy, carbamoyloxy, benzyl, and silylethers (e.g., TBS, TBDPS) groups. Further examples of these groups are found in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, “Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1999. The term “protected hydroxy” refers to a hydroxy group substituted with one of the above hydroxy-protecting groups.
Compounds of the invention may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms. Accordingly, the compounds may exist as diastereomers, enantiomers or mixtures thereof. The syntheses of the compounds may employ racemates, diastereomers or enantiomers as starting materials or as intermediates. Mixtures of particular diastereomeric compounds may be separated, or enriched in one or more particular diastereomers, by chromatographic or crystallization methods. Similarly, enantiomeric mixtures may be separated, or enantiomerically enriched, using the same techniques or others known in the art. Each of the asymmetric carbon or nitrogen atoms may be in the R or S configuration and both of these configurations are within the scope of the invention.
In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined. Unless otherwise specified, if solid wedges or dashed lines are used, relative stereochemistry is intended.
Another aspect includes prodrugs of the compounds of the invention including known amino-protecting and carboxy-protecting groups which are released, for example hydrolyzed, to yield the compound of the present invention under physiologic conditions.
The term “prodrug” refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less efficacious to the patient compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically or hydrolytically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, e.g., Wilman, “Prodrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy” Biochemical Society Transactions, 14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast (1986) and Stella et al., “Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,” Directed Drug Delivery, Borchardt et al., (ed.), pp. 247-267, Humana Press (1985). Prodrugs include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated prodrugs, P3-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, and 5-fluorocytosine and 5-fluorouridine prodrugs.
A particular class of prodrugs are compounds in which a nitrogen atom in an amino, amidino, aminoalkyleneamino, iminoalkyleneamino or guanidino group is substituted with a hydroxy group, an alkylcarbonyl (—CO—R) group, an alkoxycarbonyl (—CO—OR), or an acyloxyalkyl-alkoxycarbonyl (—CO—O—R—O—CO—R) group where R is a monovalent or divalent group, for example alkyl, alkylene or aryl, or a group having the Formula —C(O)—O—CP1P2-haloalkyl, where P1 and P2 are the same or different and are hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy, cyano, halogen, alkyl or aryl. In a particular embodiment, the nitrogen atom is one of the nitrogen atoms of the amidino group of the compounds of the invention. Prodrugs may be prepared by reacting a compound of the present invention with an activated group, such as acyl groups, to bond, for example, a nitrogen atom in the compound to the exemplary carbonyl of the activated acyl group. Examples of activated carbonyl compounds are those containing a leaving group bonded to the carbonyl group, and include, for example, acyl halides, acyl amines, acyl pyridinium salts, acyl alkoxides, acyl phenoxides such as p-nitrophenoxy acyl, dinitrophenoxy acyl, fluorophenoxy acyl, and difluorophenoxy acyl. The reactions are generally carried out in inert solvents at reduced temperatures such as −78 to about 50° C. The reactions may also be carried out in the presence of an inorganic base, for example potassium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate, or an organic base such as an amine, including pyridine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, triethanolamine, or the like.
Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance, a free carboxyl group of a compound of the invention can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example, compounds of the invention comprising free hydroxy groups can be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as, but not limited to, a phosphate ester, hemisuccinate, dimethylaminoacetate, or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group, as outlined in Fleisher, D. et al., (1996) Improved oral drug delivery: solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 19:115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group can be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem., (1996), 39:10. More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (C1-C6)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C1-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C1-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C1-C6)alkoxycarb onyloxymethyl, N—(C1-C6)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C1-C6)alkanoyl, alpha-amino(C1. C4)alkanoyl, arylacyl and alpha-aminoacyl, or alpha-aminoacyl-alpha-aminoacyl, where each alpha-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH)2, —P(O)(O(C1-C6)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).
“Leaving group” refers to a portion of a first reactant in a chemical reaction that is displaced from the first reactant in the chemical reaction. Examples of leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halogen atoms, alkoxy and sulfonyloxy groups. Example sulfonyloxy groups include, but are not limited to, alkylsulfonyloxy groups (for example methyl sulfonyloxy (mesylate group) and trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy (triflate group)) and arylsulfonyloxy groups (for example p-toluenesulfonyloxy (tosylate group) and p-nitrosulfonyloxy (nosylate group)).
A “subject,” “individual,” or “patient” is a vertebrate. In certain embodiments, the vertebrate is a mammal.

In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount of a chemical entity described herein sufficient to significantly decrease the activity or number of B-cells. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) or determining the response rate (RR).
“Treatment” (and variations such as “treat” or “treating”) refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, compounds of the invention, are used to delay development of a disease or disorder or to slow the progression of a disease or disorder. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder, (for example, through a genetic mutation) or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.
“Inflammatory disorder” refers to any disease, disorder or syndrome in which an excessive or unregulated inflammatory response leads to excessive inflammatory symptoms, host tissue damage, or loss of tissue function. “Inflammatory disorder” also refers to a pathological state mediated by influx of leukocytes or neutrophil chemotaxis.
“Inflammation” refers to a localized, protective response elicited by injury or destruction of tissues, which serves to destroy, dilute, or wall off (sequester) both the injurious agent and the injured tissue. Inflammation is notably associated with influx of leukocytes or neutrophil chemotaxis. Inflammation can result from infection with pathogenic organisms and viruses and from noninfectious means such as trauma or reperfusion following myocardial infarction or stroke, immune responses to foreign antigens, and autoimmune responses. Accordingly, inflammatory disorders amenable to treatment with a compound of the present invention, such as a compound of Formula (I), (I-I), (I-II), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (le), (If), (Ig), (Ih), (i), (Ij), (Im), (In), (Io), (Ip), or (Iq), or a compound of Table 1 or 2, encompass disorders associated with reactions of the specific defense system as well as with reactions of the nonspecific defense system.
“Specific defense system” refers to the component of the immune system that reacts to the presence of specific antigens. Examples of inflammation resulting from a response of the specific defense system include the classical response to foreign antigens, autoimmune diseases, and delayed type hypersensitivity responses mediated by T-cells. Chronic inflammatory diseases, the rejection of solid transplanted tissue and organs, e.g., kidney and bone marrow transplants, and graft versus host disease (GVHD), are further examples of inflammatory reactions of the specific defense system.
The term “nonspecific defense system” refers to inflammatory disorders that are mediated by leukocytes that are incapable of immunological memory (e.g., granulocytes, and macrophages). Examples of inflammation that result, at least in part, from a reaction of the nonspecific defense system include inflammation associated with conditions such as adult (acute) respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ injury syndromes; reperfusion injury; acute glomerulonephritis; reactive arthritis; dermatoses with acute inflammatory components; acute purulent meningitis or other central nervous system inflammatory disorders such as stroke; thermal injury; inflammatory bowel disease; granulocyte transfusion associated syndromes; and cytokine-induced toxicity.
“Autoimmune disease” refers to any group of disorders in which tissue injury is associated with humoral or cell-mediated responses to the body's own constituents. Non-limiting examples of autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and multiple sclerosis.
“Allergic disease” as used herein refers to any symptoms, tissue damage, or loss of tissue function resulting from allergy. “Arthritic disease” as used herein refers to any disease that is characterized by inflammatory lesions of the joints attributable to a variety of etiologies. “Dermatitis” as used herein refers to any of a large family of diseases of the skin that are characterized by inflammation of the skin attributable to a variety of etiologies. “Transplant rejection” as used herein refers to any immune reaction directed against grafted tissue, such as organs or cells (e.g., bone marrow), characterized by a loss of function of the grafted and surrounding tissues, pain, swelling, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. The therapeutic methods of the present invention include methods for the treatment of disorders associated with inflammatory cell activation.
“Inflammatory cell activation” refers to the induction by a stimulus (including, but not limited to, cytokines, antigens or auto-antibodies) of a proliferative cellular response, the production of soluble mediators (including but not limited to cytokines, oxygen radicals, enzymes, prostanoids, or vasoactive amines), or cell surface expression of new or increased numbers of mediators (including, but not limited to, major histocompatability antigens or cell adhesion molecules) in inflammatory cells (including but not limited to monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, granulocytes (i.e., polymorphonuclear leukocytes such as neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils), mast cells, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and endothelial cells). It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the activation of one or a combination of these phenotypes in these cells can contribute to the initiation, perpetuation, or exacerbation of an inflammatory disorder.
In some embodiments, inflammatory disorders which can be treated according to the methods of this invention include, but are not limited to, asthma, rhinitis (e.g., allergic rhinitis), allergic airway syndrome, atopic dermatitis, bronchitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and delayed hypersensitivity reactions.
The terms “cancer” and “cancerous”, “neoplasm”, and “tumor” and related terms refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A “tumor” comprises one or more cancerous cells. Examples of cancer include carcinoma, blastoma, sarcoma, seminoma, glioblastoma, melanoma, leukemia, and myeloid or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g., epithelial squamous cell cancer) and lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”), adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung. Other cancers include skin, keratoacanthoma, follicular carcinoma, hairy cell leukemia, buccal cavity, pharynx (oral), lip, tongue, mouth, salivary gland, esophageal, larynx, hepatocellular, gastric, stomach, gastrointestinal, small intestine, large intestine, pancreatic, cervical, ovarian, liver, bladder, hepatoma, breast, colon, rectal, colorectal, genitourinary, biliary passage, thyroid, papillary, hepatic, endometrial, uterine, salivary gland, kidney or renal, prostate, testis, vulval, peritoneum, anal, penile, bone, multiple myeloma, B-cell lymphoma, central nervous system, brain, head and neck, Hodgkin's, and associated metastases. Examples of neoplastic disorders include myeloproliferative disorders, such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, myelofibrosis, such as primary myelofibrosis, and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
A “chemotherapeutic agent” is an agent useful in the treatment of a given disorder, for example, cancer or inflammatory disorders. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents are well-known in the art and include examples such as those disclosed in U.S. Publ. Appl. No. 2010/0048557, incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, chemotherapeutic agents include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, acids or derivatives of any of chemotherapeutic agents, as well as combinations of two or more of them.
“Package insert” is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.
Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms.

Isotopically-labeled compounds (e.g., those labeled with 3H and 14C) can be useful in compound or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., 3H) and carbon-14 (i.e., 14C) isotopes can be useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements). In some embodiments, in compounds of the invention, one or more carbon atoms are replaced by 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon. Positron emitting isotopes such as 15O, 13N, 11C, and 18F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes or in the Examples herein, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.
It is specifically contemplated that any limitation discussed with respect to one embodiment of the invention may apply to any other embodiment of the invention.
Furthermore, any compound or composition of the invention may be used in any method of the invention, and any method of the invention may be used to produce or to utilize any compound or composition of the invention.
The use of the term “or” is used to mean “and/or” unless explicitly indicated to refer to alternatives only or the alternative are mutually exclusive, although the disclosure supports a definition that refers to only alternatives and “and/or.”

Synthesis of Janus Kinase Inhibitor Compounds
Compounds of the invention may be synthesized by synthetic routes described herein. In certain embodiments, processes well-known in the chemical arts can be used, in addition to, or in light of, the description contained herein. The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, Wis.) or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis, v. 1-19, Wiley, N.Y. (1967-1999 ed.), Beilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie, 4, Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available via the Beilstein online database)), or Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, Editors Katrizky and Rees, Pergamon Press, 1984.
Compounds may be prepared singly or as compound libraries comprising at least 2, for example 5 to 1,000 compounds, or 10 to 100 compounds. Libraries of compounds may be prepared by a combinatorial ‘split and mix’ approach or by multiple parallel syntheses using either solution phase or solid phase chemistry, by procedures known to those skilled in the art. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound library comprising at least 2 compounds of the invention, such as a compound of Formula (I), (I-I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (le), (If), (Ig), (Ih), (Ii), (Ij), (Im), (In), (Io), (Ip), or (Iq), or a compound of Table 1 or 2.
For illustrative purposes, reaction Schemes below provide routes for synthesizing the compounds of the invention as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps, see the Examples section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used. Although some specific starting materials and reagents are depicted in the Schemes and discussed below, other starting materials and reagents can be substituted to provide a variety of derivatives or reaction conditions. In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art.
In the preparation of compounds of the invention, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzyl, phenylsulfonyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991.
Other conversions commonly used in the synthesis of compounds of the invention, and which can be carried out using a variety of reagents and conditions, include the following:
(1) Reaction of a carboxylic acid with an amine to form an amide. Such a transformation can be achieved using various reagents known to those skilled in the art but a comprehensive review can be found in Tetrahedron, 2005, 61, 10827-10852.
(2) Reaction of a primary or secondary amine with an aryl halide or pseudo halide, e.g., a triflate, commonly known as a “Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling,” can be achieved using a variety of catalysts, ligands and bases. A review of these methods is provided in Comprehensive Organic Name Reactions and Reagents, 2010, 575-581.
(3) A palladium cross-coupling reaction between an aryl halide and a vinyl boronic acid or boronate ester. This transformation is a type of “Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling,” a class of reaction that has been thoroughly reviewed in Chemical Reviews, 1995, 95(7), 2457-2483.
(4) The hydrolysis of an ester to give the corresponding carboxylic acid is well known to those skilled in the art and conditions include: for methyl and ethyl esters, the use of a strong aqueous base such as lithium, sodium or potassium hydroxide or a strong aqueous mineral acid such as HCl; for a tert-butyl ester, hydrolysis would be carried out using acid, for example, HCl in dioxane or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dichloromethane (DCM).
As shown in Scheme 1, compounds of type 8 may be accessed starting with compounds of type 1. Reduction of the nitro group present in 1 produces compound 2. Compound 2 may be reacted under appropriate conditions such as Buchwald-Hartwig type conditions with an aryl halide or aryl halide equivalent such as 3 to produce compounds of type 4. Compound 4 may be deprotected under acidic conditions to produce compounds of type 5, which may then be reacted with appropriate electrophiles such as tert-butyl 2-bromoacetate to provide compounds of type 6. Treatment of 6 with acidic conditions liberates the free acid 7, which may then be coupled with amines under standard conditions to provide amide compounds of type 8.
As shown in Scheme 2, compounds of type 6 may be accessed by starting with compounds of type 1. The X group may be comprised of the moieties listed at the bottom of Scheme 2. Hydrolysis of 1 can provide compounds of type 2, which may then be coupled with appropriate amines under standard conditions to provide amide compounds of type 3. Deprotection of 3 under acidic conditions provides compounds of type 4, which can then be reacted under appropriate conditions such as Buchwald-Hartwig type conditions with an aryl halide or aryl halide equivalent such as 5 to produce compounds of type 6.
As shown in Scheme 3, compounds of type 5, 6, 7, and 8 may be accessed by starting with compounds of type 1 and 2. The X group may be comprised of the moieties listed at the bottom of Scheme 3. Reaction of compounds of type 2 under appropriate conditions such as Buchwald-Hartwig type conditions with an aryl halide or aryl halide equivalent such as 1 can produce compounds of type 3. Treatment of 3 with acidic conditions liberates the free amine present in compound 4. Reaction of amine 4 under various electrophilic conditions (with a subsequent reduction step in the case of reductive amination) produces compounds of type 5, 6, 7, and 8.
As shown in Scheme 4, compounds of type 6 may be accessed by starting with compounds of type 1. The X group may be comprised of the moieties listed at the bottom of Scheme 4. Reduction of ketones of type 1 produces alcohols of type 2. Alkylation of 2 produces compounds of type 3. Treatment of 3 with acidic conditions liberates free amines of type 4. Reaction of compounds of type 4 under appropriate conditions such as Buchwald-Hartwig type conditions with an aryl halide or aryl halide equivalent such as 5 can produce compounds of type 6.
As shown in Scheme 5, compounds of type 5, 6, 7, and 8 may be accessed by starting with compounds of type 2. Reaction of compounds of type 2 under appropriate conditions such as Suzuki type conditions with an aryl halide or aryl halide equivalent such as 1 can produce compounds of type 3. Treatment of 3 with acidic conditions can liberate amine compounds of type 4, which can then be reacted under various electrophilic conditions to produce compounds of type 5, 6, and 7. Compounds of type 5 may further be treated with hydrogenation conditions such as hydrogen gas in the presence of palladium on activated carbon to produce compounds of type 8.
Substitution on ring A of Formula (I) may be accomplished using techniques known in the art. See, e.g., WO 2015/032286 and references cited therein.
As shown in Scheme 6, compounds of type 5 may be accessed by starting with compounds of type 1. The X group may be comprised of the moieties listed at the bottom of Scheme 6. Reductive amination of ketones of type 1 with R3NH2 produce amines of type 2. Treatment of 3 under acidic conditions liberates free amines of type 3. Reaction of compounds of type 3 under appropriate conditions such as Buchwald-Hartwig type conditions with an aryl halide or aryl halide equivalent such as 4 can produce compounds of type 5.

Using procedures similar to those described herein, compounds of Table 1 were prepared. In Table 1, certain chemical structures may be shown more than once, for example, see Examples 190-191, 192-193, and 197-198. It is understood that these separate Examples represent single diastereomers that have been separated as shown in Table 2, wherein the absolute stereochemistry of each diastereomer has not been elucidated.
Enzymatic Assays
JAK Enzyme Assays were Carried Out as Follows:
The activity of the isolated recombinant JAK1 and JAK2 kinase domain was measured by monitoring phosphorylation of a peptide derived from JAK3 (Val-Ala-Leu-Val-Asp-Gly-Tyr-Phe-Arg-Leu-Thr-Thr, fluorescently labeled on the N-terminus with 5-carboxyfluorescein) using the Caliper LabChip® technology (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, Mass.). To determine inhibition constants (Ki), compounds were diluted serially in DMSO and added to 50 μL kinase reactions containing purified enzyme (1.5 nM JAK1, or 0.2 nM JAK2), 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.2), 0.015% Brij-35, 1.5 μM peptide substrate, ATP (25 μM), 10 mM MgCl2, 4 mM DTT at a final DMSO concentration of 2%. Reactions were incubated at 22° C. in 384-well polypropylene microtiter plates for 30 minutes and then stopped by addition of 25 μL of an EDTA containing solution (100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.2), 0.015% Brij-35, 150 mM EDTA), resulting in a final EDTA concentration of 50 mM. After termination of the kinase reaction, the proportion of phosphorylated product was determined as a fraction of total peptide substrate using the Caliper LabChip® 3000 according to the manufacturer's specifications. Ki values were then determined using the Morrison tight binding model (Morrison, J. F., Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 185:269-296 (1969); William, J. W. and Morrison, J. F., Meth. Enzymol., 63:437-467 (1979)) modified for ATP-competitive inhibition [Ki=Ki,app/(1+[ATP]/Km,app)].
JAK1 Pathway Assay in Cell Lines was Carried Out as Follows:
Inhibitor potency (EC50) was determined in cell-based assays designed to measure JAK1 dependent STAT phosphorylation. As noted above, inhibition of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-9 signalling by blocking the Jak/Stat signaling pathway can alleviate asthmatic symptoms in pre-clinical lung inflammation models (Mathew et al., 2001, J Exp Med 193(9): 1087-1096; Kudlacz et. al., 2008, Eur J. Pharmacol 582(1-3): 154-161). In one assay approach, TF-1 human erythroleukemia cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, Va.) were used to measure JAK1-dependent STAT6 phosphorylation downstream of IL-13 stimulation. Prior to use in the assays, TF-1 cells were starved of GM-CSF overnight in OptiMEM medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) supplemented with 0.5% charcoal/dextran stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (NEAA), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. The assays were run in 384-well plates in serum-free OptiMEM medium using 300,000 cells per well. In a second assay approach, BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells obtained from ATCC were plated at 100,000 cells per well of a 96-well plate one day prior to the experiment. The BEAS-2B assay was run in complete growth medium (bronchial epithelial basal medium plus bulletkit; Lonza; Basel, Switzerland).
Test compounds were serially diluted 1:2 in DMSO and then diluted 1:50 in medium just before use. Diluted compounds were added to the cells, for a final DMSO concentration of 0.2%, and incubated for 30 min (for the TF-1 assay) or 1 hr (for the BEAS-2B assay) at 37° C. Then, cells were stimulated with human recombinant cytokine at their respective EC90 concentrations, as previously determined for each individual lot. Cells were stimulated with IL-13 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) for 15 min at 37° C. The TF-1 cell reactions were stopped by the direct addition of 10× lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, Mass.), whereas the BEAS-2B cell incubations were halted by the removal of medium and addition of 1× lysis buffer. The resultant samples were frozen in the plates at −80 OC. Compound mediated inhibition of STAT6 phosphorylation was measured in the cell lysates using MesoScale Discovery (MSD) technology (Gaithersburg, Md.). EC50 values were determined as the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of STAT phosphorylation relative to that measured for the DMSO control.
