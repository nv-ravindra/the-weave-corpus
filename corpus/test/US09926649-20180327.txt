TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure is generally related to fibers containing carbon nanotubes.
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART
High-performance synthetic fibers have been under development for the past half century, motivated in particular by the high strength and stiffness of the covalent carbon-carbon bond and by the ability to achieve alignment with the fiber axis where they are in the form of polymer molecules or graphene sheets. Optimally, one may maximize the number of covalently bonded carbon atoms per unit volume or mass (high average molecular weight) and thus other types of atoms or groups attached to polymer chains will tend to reduce ultimate properties. An advantage of pure carbon fibers is that the mechanical properties are derived from the in-plane stiffness and strength of graphene sheets, without the adulterating effect of additional atoms to satisfy available carbon bonds. However, the route to carbon fibers involves the alignment of precursor structures, which are then covalently bonded to each other to create the final structure. Carbon fibers are thus comparatively brittle, especially when they are heat treated above 1500° C. to maximize stiffness. The very high axial strength and stiffness of individual carbon nanotubes opens up the possibility of processing them directly into continuous fibers. Thus, the benefits of high-performance polymeric fibers, especially directness of processing and fiber toughness, can be combined with the advantages of nanofibers consisting of carbon atoms. The processing routes developed so far to incorporate CNTs into polymeric fibers borrow concepts from polymer fiber processing technologies.
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN), petroleum pitch, and cellulosic fibers are typically used as carbon fiber precursors. Other high temperature polymers have also been used. Currently, PAN is the precursor of choice. For converting PAN to carbon and carbon nanotube fibers, thermo-oxidative stabilization typically in the 200-300° C. range is a key step. The PAN fibers are fed through a series of specialized ovens during the time-consuming oxidative stage. The process combines oxygen molecules from the air with the PAN fibers in the warp and causes the polymer chains to start crosslinking. The crosslinked fibers then have a definite shaped (will not soften) and are then carbonized under inert conditions typically between 700 and ends in a high temperature furnace at 1200° C. to 1500° C. While dwell times are sometimes proprietary, oxidative dwell time is measured in hours, while carbonization is an order of magnitude shorter, measured in minutes. As the fiber is carbonized, it loses weight and volume, contracts by 5 to 10 percent in length and shrinks in diameter.
There are two main methods for fiber production, namely, liquid and solid state spinning. Both methods have been developed for CNT-based fibers. Increased thermal stability, glass transition temperature, and storage modulus have been reported with the incorporation of carbon nanotubes in various polymer matrices. Poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO)/CNT composite fibers containing 10 wt-% CNTs exhibited 50% higher tensile strength compared to the controlled PBO fiber. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) copolymers are commercially important and are used as carbon fiber precursors as well as for the development of porous and activated carbon for a variety of applications. Films have been made from PAN/MWNT homogeneous dispersions. The CNTs can be dispersed in solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylacetamide (DMAC). Carbonized and activated PAN/CNT films are very promising for supercapacitor electrode applications. Solution spun PAN/CNT fibers containing 10 wt-% nanotubes exhibit a 100 percent increase in tensile modulus at room temperature, a significant reduction in thermal shrinkage, and a 40° C. increase in the glass transition temperature. These observations provide evidence of the interaction between PAN and the CNTs.
One parameter in making high-strength fibers from carbon nanotubes is the availability of nanotubes which are as long and as structurally perfect as possible. Another parameter is to align all nanotubes as perfectly as possible with the fiber axis, so as to maximize the translation of their axial properties to those of the fiber. The bonding between adjacent nanotubes is weak in shear (graphite is a lubricant) and thus as great a contact length as possible is necessary to transfer the load into any given nanotube. Another advantage of thin walled nanotubes (single or double) is that they tend to facet or flatten so to maximize their contact area. Alignment is typically achieved through mechanical forces whether applied to a partly linked array of fibers or through fluid-flow forces on a lyotropic suspension.
Today, there is currently an intense effort throughout the scientific community to efficiently disperse MWNTs into polymeric fibers to take advantage of the exceptional mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes. Moreover, various research groups have used aerogels and fuming sulfuric acid to utilize the CNTs grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in the formation of CNT containing fibers. Carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) have been the dominant reinforcement in advanced composites since their commercialization in the late 1960s. By using a resin such as PAN, which can be spun into a fiber, cured, and then carbonized, the formation of CNT fibers can be exploited using the NRL breakthrough method for the formation of CNTs by heating the PAN or other carbon sources in the presence of small metal nanoparticles that may be magnetic in nature.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present subject matter may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these specific details. In other instances, detailed descriptions of well-known methods and devices are omitted so as to not obscure the present disclosure with unnecessary detail.
A high-yield method has been developed for the production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanotube-magnetic metal nanoparticle compositions in a bulk carbonaceous solid. The yield of CNT formation can be controlled as a function of the carbonization temperature and exposure time at elevated temperatures. With this method, CNTs are formed in a bulk carbonaceous solid from thermal decomposition of various amounts of an organometallic compound and/or metal salts in the presence of an excess amount of a carbon source such as selected highly aromatic compounds. Only a small amount of the organometallic compound or metal salt is needed to achieve the formation of CNTs in high yield, but larger quantities of the metal source can also be incorporated, if desired.
The disclosed process is concerned with the formation of neat aligned CNT fibers from precursor compositions formulated from (1) a carbon source such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN) or copolymers thereof, pitch-based compounds, high temperature compounds or resins that char and (2) a metal salt(s) and/or organometallic compound(s). The spinning of fibers occurs from the precursor compositions either melted or dissolved or dispersed in a dipolar aprotic solvent, and thermal treatment of the precursor composition resulting in the decomposition of the metal salt and/or organometallic compounds into metal nanoparticles that behave as the catalyst for the formation of the CNTs. Heat treatment at, for example, 200-400° C. is important to convert the polymeric fibers to a form with retention of structural integrity for heating to elevated temperatures and for conversion of the fibers above, for example, 500° C. to metal nanoparticle/carbon nanotube fibers during a carbonization process. The carbonization process to form the carbon nanotube fibers occurs in temperature steps from, for example, about 600° C. to 1500° C. The property of the carbon nanotube fibers will depend on the heat treatment.
The process may result in the high-yield formation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in the solid carbonaceous domain upon heat treatment to elevated temperatures under ambient pressure. The method permits the large-scale inexpensive production of MWNTs in a shaped, solid configuration. The MWNTs are formed under atmospheric pressure during the carbonization process above 500° C. in the carbonaceous solid. The catalytic metal atoms, nanoclusters, and/or nanoparticles formed from the decomposition of the organometallic compound or metal salt are the key to the formation of the carbon nanotubes in the developing carbonaceous nanomaterial by reacting with the developing polycondensed aromatic ring system. To date, the average size as determined by X-ray diffraction studies are 5-30 nm. Small metal nanoparticles (1-3 nm) could produce single-walled carbon nanotubes. The composition can be tailored to have mainly CNTs or varying amounts of CNTs and magnetic metal nanoparticles, as formed. Shaped solid forms, films, and fibers/rods can be readily formulated from the precursor mixtures. If desired, CNT-containing powders can be obtained by milling of the carbonaceous solid. The CNT content of the bulk solid can be controlled by the final pyrolysis temperature. For example, a final pyrolysis temperature of 800° C. and 1300° C. may afford a CNT content of approximately 20 and 70 wt. %, respectively. A suitable range of pyrolysis temperatures includes, but is not limited to, 600-2700° C.
The initial fiber form of the initial materials may be made by a variety of methods that are known in the art including, but not limited to, spinning with a spinneret, electro spinning, solvent precipitation, and physically pulling a fiber from a mixture of the materials. A variety of such methods are described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/301,279. The materials may be mixed neat in the melt or liquid state, or mixed or dissolved in a solvent. When the precursor composition is completely dissolved in a solvent, it can help to ensure that metal salt(s) and/organometallic compounds are deposited within the spun polymeric fibers. The fiber is a threadlike material and may have the same dimensions as is typical for other carbon fibers.
The polymer or resin may be dissolved in a solution simultaneously, before, or after dissolving the transition metal compound. The transition metal compound may be dissolved close in time to the production of the fiber from the same solution. This may be done to avoid decomposition of certain transition metal compounds, such as Co2(CO)8. Such decomposition may occur gradually over time, particularly if exposed to air or elevated temperatures. The fibers may be produced when at least 50%, 70%, or 90% of the original amount of the transition metal compound still remains in the solution without having decomposed. For example, the solution may be spun into fibers within 30 days of dissolving the transition metal compound in the solution. A polar aprotic solvent may be used for dissolving both components. Such solvents are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and N-methylpyrrolidone. Any concentration of transition metal compound that results in the formation of carbon nanotubes may be used, including concentrations higher and lower than used in the examples below.
Suitable carbon sources include aromatic polymers and precursors thereof. The polymer may be a crosslinked or thermoset polymer, with the crosslinking occurring during or after formation of the fiber. The aromatic polymer may be an aromatic phthalonitrile polymer or oligomer, or a thermoset thereof, such as a phthalonitrile oligomer made from bisphenol A and benzophenone. A precursor is a compound or material that can be converted to an aromatic polymer or material by heating before forming the CNTs. Such heating may be in oxygen, including atmospheric air. The heating may be, for example, from 200-300° C. When heated in this way, PAN converts to an aromatic polymer as the side groups form rings. Pitch resins such as coal pitch (coal tar pitch), petroleum pitch, or synthetic pitches also form aromatic materials. Other suitable carbon sources include any aromatic material, or material that converts to an aromatic, that forms a char when heated in an inert atmosphere. Such materials and their products are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,673,953; 6,770,583; 6,846,345; 6,884,861; and 7,819,938.
The transition metal compound may be, for example, a metal salt or an organometallic compound. Such compounds can decompose at elevated temperatures to form metal nanoparticles. Such suitable compounds include, but are not limited to, octacarbonyldicobalt, 1-(ferrocenylethynyl)-3-(phenylethynyl)benzene, diironnonacarbonyl, and bis(1,5-cyclooctodiene)nickel(0).
The small metal nanoparticles, formed by thermal degradation/decomposition of the metal salt(s) and/or organometallic compounds, are responsible for the formation of the CNTs within the carbonized fiber upon heat treatment to elevated temperatures. The precursor polymeric fibers (carbon source and metal salt) may be carbonized by the simple carbonization process already used to produce carbon and graphitic fibers.
The precursor compositions such as polyacrylonitrile, phthalonitriles, petroleum pitches, etc. and metal salts and/or organometallic compound are mixed and heated to cause the decomposition of the metal component into metal atoms, clusters, and/or metal nanoparticles (controlling the metal particle size to less than 25 nm). The small metal nanoparticles are responsible for and catalyze the formation of the CNTs. Large metal nanoparticles larger than 40 nm in size may afford graphite; thus it may be important to keep the metal catalyst at much smaller sizes. Stretching may help to align the molecules within the small diameter sized fibers and provides the basis for the formation of the tightly bonded carbon crystals after carbonization and the means for aligning the CNTs within the fibers.
Carbon nanotube fibers may be fabricated by injecting a solution of a precursor composition formulated from a carbon source-metal salt and/organometallic compound into a protic solvent such as water, by drawing from the melt of a B-staged thermoset resin at elevated temperatures or by conventional spinning techniques of a carbon precursor followed by carbonization of the polymeric fibers formed by the listed methods of preparation. In an effort to develop a method for the fabrication of CNT fibers formulated directly from the precursor carbon material, experiments have been conducted whereby fibers were drawn from the melt of a Fe2(CO)9/phthalonitrile precursor composition and by the deposition of a fiber into water from a solution of Fe2(CO)9/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and a dipolar aprotic solvent. The polymeric fibers were used in the direct formation of the carbon nanotube (MWNT) fibers by slowly heating to 1000° C. under inert conditions. Studies show that any CNT precursor composition formulation from a carbon source and a metal salt(s) and/or organometallic compound that can be spun or drawn into a fiber and carbonized by the method can be converted into carbon nanotube fibers. There are no known prior reports of the ability to achieve the direct formation of CNT fibers using a simple carbonization process from precursor materials such as PAN and petroleum pitches that are currently used to form carbon and graphitic fibers. To show the feasibility of forming CNT fibers, large diameter fibers and rods were formed from a phthalonitrile oligomer and PAN and converted into CNT large fibers and rods (see FIG. 1 ).
Since the formation of CNTs can occur directly from a mixture of a metal salt such as Fe2(CO)9, Co2(CO)8, and nickel(cyclooctadiene) and carbon sources such as PAN or phthalonitriles in a shaped composition including large diameter fibers and rods, these precursor compositions are suitable candidates to spin polymeric fibers that can be directly converted into MWNT-fibers during the carbonization process. The fibers may also contain various quantities of magnetic metal nanoparticles depending upon the initial concentration of the metal salt(s) or organometallic compound(s) in the precursor composition. The photographs (see FIG. 1 ) show carbon nanotube fibers obtained from PAN (top) and phthalonitrile (bottom). Upon cure and carbonization of the polymeric fibers, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies confirmed the presence of copious amounts of MWNTs in the carbonized fibers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (see FIGS. 2 and 3 ) show that the CNTs can be potentially aligned within small diameter sized fibers (micron- and nanometer-sized fibers). No stretching of the fibers/rod was performed during these experiments.
The formation and heat treatment of the fibers may be similar to method known in the art for that of the same materials in the absence of the transition metal compound. A variety of such methods are described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/301,279.
The resulting fiber may have at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, or 80 wt. % CNTs. The CNTs may be generally aligned parallel with each other and the length of the fiber. The fiber may also contain metal nanoparticles. However, if heated to a high enough temperature the metal nanoparticles may be removed. These properties also apply to nanofiber sheets.
Many potential applications have been proposed for carbon nanotubes, including conductive and high-strength composites; energy storage and energy conversion devices; sensors; field emission displays and radiation sources; hydrogen storage media; and nanometer-sized semiconductor devices, probes, high electrical current flow, and interconnects. Some of these applications are now realized in products. Another potential application is use is in garments, such as anti-ballistic and decontamination garments. The small diameter sized, high surface area CNT fibers would be expected to exhibit superior mechanical, electrical, magnetic, catalytic, and optical properties. Potential payoffs and impact areas of the CNT fibers include structural, motor/generator, energy (fuel cell electrodes, Li-batteries, hydrogen storage, and electricity carrier—electrically conductive carbon nanotubes), membrane for water purification, air filtration (toxin removal), and various catalytic applications. Metal nanoparticles also present in the fibers could be of importance for many of these applications.

The white fibers/tows are stabilized in air to convert the polymer into a conjugated system that is expected to retain its structural integrity during carbonization and graphitization.

AR pitch fibers produced by Example 65 are stabilized to a thermoset by heating between 250-350° C. in an air atmosphere for 5-60 min. The fibers are oxidatively heated so that they will not soften when heated to carbonization and the fibers should be totally infusible so they will not sag during carbonization.

AR pitch thermosetting fibers produced by Example 66 are carbonized by heating up to 2000° C. in an inert (helium) atmosphere and holding from 5-30 min. Carbon nanotubes are expected to grow in situ within the fibers along with other carbonaceous materials. As carbon nanotubes were observed in Examples 34 and 35 on solid sample and fibers pulled from the melt and carbonized under similar conditions, fibers formed by this procedure using a spinneret (Example 65) should contain carbon nanotubes with the yield dependent on the carbonization temperature. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy studies are used to analyze the fibers for the carbon nanotubes.

AR pitch fibers produced by Example 68 are stabilized to a thermoset by heating between 250-350° C. in an air atmosphere for 5-60 min. The fibers are oxidatively heated so that they will not soften when heated to carbonization and the fibers should be totally infusible so they will not sag during carbonization.

Carbon nanotubes are expected to grow in situ within the fibers along with other carbonaceous materials. As carbon nanotubes were observed in Examples 34 and 35 on solid sample and fibers pulled from melt and carbonized under similar conditions, small diameter fiber formed by this procedure should also have carbon nanotubes with the yield dependent on the carbonization temperature. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy studies are used to analyze the fibers for the carbon nanotubes.
