The present invention relates to an improved method for the production of phosphorodiamidites, that allow to obtain phosphorodiamidites that may especially be used in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.
Phosphorodiamidites are well known compounds, that are in particular used as intermediates in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, e.g. in the manufacture of anti-neoplastic agents.
However, to be suitable for use in such industries, phosphorodiamidites must be of high purity (typically of at least 99% by 31P NMR). This is especially significant for 2-Cyanoethyl N,N,N′,N′-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite of formula (NC—C2H4—O—P—(—NiPr2)2, which is a commercially important intermediate in the synthesis of oligonucleotides.
A method for obtaining phosphorodiamidites having a relatively high purity has been disclosed in WO 2004/058779, said method comprising (1) reacting a phosphorus trihalide with a dialkyl amine in a polar solvent to form an intermediate compound and (2) subsequently reacting the intermediate compound with a hydroxyalkyl compound and a dialkyl amine, in the presence of a non-polar co-solvent, which leads to:
a precipitation of the salt produced in the first step E1 (iPr2NH2+Cl− in the case of 2-Cyanoethyl N,N,N′,N′-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite); and
a reaction of the intermediate compound with an hydroxyl compound, typically cyanoethanol, in the presence of a non-polar co-solvent, which produces:
a salt (iPr2NH2+Cl− in the case of 2-Cyanoethyl N,N,N′,N′-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite), that precipitates.
the sought phosphorodiamidite (2-Cyanoethyl N,N,N′,N′-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite, for example) obtained in solution, separated from the solid, having a relatively high purity, typically of at least 96%.
One aim of the instant invention is to provide a method that allow to obtain phosphorodiamidites of higher purity.
To this end, the invention proposes to make use of the method of WO 2004/058779, but with a preliminary step of purification of the reactants, that especially allows to eliminate alcohol impurities present in the diallkylamine (for example the isopropanol impurities that are present in diisopropylamine, in the case of the preparation of 2-Cyanoethyl N,N,N′,N′-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite).
More precisely, according to a first aspect, one subject-matter of the instant invention is a method for preparing a phosphorodiamidite, from a dialkylamine containing impurities including at least an alcohol, that comprises the following steps:
(E1) a purified solution of the dialkyl amine in a polar solvent is prepared as follows:
(E1.1.) the dialkylamine dissolved in a polar solvent is contacted with a quantity of phosphorus trihalide that is sufficient to react with the alcohol impurities contained in the dialkylamine, and optionally with other impurities contained in the dialkylamine or in the polar solvent, but sufficiently low to leave a major part of the dialkylamine unreacted, whereby a mixture is obtained that contains the dialkylamine in the polar solvent and reaction products of the impurities with the phosphorous trihalide;
(E1.2.) the unreacted dialkylamine and polar solvent present in the mixture obtained in step (E1.1.) are extracted from the solution S by their difference of volatility, typically by distillation, whereby the purified solution of the dialkyl amine in the polar solvent is obtained;
(E2) the purified solution of dialkyl amine in a polar solvent as obtained in step (E1) is reacted with a phosphorus trihalide, whereby an intermediate compound is formed;
(E3) the intermediate compound obtained in step (E2) is reacted with a hydroxyalkyl compound in the presence of a non-polar co-solvent, optionally together with a suitable amine base.
In the scope of the instant invention, the inventors have now made evident that the above step (E1) inhibits the formation of by-products in steps (E2) and (E3) that are otherwise extremely difficult to eliminate after the reactions of step (E2) and (E3).
As a consequence, the process of the invention allows to obtain purified phosphorodiamidite that cannot be obtained according to another method. According to another specific aspect, a subject-matter of the instant invention is the highly purified phosphorodiamidites as obtained by the process of the invention.
Especially, starting from diisoproylamine comprising isopropanol as an impurity, the process of the instant invention allows to obtain purified 2-Cyanoethyl N,N,N′,N′-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite that is free from iPr—O—P—(N-iPr2)2 impurity.
The use of steps (E1), (E2) and (E3) according to the invention may further allows a reduction of other side products linked to the presence of other impurities than alcohol in the reactants. Step (E1) actually leads to a reduction of the content of impurities that my react with the phosphorus trihalide. Especially, step (E1) allows to reduce the content of usual impurities present in dialkyl amines, including for example isomers of the used dialkyl amine. For example, in the specific case if diisopropyl amine, step (E1) eliminates all or part N-ethyl, N-isopropylamine and N-(1-propyl), N-isopropyl amine that are commonly present as impurities.
Whatever the exact nature of the reactants used in step (E&), (E2) and (E3) and of the impurities that they contain, the phosphorus trihalide used according to the instant invention is preferably phosphorus trichloride PCl3. Alternatively, the phosphorus trihalide used according to the instant invention may also be phosphorus tribromide PBr3. Generally (but not necessarily), the phosphorus trihalide used in step (E1) and the phosphorus trihalide used in step (E2) are the same (typically PCl3 in the to steps).
The dialkyl amine used according to the invention is preferably diisopropylamine, e.g. containing isopropanol as an impurity (typically the used diisopropylamine contains isopropanol and N-ethyl, N-isopropyl amine and N-(1-propyl), N-isopropyl amine as impurities). In that case, the prepared phosphorodiamidite is typically 2-Cyanoethyl N,N,N′,N′-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite.
Alternatively the dialkyl amine may be dimethylamine, diethylamine, di-n-propylamine, di-n-butylamine, di-isobutylamine or di-tert-butylamine.
Whatever its nature, the dialkyl amine used according to the invention may include various proportion of impurities (especially at least one alcohol and optionally other impurities). The process of the invention allows use of any alkylamine, whatever the content of impurities. Depending on this content, only one parameter has to be adapted, namely the quantity of phosphorus trihalide to be used in step (E1), that should be sufficiently small to let a major part of the dialkyl amine unreacted (by “major part”, it should be understood that preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 90%, and even more preferably at least 95% of the dialkylamine is let unreacted in step E1—this is however preferable for economical reason only, and the high purity may be obtained for lower content of unreacted dialkylamine).
The polar solvent used according to the invention is preferably a nitrile compound, in particular, acetonitrile. Alternatively the polar solvent may be propionitrile or benzonitrile.
The hydroxyalkyl compound is preferably hydroxypropionitrile. Alternatively the hydroxyalkyl compound may be methanol, tert-butyl alcohol or other suitable hydroxyalkyl compounds which are known to be suitable for the manufacture of phosphorodiamidites.
The alkane co-solvent is preferably heptane or hexane. Other suitable C5 to C9 aliphatic hydrocarbons include pentane. Suitable alicyclic hydrocarbons include, for example, cyclohexane.
The ratio of polar solvent to non-polar solvent may typically be from 5:1 to 1:5 and is generally around 1:1 (for example from 2:1 to 1:2).
The process of the invention is typically carried out in dry conditions and under inert atmosphere.
The method according to the invention provides a phosphorodiamidite compound according to Formula I:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
(R2N)2—P—O(CH2)n—CN  (I)
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
wherein R is a C1 to C4 alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or oxyalkyl group; and n is a whole number of from 1 to 4.
The compound according to formula I is preferably 2-cyanoethyl tetraisopropyl phosphorodiamidite wherein R is isopropyl, and n=2.
The present invention also provides the use of a compound of formula I in the synthesis of oligonucleotides.
The invention will now be illustrated by the following examples.
