BACKGROUND
Thymidylate metabolism is required for producing essential building blocks necessary to replicate DNA in dividing cells and has long been an important therapeutic target for cornerstone cancer drugs. Drugs targeting this pathway such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) inhibit the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) and are currently critical standard-of care therapies. TS-targeted agents are heavily used for the treatment of a variety of cancers including colon, gastric, head and neck, breast, lung and blood related malignancies among others. Grem, J. L., 5-Fluorouracil plus leucovorin in cancer therapy, in Principals and Practice of Oncology Update Series, J. De Vita, V. T., S. Hellman, and A. Rosenberg, Editors. 1988, J.B. Lippincott: Philadelphia, Pa.
There are two classes of drugs that target the TS enzyme: the fluoropyrimidines and the antifolates. The fluoropyrimidines, 5 FU, S-1 and capecitabine (Xeloda®), have wide use in the treatment of gastrointestinal and breast cancers, while the antifolate pemetrexed (Alimt®) is currently used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Since the discovery of 5-FU over fifty years ago by Charles Heidelberger, the fluoropyrimidines remain one of the most common and effective anticancer cancer drugs used worldwide. Due to this fact, there is an abundance of clinical experience and insight into the mechanism of action of these agents.
The TS inhibitor 5-fluorouracil (5 FU) remains the foundation of many first and second line regimens in the treatment of colon cancer. Single agent therapies including oxaliplatin, irinotecan, Erbitux and Avastin, demonstrate lowered activity in colon cancer as compared to 5-FU. In addition to colon cancer, TS-directed agents have demonstrated efficacy in several other solid tumor types.
Deoxyuridine triphosphatase (“dUTPase”) is a ubiquitous enzyme that is essential for viability in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms; as the main regulator of dUTP pools, the expression of dUTPase could have profound effects on the utility of chemotherapeutics that inhibit thymidylate biosynthesis. Normally, dUTPase mediates a protective role by limiting the expansion of dUTP pools and countering the cytotoxic effect of uracil misincorporation. According to this model, elevated levels of dUTPase could prevent TS inhibitor-induced dUTP accumulation and induce drug resistance. It has been shown that dUTPase over expression results in a significant decrease in dUTP accumulation and increased resistance to drug treatment when compared to controls.
Chemotherapeutic agents that target de novo thymidylate metabolism are critical for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors, however clinical efficacy is often hindered by drug resistance. Because resistance to these agents is a common occurrence, the identification and exploitation of novel determinants of drug sensitivity within this pathway of proven therapeutic utility is important. As disclosed by Ladner et al. in U.S. Patent Publ. No. US 2011/0212467 (“Ladner”), uracil-DNA misincorporation pathway can play a driving role in mediating cytotoxicity to TS-directed chemotherapies.
For example, nearly half of cancer patients do not benefit from 5-FU-based treatment due to intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. Due to this fact, there is a critical need to overcome the fundamental challenge of drug resistance and provide new therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcome. This disclosure satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well.

An “effective amount” is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations, applications or dosages. Such delivery is dependent on a number of variables including the time period for which the individual dosage unit is to be used, the bioavailability of the therapeutic agent, the route of administration, etc. It is understood, however, that specific dose levels of the therapeutic agents disclosed herein for any particular subject depends upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, bioavailability of the compound, the route of administration, the age of the animal and its body weight, general health, sex, the diet of the animal, the time of administration, the rate of excretion, the drug combination, and the severity of the particular disorder being treated and form of administration. In general, one will desire to administer an amount of the compound that is effective to achieve a serum level commensurate with the concentrations found to be effective in vivo. These considerations, as well as effective formulations and administration procedures are well known in the art and are described in standard textbooks. Consistent with this definition and as used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” is an amount sufficient to treat a specified disorder or disease or alternatively to obtain a pharmacological response such as inhibiting dUTPase.
As used herein, “treating” or “treatment” of a disease in a patient refers to (1) preventing the symptoms or disease from occurring in an animal that is predisposed or does not yet display symptoms of the disease; (2) inhibiting the disease or arresting its development; or (3) ameliorating or causing regression of the disease or the symptoms of the disease. As understood in the art, “treatment” is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. For the purposes of this technology, beneficial or desired results can include one or more, but are not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms, diminishment of extent of a condition (including a disease), stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of a condition (including disease), delay or slowing of condition (including disease), progression, amelioration or palliation of the condition (including disease), states and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable.
“dUTPase” means any of the following, which are considered to be synonymous, “deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase”, “deoxyuridine triphosphate pyrophosphatase”, “dUTP nucleotidohydrolase”, “dUTP pyrophosphatase”, and other equivalent nomenclature for the dUTPase enzyme. In one aspect, dUTPase intends DUT-N and DUT-M. In other aspects, it is DUT-N only, or alternatively, DUT-M only. The amino acid and coding sequences for dUTPase are known in the art and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,246. Methods for expressing and screening for expression level of the enzyme are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,246 and Ladner et al. (US Patent Publ. No. 2011/0212467A1).
“DUT-N” means the nuclear form of dUTPase.
“DUT-M” means the mitochondrial or cytoplasmic form of dUTPase.
“dUTPase-directed therapy” intends therapeutics that target the dUTPase pathway, e.g., in the case of cancer, e.g. TS-directed therapies and the fluoropyrimidines (such as 5-FU), pemetrexed (Alimta®), capecitabine (Xeloda®), S-1 and antifolates (such as methotrexate) and chemical equivalents thereof. Non-limiting examples include 5-flurouracil (5-FU), TS-directed therapies and 5-FU based adjuvant therapy. Combination therapies can include any intervention that alters nucleotide pools and/or sensitizes the immune cells or viruses to the dUTPase inhibitor, as are well known to the skilled artisan. For rheumatoid arthritis, for example, the combination can be with an dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor such as methotrexate.
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) belongs to the family of therapy drugs called pyrimidine based anti-metabolites. It is a pyrimidine analog, which is transformed into different cytotoxic metabolites that are then incorporated into DNA and RNA thereby inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Chemical equivalents are pyrimidine analogs which result in disruption of DNA replication. Chemical equivalents inhibit cell cycle progression at S phase resulting in the disruption of cell cycle and consequently apoptosis. Equivalents to 5-FU include prodrugs, analogs and derivative thereof such as 5′-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (doxifluoroidine), 1-tetrahydrofuranyl-5-fluorouracil (ftorafur), capecitabine (Xeloda®), S-1 (MBMS-247616, consisting of tegafur and two modulators, a 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine and potassium oxonate), ralititrexed (tomudex), nolatrexed (Thymitaq, AG337), LY231514 and ZD9331, as described for example in Papamicheal (1999) The Oncologist 4:478-487.
“5-FU based adjuvant therapy” refers to 5-FU alone or alternatively the combination of 5-FU with other treatments, that include, but are not limited to radiation, methyl-CCNU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, irinotecin, mitomycin, cytarabine, levamisole. Specific treatment adjuvant regimens are known in the art as FOLFOX, FOLFOX4, FOLFIRI, MOF (semustine (methyl-CCNU), vincrisine (Oncovin®) and 5-FU). For a review of these therapies see Beaven and Goldberg (2006) Oncology 20(5):461-470. An example of such is an effective amount of 5-FU and Leucovorin. Other chemotherapeutics can be added, e.g., oxaliplatin or irinotecan.
Capecitabine is a prodrug of (5-FU) that is converted to its active form by the tumor-specific enzyme PynPase following a pathway of three enzymatic steps and two intermediary metabolites, 5′-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5′-DFCR) and 5′-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5′-DFUR). Capecitabine is marketed by Roche under the trade name Xeloda®.
Leucovorin (Folinic acid) is an adjuvant used in cancer therapy. It is used in synergistic combination with 5-FU to improve efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent. Without being bound by theory, addition of Leucovorin is believed to enhance efficacy of 5-FU by inhibiting thymidylate synthase. It has been used as an antidote to protect normal cells from high doses of the anticancer drug methotrexate and to increase the antitumor effects of fluorouracil (5-FU) and tegafur-uracil. It is also known as citrovorum factor and Wellcovorin. This compound has the chemical designation of L-Glutamic acid N[4[[(2-amino-5-formyl1,4,5,6,7,8hexahydro4oxo6-pteridinyl)methyl]amino]b-enzoyl], calcium salt (1:1).
“Oxaliplatin” (Eloxatin) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. It is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin in a combination known as FOLFOX for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Compared to cisplatin, the two amine groups are replaced by cyclohexyldiamine for improved antitumour activity. The chlorine ligands are replaced by the oxalato bidentate derived from oxalic acid in order to improve water solubility. Equivalents to Oxaliplatin are known in the art and include, but are not limited to cisplatin, carboplatin, aroplatin, lobaplatin, nedaplatin, and JM-216 (see McKeage et al. (1997) J. Clin. Oncol. 201:1232-1237 and in general, Chemotherapy for Gynecological Neoplasm, Curr. Therapy and Novel Approaches, in the Series Basic and Clinical Oncology, Angioli et al. Eds., 2004).
“FOLFOX” is an abbreviation for a type of combination therapy that is used to treat cancer. This therapy includes 5-FU, oxaliplatin and leucovorin. “FOLFIRI” is an abbreviation for a type of combination therapy that is used treat cancer and comprises, or alternatively consists essentially of, or yet further consists of 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan. Information regarding these treatments are available on the National Cancer Institute's web site, cancer.gov, last accessed on Jan. 16, 2008.
Irinotecan (CPT-11) is sold under the trade name of Camptosar. It is a semi-synthetic analogue of the alkaloid camptothecin, which is activated by hydrolysis to SN-38 and targets topoisomerase I. Chemical equivalents are those that inhibit the interaction of topoisomerase I and DNA to form a catalytically active topoisomerase I-DNA complex. Chemical equivalents inhibit cell cycle progression at G2-M phase resulting in the disruption of cell proliferation.
The term “adjuvant” therapy refers to administration of a therapy or chemotherapeutic regimen to a patient after removal of a tumor by surgery. Adjuvant therapy is typically given to minimize or prevent a possible cancer reoccurrence. Alternatively, “neoadjuvant” therapy refers to administration of therapy or chemotherapeutic regimen before surgery, typically in an attempt to shrink the tumor prior to a surgical procedure to minimize the extent of tissue removed during the procedure.
The phrase “first line” or “second line” or “third line” etc., refers to the order of treatment received by a patient. First line therapy regimens are treatments given first, whereas second or third line therapy are given after the first line therapy or after the second line therapy, respectively. The National Cancer Institute defines first line therapy as “the first treatment for a disease or condition. In patients with cancer, primary treatment can be surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these therapies. First line therapy is also referred to those skilled in the art as primary therapy and primary treatment.” See National Cancer Institute website as www.cancer.gov, last visited on May 1, 2008. Typically, a patient is given a subsequent chemotherapy regimen because the patient did not shown a positive clinical or sub-clinical response to the first line therapy or the first line therapy has stopped.
As used herein, the term “antifolate” intends a drug or biologic that impairs the function of folic acids, e.g., an antimetabolite agent that inhibits the use of a metabolite, i.e. another chemical that is part of normal metabolism. In cancer treatment, antimetabolites interfere with DNA production, thus cell division and growth of the tumor. Non-limiting examples of these agents are dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, such as methotrexate, Aminopterin, and Pemetrexed; thymidylate synthase inhibitors, such as Raltitrexed or Pemetrexed; purine based, i.e. an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, such as Pentostatin, a thiopurine, such as Thioguanine and Mercaptopurine, a halogenated/ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, such as Cladribine, Clofarabine, Fludarabine, or a guanine/guanosine: thiopurine, such as Thioguanine; or Pyrimidine based, i.e. cytosine/cytidine: hypomethylating agent, such as Azacitidine and Decitabine, a DNA polymerase inhibitor, such as Cytarabine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, such as Gemcitabine, or a thymine/thymidine: thymidylate synthase inhibitor, such as a Fluorouracil (5-FU).
In one aspect, the term “chemical equivalent” means the ability of the chemical to selectively interact with its target protein, DNA, RNA or fragment thereof as measured by the inactivation of the target protein, incorporation of the chemical into the DNA or RNA or other suitable methods. Chemical equivalents include, but are not limited to, those agents with the same or similar biological activity and include, without limitation a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or mixtures thereof that interact with and/or inactivate the same target protein, DNA, or RNA as the reference chemical.
The terms “oligonucleotide” or “polynucleotide” or “portion,” or “segment” thereof refer to a stretch of polynucleotide residues which is long enough to use in PCR or various hybridization procedures to identify or amplify identical or related parts of mRNA or DNA molecules. The polynucleotide compositions of this invention include RNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, synthetic forms, and mixed polymers, both sense and antisense strands, and may be chemically or biochemically modified or may contain non-natural or derivatized nucleotide bases, as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. Such modifications include, for example, labels, methylation, substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.), charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), pendent moieties (e.g., polypeptides), intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), chelators, alkylators, and modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.). Also included are synthetic molecules that mimic polynucleotides in their ability to bind to a designated sequence via hydrogen bonding and other chemical interactions. Such molecules are known in the art and include, for example, those in which peptide linkages substitute for phosphate linkages in the backbone of the molecule.
When a genetic marker, e.g., over expression of dUTPase, is used as a basis for selecting a patient for a treatment described herein, the genetic marker is measured before and/or during treatment, and the values obtained are used by a clinician in assessing any of the following: (a) probable or likely suitability of an individual to initially receive treatment(s); (b) probable or likely unsuitability of an individual to initially receive treatment(s); (c) responsiveness to treatment; (d) probable or likely suitability of an individual to continue to receive treatment(s); (e) probable or likely unsuitability of an individual to continue to receive treatment(s); (f) adjusting dosage; (g) predicting likelihood of clinical benefits; or (h) toxicity. As would be well understood by one in the art, measurement of the genetic marker in a clinical setting is a clear indication that this parameter was used as a basis for initiating, continuing, adjusting and/or ceasing administration of the treatments described herein.
“Cancer” is a known medically as a malignant neoplasm, is a broad group of diseases involving unregulated cell growth. In cancer, cells divide and grow uncontrollably, forming malignant tumors, and invade nearby parts of the body. Non-limiting examples include colon cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, esophogeal cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, gall bladder cancer, or pancreatic cancer or leukemia.

In general, uracil, uracil isostere, or a halo uracil is treated with a suitable base such as butyl lithium in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide. The A(−) anion can also be generated by halogen exchange of an A-halo bond with an alkyl lithium. It is then coupled with compound B, wherein LG is a leaving group such as halogen, tosylate or mesylate to provide compounds of formula (I). In some embodiments, protection of an NH, OH, or such other group in uracil, uracil isostere, halo uracil, or the —W—X—Y—Z moiety is required. Compounds of formula (III) can also be synthesized in an analogous manner.
For example, compounds of formula II can be synthesized as schematically illustrated below:

Methods and Therapies
The compositions and compounds as disclosed herein are useful in methods of inhibiting dUTPase or enhancing the efficacy of a dUTPase-directed therapy, or yet further, reversing resistance to dUTPase therapies. The methods comprise, or alternatively consist essentially of, or yet further consist of, contacting the dUTPase with an effective amount of the compound or composition as disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the methods further comprise, or alternatively consist essentially of, or yet further consist of, contacting the dUTPase with an effective amount of a dUTPase-directed therapy. In one aspect, the contacting of the dUTPase-directed therapy is prior to, concurrent or subsequent to contacting with the compound or composition of this disclosure.
One of skill in the art can also determine if the compound or combination inhibits dUTPase in vitro by contacting the compound or combination with purified or recombinant dUTPase in a cell free system. The purified or recombinant dUTPase and can be from any species, e.g., simian, canine, bovine, ovine, rat, mouse or human. In one aspect, the dUTPase is DUT-N or DUT-M. Isolation, characterization and expression of dUTPase isoforms are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,246 and known in the art.
The contacting can be performed cell-free in vitro or ex vivo with a cell or in a cell culture. When performed in vitro or ex vivo, the compounds, compositions or agents can be directly added to the enzyme solution or added to the cell culture medium. When practiced in vitro or ex vivo, the method can be used to screen for novel combination therapies, formulations or treatment regimens, prior to administration to administration to an animal or a human patient. Methods to quantify inhibition are known in the art, see, U.S. Patent Publ. Nos. 2010/0075924 and 2011/0212467 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,601,702. For example, a fixed dose of a dUTPase directed therapy (e.g., 5-FU or Pemetrexed) can be added to the system and varying amounts of the compound can be subsequently added to system. Alternatively, a fixed dose of a compound of this invention can be added to the system and varying amounts of the dUTPase directed therapy (e.g., 5-FU or Pemetrexed) compound can be subsequently added to system.
In one aspect, the contacting is ex vivo and the cell or tissue to be contacted over expresses dUTPase. These cells can be isolated from a patient prior to administration to the patient or can be purchased from a depository such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Non-limiting examples of animal (e.g., canine, an equine, a bovine, a feline, an ovine, a mouse, a rat or a simian) and human cells that are known to over express dUTPase include, without limitation cancer cells, e.g. colon cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer or lung cancer. The cancer can be metastatic or non-metastatic. Methods to quantify inhibition are known in the art, see, U.S. Patent Publ. Nos. 2010/0075924 and 2011/0212467 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,601,702 and Wilson et al. (2012) Mol. Cancer Ther. 11:616-628.
When practiced in vivo in a patient such as an animal or human, the compounds, compositions or agents are administered in an effective amount by a suitable route of administration, as determined by a treating physician taking into account the patient, disease and other factors. When practiced in a non-human animal, e.g., an appropriate mouse model, the method can be used to screen for novel combination therapies, formulations or treatment regimens, prior to administration to a human patient.
This disclosure also provides methods of treating a disease whose treatment is impeded by the expression of dUTPase, comprising, or alternatively consisting essentially of, or yet further consisting of, administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of the compound or composition of this disclosure, thereby treating the disease. In one aspect, the method further comprises isolating a cell or tissue sample from the patient and screening for the expression level of dUTPase, wherein over expression of dUTPase in the sample as compared to a control sample serves as a basis for selecting the patient as suitable for the method and therapies. Methods to quantify dUTPase are known in the art. Effective amounts will vary with the patient, the disease and the general health of the patient and are determined by the treating physician. Methods to quantify inhibition are known in the art, see, U.S. Patent Publ. Nos. 2010/0075924 and 2011/0212467 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,601,702 and Wilson et al. (2012) Mol. Cancer Ther. 11:616-628. If the patient sample shows over expression of dUTPase, the therapy is administered to the patient. If the patient sample does not show over expression, an alternate therapy is chosen. The screen can be repeated throughout therapy as a means to monitor the therapy and/or dosage regimen.
To practice this method, the sample is a patient sample containing the tumor tissue, normal tissue adjacent to said tumor, normal tissue distal to said tumor or peripheral blood lymphocytes. In a further aspect, the patient or patient population to be treated also is treatment naïve.
In one aspect, the method also requires isolating a sample containing the genetic material to be tested; however, it is conceivable that one of skill in the art will be able to analyze and identify genetic markers in situ at some point in the future. Accordingly, in one aspect, the inventions of this application are not to be limited to requiring isolation of the genetic material prior to analysis.
These methods also are not limited by the technique that is used to identify the expression level or in aspects where expression has been linked to a polymorphism, the polymorphism of interest. Suitable methods include but are not limited to the use of hybridization probes, antibodies, primers for PCR analysis, and gene chips, slides and software for high throughput analysis. Additional genetic markers can be assayed and used as negative controls.
In one aspect, the subject or patient is an animal or a human patient. Non-limiting examples of animals include a feline, a canine, a bovine, an equine, an ovine, a mouse, a rat or a simian.
Diseases in which treatment is impeded by the expression of dUTPase include, without limitation, cancer, viral infection, bacterial infection or an autoimmune disorder. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune disorders, a dUTPase inhibitor can be used in combination with an antifolate or fluoropyrimidine or other thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors; parasitic, viral or bacterial infections can be treated similarly employing a combination therapy including a dUTPase inhibitor. Non-limiting examples of cancer include, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer, lung cancer or a leukemia. The cancer can be metastatic or non-metastatic.
In one aspect, the compound or composition is administered as one or more of: a first line therapy or alternatively, a second line therapy, a third line therapy, or a fourth or subsequent line therapy to administration of a dUPTase-directed therapy. Non-limiting examples of dUTPase-directed therapies include an antimetabolite or a fluoropyrmidine therapy or a 5-FU based adjuvant therapy or an equivalent or each thereof, such as 5-FU, tegafur, gimeracil, oteracil potassium, capcitabine, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, methotrexate, or pemetrexed or an equivalent of each thereof.
Certain compounds provided herein demonstrated substantial, such as, 20-100% DUTPase inhibitory effect, e.g., an ability to inhibit dUTPase under conditions described herein below, and/or known to the skilled artisan, compared, for example, a compound provided herein: In one embodiment, certain therapeutic methods provided herein exclude the use of the compounds PCI 10898, 10897, 10928, and 10929.

In a further aspect, the kit contains reagents and instructions to perform the screen to identify patients more likely to respond to the therapy as described above.
Screening Assays
This invention also provides screening assays to identify potential therapeutic agents of known and new compounds and combinations. For example, one of skill in the art can also determine if the compound or combination inhibits dUTPase in vitro by contacting the compound or combination with purified or recombinant dUTPase in a cell free system. The purified or recombinant dUTPase and can be from any species, e.g., simian, canine, bovine, ovine, rat, mouse or human. In one aspect, the dUTPase is DUT-N or DUT-M. Isolation, characterization and expression of dUTPase isoforms are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,246 and known in the art.
The contacting can be performed cell-free in vitro or ex vivo with a cell or in a cell culture. When performed in vitro or ex vivo, the compounds, compositions or agents can be directly added to the enzyme solution or added to the cell culture medium. When practiced in vitro or ex vivo, the method can be used to screen for novel combination therapies, formulations or treatment regimens, prior to administration to administration to an animal or a human patient. Methods to quantify inhibition are known in the art, see, U.S. Patent Publ. Nos. 2010/0075924 and 2011/0212467 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,601,702. For example, a fixed dose of a dUTPase directed therapy (e.g., 5-FU or Pemetrexed) can be added to the system and varying amounts of the compound can be subsequently added to system. Alternatively, a fixed dose of a compound of this invention can be added to the system and varying amounts of the dUTPase directed therapy (e.g., 5-FU or Pemetrexed) compound can be subsequently added to system.
In another aspect, the assay requires contacting a first sample comprising suitable cells or tissue (“control sample”) with an effective amount of a composition of this invention and optionally a dUTPase inhibitor, and contacting a second sample of the suitable cells or tissue (“test sample”) with the agent to be assayed and optionally a dUTPase inhibitor. In one aspect, the cell or tissue over express dUTPase. The inhibition of growth of the first and second cell samples are determined. If the inhibition of growth of the second sample is substantially the same or greater than the first sample, then the agent is a potential drug for therapy. In one aspect, substantially the same or greater inhibition of growth of the cells is a difference of less than about 1%, or alternatively less than about 5% or alternatively less than about 10%, or alternatively greater than about 10%, or alternatively greater than about 20%, or alternatively greater than about 50%, or alternatively greater than about 90%. The contacting can be in vitro or in vivo. Means for determining the inhibition of growth of the cells are well known in the art.
In a further aspect, the test agent is contacted with a third sample of cells or tissue comprising normal counterpart cells or tissue to the control (or alternatively cells that do not over express dUTPase) and test samples and selecting agents that treat the second sample of cells or tissue but does not adversely effect the third sample. For the purpose of the assays described herein, a suitable cell or tissue is described herein such as cancer or other diseases as described herein. Examples of such include, but are not limited to cancer cell or tissue obtained by biopsy, blood, breast cells, colon cells.
Efficacy of the test composition is determined using methods known in the art which include, but are not limited to cell viability assays or apoptosis evaluation.
In yet a further aspect, the assay requires at least two cell types, the first being a suitable control cell.
The assays also are useful to predict whether a subject will be suitably treated by this invention by delivering a composition to a sample containing the cell to be treated and assaying for treatment which will vary with the pathology or for screening for new drugs and combinations. In one aspect, the cell or tissue is obtained from the subject or patient by biopsy. Applicants provide kits for determining whether a pathological cell or a patient will be suitably treated by this therapy by providing at least one composition of this invention and instructions for use.
The test cells can be grown in small multi-well plates and is used to detect the biological activity of test compounds. For the purposes of this invention, the successful candidate drug will block the growth or kill the pathogen but leave the control cell type unharmed.

Biological Methods
A. Drugs, Reagents and Cell Lines
PCI 10213, 10214 and 10216 are suspended in DMSO at a concentration of 100 mmol/L, fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) that can be obtained from Sigma (St Louis, Mo.) and maintained in sterile double-distilled water at stock concentrations of 50 mmol/L. PCI 10216 has the structure:
Recombinant human deoxyuridine nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) is expressed and purified as described in Ladner R D, Carr S A, Huddleston M J, McNulty D E, Caradonna S J. J Biol Chem. 1996 Mar. 29; 271(13):7752-7. All drugs stocks were aliquoted and diluted as appropriate prior to use. The oligonucelotide primer, templates and fluorophore- and quencher-labeled detection probes are synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa), subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis purification and reconstituted in Omnipur sterile nuclease-free water (EMD Chemicals USA, Gibbstown N.J.) at a stock concentration of 100 μmol/L. The two non-emissive (dark) quenching molecules incorporated into the detection probes include the Iowa black fluorescein quencher (IBFQ; absorption max 531 nm) and ZEN (non-abbreviation; absorption max 532 nm). The fluorescent label utilized was 6-FAM (5′-carboxyfluorescein; excitation max.=494 nm, emission max.=520 nm). Probes were further diluted to a working stock of 10 μmol/L and aliquoted to avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles. AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase, GeneAmp 10×PCR Buffer 2, MgCl2 and MicroAmp Optical 96-well Reaction Plates were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, Calif.). dNTPs were purchased individually at stock concentrations of 100 mmol/L from New England Biolabs at HPLC-certified >99% purity (Ipswich, Mass.).
B. Assay Components, Instrumentation and Real-Time Fluorescence Conditions
Reaction mixtures contained primer, probe and template at an equimolar final concentration of 0.4 μmol/L. Magnesium chloride (MgCl2) was included at a final concentration of 2 mmol/L. Non-limiting dNTPs were included in the reaction mix in excess at a final concentration of 100 μmol/L (dUTP/dTTP was excluded). AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase was added at 0.875 U/reaction, 2.5 μl of 10×PCR buffer 2 added and nuclease-free ddH2O added to a final reaction volume of 25 μl. For dUTP inhibition analysis, the volume of ddH2O was further modified to accommodate an additional 1 μl of dUTPase (10 ng/μl) and 1 μl of inhibitor or DMSO control. Thermal profiling and fluorescence detection was performed using the ‘isothermal’ program on board an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System. For analysis of dNTPs, the thermal profile consisted of an 8 min 37° C. step followed by a 10 min 95° C. step to ‘hot-start’ the Taq polymerase and a primer extension time of up to 30 min at 60° C. depending on the application. Raw fluorescence spectra for 6-FAM was measured using filter A at specified time intervals to follow assay progression using Sequence Detection Software (SDS Version 1.4, Applied Biosystems) and exported and analyzed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond Wash.) and Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla Calif.). In all cases, fluorescence values for blank reactions (limiting dNTP omitted) were subtracted to give normalized fluorescence units (NFU) to account for background fluorescence.
C. MTS Growth Inhibition Assay
The Cell Titer96 AQueous MTS assay (Promega) was carried out according to the manufacturers guidelines. IC50(72h) values were calculated from sigmoidal-dose response curves utilizing Prism (Graphpad, San Diego, Calif.). The combination effect was determined by the combination index (CI) method utilizing Calcusyn software (Biosoft, Ferguson, Mo.). Fraction affected (FA) was calculated from the percent growth inhibition: FA=(100−% growth inhibition)/100. CI values <1, synergism; 1-1.2, additive and >1.2, antagonism.
D. Colony Formation Assay
Colony forming assay showing the ability of colon (SW620, HCT116), non-small cell lung (A549, H460, H1299 and H358) and breast (MCF7) cancer cells to survive and proliferate following transient 24 hour exposure to single agent PCI 1013, FUdR and combinations. Specifically, cells were seeded at densities between 50 and 100 cells/well in 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of PCI 10213, a fixed dose of FUdR and combinations of these. After 24 hours, drug was removed, cells were rinsed and allowed to outgrow for 10-14 days. At the conclusion of the outgrowth, cells were fixed in 60% ice cold methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet, scanned and counted. Data is presented as percentage of untreated controls (mean±SD). Fraction affected and combination indexes were calculated according to the method of Chou and Talalay where <1 is indicative of a synergistic drug interaction.
E. In Vivo Analysis
Xenograft experiments were conducted in male NU/NU nude mice (Charles River, Wilmington, Mass.) that were 6-8 weeks old. Subcutaneous A549 xenografts were established and allowed to grow until they reached ˜50 mm3 (day 1). Animals were randomized to treatment groups: vehicle, pemetrexed 50 mg/kg, PCI 10213 and combination of pemetrexed plus PCI 10213 (n=5, group). Pemetrexed was administered at 50 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection every two days. PCI 10213 was administered at 75 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection every two days. The combination of pemetrexed and PCI 10214 was administered by intraperitoneal injection every two days. Two perpendicular diameters of tumors were measured every 2 days with a digital caliper by the same investigator. Tumor volume was calculated according to the following formula: TV (mm3)=(length[mm]×(width[mm]2)/2. Mice were inspected everyday for overall health and bodyweight was measured every 2 days as an index of toxicity. All animal protocols were approved by the USC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
EXAMPLE 19
Identification of the dUTPase Inhibitor PCI 10213
PCI 10213 and reference compound 10216 were screened in a fluorescence-based assay. The assay employs a DNA polymerase-based approach utilizing an oligonucleotide template with 3 distinct regions: a 3′ primer binding region, a mid-template dUTP/thymidine triphosphate (TTP) detection region and a 5′ 6-Flavin adenine mononucleotide (FAM)-labeled probe binding region that incorporates a black hole quenching moiety. During the reaction, the probe and primer hybridize to the oligonucleotide template to form the template:primer:probe complex. When Taq polymerase binds to the primer in the TPP complex and dUTP is present, successful extension of the nascent strand occurs and the inherent 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase cleaves and displaces the 6-FAM-labeled probe in a 5′ to 3′ direction, releasing the 6-FAM fluorophore from its proximity to the three quenchers. This displacement effectively disrupts the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and the resulting fluorescence detected upon excitation is directly proportional to the amount of the dUTP available in the assay for incorporation ( FIG. 3 ). Conversely, when the dUTP is unavailable, exhausted, or degraded by dUTPase and is no longer available for incorporation, Taq polymerase stalls and extension delay and/or chain termination of the nascent strand occurs. In this instance, probe hydrolysis/degradation does not occur and the probe remains dark as fluorescence remains quenched via FRET. Since fluorescence is directly proportional to the concentration of dUTP, the assay was easily modified to measure dUTP and the effects of inhibitors on dUTP hydrolysis by the enzyme dUTPase. The template BHQ-DT6 (Black Hole Quencher-Detection Template 6) for detecting up to 60 pmols of dUTP was included for this application of the assay along with 50 pmols of dUTP and 5 ng of recombinant dUTPase. The reaction was incubated at 37° C. for 8 mins and terminated by a 10 min incubation at 95° C. to simultaneously inactivate dUTPase and activate the hot-start Taq polymerase. The fluorescence generated during the detection step is directly proportional to the concentration of dUTP remaining after the 8 min incubation. The concentration of dUTP at reaction termination and therefore inhibition of dUTPase in the presence and absence of inhibitors and appropriate dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) controls can be determined. In preliminary dUTPase inhibition experiments PCI 10213 was compared directly to PCI 10216 at a range of concentrations between 0 and 83 μmol/L (Table 1, FIG. 3A ). Inhibition of dUTPase enzymatic activity at the maximum dose of 83 μmol/L was significant for both compounds at 95 and 86% for PCI 10216 and 10213 respectively. The level of inhibition at 1.3 μmol/L was 60% and 28% respectively. The IC50 calculated in Prism for PCI 10216 was 0.8 μmol/L and for PCI 10213 7.2 μmol/L.  TABLE 1

PCI 10213 Shows Little to No Single Agent Activity in Contrast to PCI 10216
PCI 10213, 10214 and 10216 were evaluated for their antitumor activity in colorectal cancer cells using the MTS growth inhibition assay.
HCT116 and SW620 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of each agent for 72 hours and growth inhibition was directly compared to vehicle-treated controls. In HCT116 cells, PCI 10213 and PCI 10214 demonstrated little to no single agent activity even up to the elevated concentration of 75 μmol/L with a modest decrease in growth of 28% observed with 100 μmol/L PCI 10213. In contrast, PCI 10216 demonstrated dose-dependent decreases in cell proliferation detectable at concentrations as low as 6.25 μmol/L and culminating with a 67% reduction in proliferation with 100 μmol/L.
In SW620 cells, neither PCI 10213 or 10214 had any single agent activity up to 75 μmol/L and only modest activity of ˜30% at 100 μmol/L. PCI 10216 demonstrated dose-dependent decreases in proliferation up to 70% at 100 μmol/L ( FIG. 3B ).
The NSCLC cell lines A549 and H1299 were exposed to increasing concentrations of each agent for 72 hours and growth inhibition was directly compared to vehicle-treated controls. In A549 cells, PCI 10213 and PCI 10214 demonstrated modest single agent activity with the elevated concentration of 75 and 100 μmol/L showing modest decreases in growth of ˜25% at 100 μmol/L PCI 10213 and 10214. PCI 10216 demonstrated similar decreases in cell proliferation as 10213 and 10214 at lower doses, but significantly more at the elevated doses with 30% and 55% reductions in proliferation with 75 and 100 μmol/L respectively. In H1299 cells, PCI 10213, 10214 and 10216 had modest single agent activity up to 12.5 μmol/L with increased activity of up to ˜40% at 100 μmol/L. Of note, PCI 10213 demonstrated greater growth inhibition at 100 μmol/L than PCI 10216 with decreases in cell proliferation of 40% and 30% respectively at 100 μmol/L.
EXAMPLE 21
PCI 10213 Demonstrates Synergy with 5-FU Through Increase Growth Inhibition
MTS growth inhibition assays were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of both PCI 10213 and reference compound PCI 10216 alone and in combination with the fluoropyrimidine thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at inhibiting the growth of colorectal (HCT116 and SW620) cell line models. Increasing concentrations of 5-FU between 0 and 100 μmol/L demonstrated dose-dependent increases in growth inhibition in both the colorectal cancer cell lines evaluated. Simultaneous treatment with increasing concentrations of 5-FU and either PCI 10213 and 10216 at fixed concentrations of 25 μmol/L resulted in additive and synergistic increases in growth inhibition over the majority of concentrations tested up to 25 μmol/L 5-FU in both CRC cell lines examined. Of note, PCI 10216 as a single agent used at 25 μmol/L induced 30% growth inhibition in SW620 cells and 44% in HCT116 cells whereas PCI 10213 had no detectable effect on growth inhibition at 25 μmol/L in either cell line despite showing additive and synergistic interactions with 5-FU. These data demonstrate a clear enhancement of 5-FU growth inhibitory activity through the addition of PCI 10213 with significantly less single agent activity than PCI 10216. See, FIG. 4 .
EXAMPLE 22
PCI 10213 Demonstrates Synergy with FUdR in Reducing Cancer Cell Viability
Colony forming assays were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of both PCI 10213, PCI 10214 and reference compound PCI 10216 alone and in combination with the fluoropyrimidine thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) at reducing cancer cell viability in colorectal (HCT116), breast (MCF-7) and non-small cell lung (H1299, A549, H358 and H460) cell line models. Increasing concentrations of FUdR between 0.5 and 2.5 μmol/L demonstrated dose-dependent decreases in colonies formed in all cell lines evaluated. Increasing concentrations of PCI 10213 between 3.1 and 25 μmol/L had no significant effects on the number of colonies formed whereas the elevated concentration of PCI 10216 at 25 and 50 μmol/L demonstrated some reduction in the number of colonies formed in A549, H460 and HCT116 cells. Reference compound PCI 10216 demonstrated strong synergy when combined with fixed doses of FUdR in all cell lines examined. Subsequently, increasing concentrations of PCI 10213 were combined with a fixed dose of FUdR to evaluate the combined drug effect. In NSCLC cells, concentrations of PCI 10213 ranging from 3.1 μmol/L to 25 μmol/L were combined with 1 μmol/L FUdR. One μmol/L FUdR had no significant effect on number of colonies formed compared to vehicle-treated controls. However, all combinations of PCI 10213 and 1 μmol/L FUdR demonstrated highly significant reductions in colonies formed when compared to the corresponding single agent concentrations of PCI 10213 alone or 1 μmol/L FUdR. The effectiveness of this combination was pronounced in A549 and H460 cells where 12.5 and 25 μmol/L PCI 10213 combined with 1 μmol/L FUdR reduced cell viability by >95% compared to vehicle-treated controls.
In colorectal cancer cells, concentrations of PCI 10213 ranging from 3.1 μmol/L to 50 μmol/L were combined with 0.5 μmol/L FUdR in HCT116 cells and 1 μmol/L FUdR in SW620 cells.
Similar to the NSCLC cells, neither PCI 10213 or the fixed dose of FUdR single agent had any significant effect on the number of colonies formed but demonstrated a strong synergistic reduction in colonies in all combinations tested in HCT116 and SW620 cells. Specifically, the combination of 12.5 and 25 μmol/L PCI 10213 combined with 0.5 μmol/L FUdR reduced colony formation by >95% in HCT116 cells and >50% in the strongly FUdR-resistant SW620 cell line. Importantly, despite neither agent alone exerting any effect on the number of colonies formed, complete loss of viability was achieved with the 50 μmol/L PCI 10213 and FUdR combination in HCT116 cells. In the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, treatment with 0.5 μmol/L FUdR had no significant impact on the number of colonies formed, but when combined with concentrations of PCI 10213 ranging from 3.1 μmol/L to 25 μmol/L significant reductions in colony formation of between 30 and 60% was observed. See, FIGS. 5-7 .

Diastereomer PCI 10586 is the Primary Active Component of PCI 10213
A. Drugs and Reagents
PCI 10586, 10585 and 10213 were suspended in DMSO at a concentration of 100 mmol/L, fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) was obtained from Sigma (St Louis, Mo.) and maintained in sterile double-distilled water at stock concentrations of 50 mmol/L. Recombinant human deoxyuridine nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) was expressed and purified as described previously [Please provide reference or confirm as noted above]. All drugs stocks were aliquoted and diluted as appropriate prior to use. The oligonucelotide primer, templates and fluorophore- and quencher-labeled detection probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa), subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis purification and reconstituted in Omnipur sterile nuclease-free water (EMD Chemicals USA, Gibbstown N.J.) at a stock concentration of 100 μmol/L. The two non-emissive (dark) quenching molecules incorporated into the detection probes include the Iowa black fluorescein quencher (IBFQ; absorption max 531 nm) and ZEN (non-abbreviation; absorption max 532 nm). The fluorescent label utilized was 6-FAM (5′-carboxyfluorescein; excitation max.=494 nm, emission max.=520 nm). Probes were further diluted to a working stock of 10 μmol/L and aliquoted to avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles. AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase, GeneAmp 10×PCR Buffer 2, MgCl2 and MicroAmp Optical 96-well Reaction Plates were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, Calif.). dNTPs were purchased individually at stock concentrations of 100 mmol/L from New England Biolabs at HPLC-certified >99% purity (Ipswich, Mass.).
B Assay Components, Instrumentation and Real-Time Fluorescence Conditions
Reaction mixtures contained primer, probe and template at an equimolar final concentration of 0.4 μmol/L. MgCl2 was included at a final concentration of 3 mmol/L. Non-limiting dNTPs were included in the reaction mix in excess at a final concentration of 100 μmol/L (dUTP/dTTP was excluded). AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase was added at 0.875 U/reaction, 2.5 μl of 10×PCR buffer 2 added and nuclease-free ddH2O added to a final reaction volume of 30 μl. For dUTP inhibition analysis, the volume of ddH2O was further modified to accommodate an additional 1 μl of dUTPase (2.5 ng/μl) and 1 μl of inhibitor or DMSO control. Thermal profiling and fluorescence detection was performed using the ‘isothermal’ program on board an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System. For analysis of dNTPs, the thermal profile consisted of an 10 min 37° C. step followed by a 10 min 95° C. step to ‘hot-start’ the Taq polymerase and a 5-cycle primer extension time of 10 min at 60° C. Raw fluorescence spectra for 6-FAM was measured using filter A at specified time intervals to follow assay progression using Sequence Detection Software (SDS Version 1.4, Applied Biosystems) and exported and analyzed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond Wash.) and Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla Calif.). In all cases, fluorescence values for blank reactions (limiting dNTP omitted) were subtracted to give normalized fluorescence units (NFU) to account for background fluorescence.
C. dUTPase Inhibition Screening Reveals that Diastereomer PCI 10586 is the Primary Active Component of PCI 10213
PCI 10213 possesses two molecular diastereomers: PCI 10586 and 10585. The diastereomer compounds were isolated by preparative chiral HPLC and screened in a novel fluorescence-based assay as described in Wilson et al. (2011) Nucleic Acids Res., September 1 39(17). The assay employs a DNA polymerase-based approach utilizing an oligonucleotide template with 3 distinct regions: a 3′ primer binding region, a mid-template dUTP/TTP detection region and a 5′ 6-FAM-labeled probe binding region that incorporates a black hole quenching moiety as previously described. Since fluorescence is directly proportional to the concentration of dUTP, the assay was easily modified to measure dUTP and the effects of inhibitors on dUTP hydrolysis by the enzyme dUTPase. The template BHQ-DT6 for detecting up to 60 pmols of dUTP was included for this application of the assay along with 50 pmols of dUTP and 2.5 ng of recombinant dUTPase. The reaction was incubated at 37° C. for 10 mins and terminated by a 10 min incubation at 95° C. to simultaneously inactivate dUTPase and activate the hot-start Taq polymerase. The subsequent fluorescence detection step involved five 10 min cycles at 60° C. to completion. The fluorescence generated during the detection step is directly proportional to the concentration of dUTP remaining after the 10 min incubation. The concentration of dUTP at reaction termination is directly proportional to the extent of inhibition of dUTPase in the presence and absence of inhibitors and appropriate DMSO controls.  TABLE 2

dUTPase inhibition comparisons were made between compounds PCI 10213, 10585, and 10586 at a range of concentrations between 1.3 and 83.3 μmol/L (Table 2). Inhibition of dUTPase enzymatic activity at the maximum dose of 83.3 μmol/L was significant for compound 10586 with 75.6% inhibition, moderate for compound 10213 with 54.6% inhibition and modest for compound 10585 with 9.5%. At moderate concentration of 5.2 μmol/L, compound 10586 demonstrated strong inhibition of 38%, compound 10213 had 14.5% and 10585 had 3.4% inhibition. The level of inhibition at 1.3 μmol/L was 16.4%, 4.7%, and 0.6% for 10585, 10213 and 10585 respectively. The strong dUTPase inhibition observed for 10586, the intermediate inhibition of the heterogeneous 10213 and the distinct lack of dUTPase inhibition by 10585 confirms that diasteromer PCI 10586 (28.46 min retention time) is the primary active molecule in compound PCI 10213.

Colony forming assays were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of both PCI 10213, PCI 10585 and PCI 10586 alone and in combination with the fluoropyrimidine thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) at reducing cancer cell viability in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Increasing concentrations of FUdR between 0.5 and 5 μmol/L demonstrated dose-dependent decreases in colonies formed ( FIG. 11A ). Increasing concentrations of PCI 10213, 10585 or 10586 between 0.78 and 12.5 μmol/L had no significant effects on the number of colonies formed ( FIG. 11B ).
To evaluate the combined drug effect, increasing concentrations of PCI 10213, 01585 and 10586 were combined with a fixed dose of 0.5 μmol/L FUdR. Of note, 0.5 μmol/L FUdR had no significant effect on number of colonies formed compared to vehicle-treated controls ( FIG. 11A ). PCI 10213, demonstrated significant reductions in colonies formed when combined with FUdR at concentrations of 6.25 μmol/L and greater. However, all concentrations of PCI 10286 combined with 0.5 μmol/L FUdR demonstrated reductions in colonies formed even at the lowest dose of 0.78 μmol/L when compared to the corresponding single agent concentrations of PCI 10586 and 0.5 μmol/L FUdR. Importantly, PCI 10585 demonstrated no reductions in colony formation when combined with FUdR at any concentration up to 6.25 μmol/L with modest reductions at 12.5 μmol/L ( FIG. 11C ). These data support the in vitro dUTPase inhibitor screen demonstrating that PCI 10586 has significantly more cell-based activity than PCI 10213 and that PCI 10585 is significantly less potent than either 10213 or 10586.
Reference compound PCI 10950: demonstrated strong synergy when combined with fixed doses of FUdR in all cell lines examined. Subsequently, increasing concentrations of PCI 102951 and PCI 10952 were combined with a fixed dose of 0.5 μmol/L FUdR to evaluate the combined drug effect. Substantial reductions in colonies formed were observed when PCI 10951 was combined with 0.5 μmol/L FUdR compared to the corresponding single agent concentrations of PCI 102951 alone or 0.5 μmol/L FUdR. PCI 10952 demonstrated modest reductions in colonies formed when combined with 0.5 μmol/L FUdR in HCT116 cells under the conditions tested.
Colony forming assays were subsequently performed to evaluate the effectiveness of additional PCI compounds alone and in combination with FUdR at reducing cancer cell viability in the HCT-8 colorectal cell line model. FUdR at 1 μmol/L demonstrated no substantial effect on colonies formed. Increasing concentrations of all PCI compounds between 1.56 and 6.25 μmol/L also had no significant effects on the number of colonies formed. Reference compound PCI 10950 demonstrated strong synergy when combined with the fixed dose of FUdR. Subsequently, increasing concentrations of PCI compounds were combined with a fixed dose of 1 μmol/L FUdR to evaluate the combined drug effect. Substantial reductions in colonies formed were observed when PCI 10951, PCI 10927, PCI 10928, PCI 10929, PCI 10930, and PCI 10933 was combined with 1 μmol/L FUdR compared to the corresponding single agent concentrations in HCT-8 cells.
