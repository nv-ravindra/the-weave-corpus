DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Autotaxin and LPA
Autotaxin (ATX, NPP2, or ENPP2), an approximately 120 kDa glycoprotein, is a secreted nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP) with lysophospholipase D activity that converts extracellular lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and other lysophospholipids to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). ATX is considered to be responsible for the majority of circulating LPA production.
LPA acts through sets of specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as LPA1, LPA2, LPA3, LPA4, LPA5, LPA6, LPA7, LPA8, in an autocrine and paracrine fashion to produce a variety of biological responses. For example, lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), are known to affect such biological functions as cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, migration, adhesion, invasion, and morphogenesis. In addition, LPA is known to play a role in such processes as platelet activation, smooth muscle contraction, actin stress fiber formation, and cell migration.
ATX and LPA have been detected in various biological fluids such as serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, seminal fluid, urine, and saliva, both in animals and humans, suggesting that they are potential biomarkers to predict certain diseases. For example, serum ATX concentration and activity is elevated in patients with chronic liver diseases and in pregnant women. In addition, ATX concentration has been found to be lower in postoperative cancer patients as a result of postoperative damage or poor nutritional state. In addition, ATX is known to be essential for normal development. For example, ATX-deficient mice die at embryonic day 9.5 with profound vascular defects in both the yolk sac and the embryo. Furthermore, at embryonic day 8.5 ATX-deficient embryos were found to have malformed allantois, neural tube defects, and asymmetric headfolds.
Cancer
ATX has been demonstrated to increase cell motility, neovascularization, proliferation and aggressiveness of tumors. It is upregulated in numerous tumor lineages, such as breast, renal, liver, glioblastoma, ovarian and prostate cancer.
In some embodiments, disclosed herein are methods of treating cancer with a compound disclosed herein.
ATX is a prometastatic enzyme initially isolated from the conditioned medium of human melanoma cells. In addition, ATX overexpression is frequently observed in malignant tumor tissues such as breast cancer, renal cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma. LPA also contributes to tumorigenesis by increasing motility and invasiveness of cells.
The term “cancer” as used herein, refers to an abnormal growth of cells that tend to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to metastasize (spread). Types of cancer include, but are not limited to, solid tumors (such as those of the bladder, bowel, brain, breast, endometrium, heart, kidney, lung, liver, uterus, lymphatic tissue (lymphoma), ovary, pancreas or other endocrine organ (thyroid), prostate, skin (melanoma or basal cell cancer) or hematological tumors (such as the leukemias and lymphomas) at any stage of the disease with or without metastases.
Fibrosis
In some embodiments, disclosed herein are methods of treating fibrosis with a compound disclosed herein.
“Fibrosis,” as used herein, refers to the accumulation of extracellular matrix constituents that occurs following trauma, inflammation, tissue repair, immunological reactions, cellular hyperplasia, and neoplasia.
In some embodiments, disclosed herein is a method of reducing fibrosis in a tissue comprising contacting a fibrotic cell or tissue with a compound disclosed herein, in an amount sufficient to decrease or inhibit the fibrosis. In some embodiments, the fibrosis includes a fibrotic condition.
In some embodiments, reducing fibrosis, or treatment of a fibrotic condition, includes reducing or inhibiting one or more of: formation or deposition of extracellular matrix proteins; the number of pro-fibrotic cell types (e.g., fibroblast or immune cell numbers); cellular collagen or hydroxyproline content within a fibrotic lesion; expression or activity of a fibrogenic protein; or reducing fibrosis associated with an inflammatory response.
In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is primary fibrosis. In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is idiopathic. In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is associated with (e.g., is secondary to) a disease; a toxin; an insult (e.g., an environmental hazard); a medical treatment, or a combination thereof.
In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the lung (pulmonary fibrosis), a fibrotic condition of the liver (renal fibrosis), a fibrotic condition of the heart or vasculature (cardiac fibrosis), a fibrotic condition of the kidney (renal fibrosis), a fibrotic condition of the skin, a fibrotic condition of the gastrointestinal tract, or a combination thereof.
In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the lung. In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition of the lung is chosen from one or more of: pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP), interstitial lung disease, cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA), bronchiolitis obliterans, or bronchiectasis. In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition of the lung treated with the methods of the invention is associated with (e.g., secondary to) a cancer treatment.
In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the liver.
In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the heart.
In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the kidney.
In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the skin.
In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the gastrointestinal tract.

In one aspect, compounds described herein are in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. As well, active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity are included in the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, the compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.
“Pharmaceutically acceptable,” as used herein, refers a material, such as a carrier or diluent, which does not abrogate the biological activity or properties of the compound, and is relatively nontoxic, i.e., the material is administered to an individual without causing undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the components of the composition in which it is contained.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a form of a therapeutically active agent that consists of a cationic form of the therapeutically active agent in combination with a suitable anion, or in alternative embodiments, an anionic form of the therapeutically active agent in combination with a suitable cation. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use. International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, Wiley-VCH 2002. S. M. Berge, L. D. Bighley, D. C. Monkhouse, J. Pharm. Sci. 1977, 66, 1-19. P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth, editors, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, Weinheim/Zürich:Wiley-VCH/VHCA, 2002. Pharmaceutical salts typically are more soluble and more rapidly soluble in stomach and intestinal juices than non-ionic species and so are useful in solid dosage forms. Furthermore, because their solubility often is a function of pH, selective dissolution in one or another part of the digestive tract is possible and this capability can be manipulated as one aspect of delayed and sustained release behaviours. Also, because the salt-forming molecule can be in equilibrium with a neutral form, passage through biological membranes can be adjusted.
In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are obtained by reacting a compound described herein with an acid. In some embodiments, the compound described herein (i.e. free base form) is basic and is reacted with an organic acid or an inorganic acid. Inorganic acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and metaphosphoric acid. Organic acids include, but are not limited to, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid; 2,2-dichloroacetic acid; 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid; 2-oxoglutaric acid; 4-acetamidobenzoic acid; 4-aminosalicylic acid; acetic acid; adipic acid; ascorbic acid (L); aspartic acid (L); benzenesulfonic acid; benzoic acid; camphoric acid (+); camphor-10-sulfonic acid (+); capric acid (decanoic acid); caproic acid (hexanoic acid); caprylic acid (octanoic acid); carbonic acid; cinnamic acid; citric acid; cyclamic acid; dodecylsulfuric acid; ethane-1,2-disulfonic acid; ethanesulfonic acid; formic acid; fumaric acid; galactaric acid; gentisic acid; glucoheptonic acid (D); gluconic acid (D); glucuronic acid (D); glutamic acid; glutaric acid; glycerophosphoric acid; glycolic acid; hippuric acid; isobutyric acid; lactic acid (DL); lactobionic acid; lauric acid; maleic acid; malic acid (−L); malonic acid; mandelic acid (DL); methanesulfonic acid; naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid; naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid; nicotinic acid; oleic acid; oxalic acid; palmitic acid; pamoic acid; phosphoric acid; proprionic acid; pyroglutamic acid (−L); salicylic acid; sebacic acid; stearic acid; succinic acid; sulfuric acid; tartaric acid (+L); thiocyanic acid; toluenesulfonic acid (p); and undecylenic acid.
In some embodiments, a compound described herein is prepared as a chloride salt, sulfate salt, bromide salt, mesylate salt, maleate salt, citrate salt or phosphate salt. In some embodiments, a compound described herein is prepared as a hydrochloride salt.
In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are obtained by reacting a compound described herein with a base. In some embodiments, the compound described herein is acidic and is reacted with a base. In such situations, an acidic proton of the compound described herein is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, or an aluminum ion. In some cases, compounds described herein coordinate with an organic base, such as, but not limited to, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, meglumine, N-methylglucamine, dicyclohexylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine. In other cases, compounds described herein form salts with amino acids such as, but not limited to, arginine, lysine, and the like.

In some embodiments, the compounds provided herein are prepared as a sodium salt.
It should be understood that a reference to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes the solvent addition forms. In some embodiments, solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Solvates of compounds described herein are conveniently prepared or formed during the processes described herein. In addition, the compounds provided herein optionally exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms.
The methods and formulations described herein include the use of N-oxides (if appropriate), crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds described herein, as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity.
In some embodiments, sites on the organic radicals (e.g. alkyl groups, aromatic rings) of compounds described herein are susceptible to various metabolic reactions. Incorporation of appropriate substituents on the organic radicals will reduce, minimize or eliminate this metabolic pathway. In specific embodiments, the appropriate substituent to decrease or eliminate the susceptibility of the aromatic ring to metabolic reactions is, by way of example only, a halogen, deuterium, an alkyl group, a haloalkyl group, or a deuteroalkyl group.
In another embodiment, the compounds described herein are labeled isotopically (e.g. with a radioisotope) or by another other means, including, but not limited to, the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, or chemiluminescent labels.
Compounds described herein include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in the various formulae and structures presented herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the present compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine and chlorine, such as, for example, 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 35S, 18F, 36Cl. In one aspect, isotopically-labeled compounds described herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. In one aspect, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium affords certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, such as, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements.
In some embodiments, the compounds described herein possess one or more stereocenters and each stereocenter exists independently in either the R or S configuration. The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric, enantiomeric, atropisomers, and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. The compounds and methods provided herein include all cis, trans, syn, anti, entgegen (E), and zusammen (Z) isomers as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof.
Individual stereoisomers are obtained, if desired, by methods such as, stereoselective synthesis and/or the separation of stereoisomers by chiral chromatographic columns. In certain embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds/salts, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. In some embodiments, resolution of enantiomers is carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds described herein. In another embodiment, diastereomers are separated by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. In other embodiments, separation of steroisomers is performed by chromatography or by the forming diastereomeric salts and separation by recrystallization, or chromatography, or any combination thereof. Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, “Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions”, John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981. In some embodiments, stereoisomers are obtained by stereoselective synthesis.
In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A “prodrug” refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. They are, for instance, bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. Further or alternatively, the prodrug also has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug is a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to provide the active entity. A further example of a prodrug is a short peptide (polyamino acid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound.
Prodrugs of the compounds described herein include, but are not limited to, esters, ethers, carbonates, thiocarbonates, N-acyl derivatives, N-acyloxyalkyl derivatives, quaternary derivatives of tertiary amines, N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases, amino acid conjugates, phosphate esters, and sulfonate esters. See for example Design of Prodrugs, Bundgaard, A. Ed., Elseview, 1985 and Method in Enzymology, Widder, K. et al., Ed.; Academic, 1985, vol. 42, p. 309-396; Bundgaard, H. “Design and Application of Prodrugs” in A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Krosgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Ed., 1991, Chapter 5, p. 113-191; and Bundgaard, H., Advanced Drug Delivery Review, 1992, 8, 1-38, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, a hydroxyl group in the compounds disclosed herein is used to form a prodrug, wherein the hydroxyl group is incorporated into an acyloxyalkyl ester, alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl ester, alkyl ester, aryl ester, phosphate ester, sugar ester, ether, and the like. In some embodiments, a hydroxyl group in the compounds disclosed herein is a prodrug wherein the hydroxyl is then metabolized in vivo to provide a carboxylic acid group. In some embodiments, a carboxyl group is used to provide an ester or amide (i.e. the prodrug), which is then metabolized in vivo to provide a carboxylic acid group. In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as alkyl ester prodrugs.
Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a compound described herein as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the herein-described compounds is a prodrug for another derivative or active compound.
In additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein are metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect.
A “metabolite” of a compound disclosed herein is a derivative of that compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “active metabolite” refers to a biologically active derivative of a compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “metabolized,” as used herein, refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Thus, enzymes may produce specific structural alterations to a compound. For example, cytochrome P450 catalyzes a variety of oxidative and reductive reactions while uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferases catalyze the transfer of an activated glucuronic-acid molecule to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and free sulphydryl groups. Metabolites of the compounds disclosed herein are optionally identified either by administration of compounds to a host and analysis of tissue samples from the host, or by incubation of compounds with hepatic cells in vitro and analysis of the resulting compounds.
Synthesis of Compounds
Compounds described herein are synthesized using standard synthetic techniques or using methods known in the art in combination with methods described herein. Alternative reaction conditions for the synthetic transformations described herein may be employed such as variation of solvent, reaction temperature, reaction time, as well as different chemical reagents and other reaction conditions. The starting materials are available from commercial sources or are readily prepared.
Tryptophan and substituted tryptophans are commercially available. In some embodiments, substituted tryptophans are synthesized in racemic form. In some embodiments, individual enantiomers of tryptophan and substituted tryptophans are obtained by resolution (c.f. Coker et al, J. Org. Chem., 1962, 27, p 850) of racemic tryptophan and substituted tryptophans. In other embodiments, individual enantiomers of tryptophan and substituted tryptophans are prepared enantioselectively (see Ma et al, J. Med. Chem., 2001, 66, p 4525 and Pavlov et al, J. Org. Chem., 2011, 76, p 6116 and references cited therein). Compounds are prepared using standard organic chemistry techniques such as those described in, for example, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, 6th Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. Alternative reaction conditions for the synthetic transformations described herein may be employed such as variation of solvent, reaction temperature, reaction time, as well as different chemical reagents and other reaction conditions. The starting materials are available from commercial sources.
In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as outlined in Scheme 1.
In some embodiments, the preparation of compounds described herein begins with the appropriately substituted tryptophan 1-I. In some embodiments, the tryptoline analog 1-II is prepared by a Pictet-Spengler reaction of 1-I with formaldehyde (R5═R6═H; Scheme 1). Using aldehydes or ketones, substituted tryptoline derivatives (R5 and R6 are H and/or alkyl) are prepared. In some embodiments, the amino acid of 1-II is coupled with an amine R—NH2 (where R is -L2-B-L3-Q as described herein) in the presence of triphosgene followed by heating in a solvent such as DMSO to yield 1-III. In some embodiments, the indole NH is alkylated by treatment of 1-III with, for example Cs2CO3 and an alkylating agent in a solvent such as DMF. In some further embodiments, the resulting N-alkylated analog (1-IV) is further modified using standard chemical transformations. Racemic compounds synthesized using this route may be resolved into the corresponding enantiomers using standard procedures, for example, using chiral phase HPLC.
An alternative route to preparing compounds described herein is shown in Scheme 2.
In some embodiments, the basic nitrogen of the tricyclic tryptoline 2-I is protected as the N-Boc derivative 2-II using Boc2O under standard conditions. In some embodiments, alkylation of the indole N—H of 2-II to give 2-III is achieved using the procedures described for Scheme 1. Deprotection under acidic conditions (e.g. with TFA) yields 2-IV. This sequence allows for the asymmetric preparation of substituted tryptophan derivatives 2-IV starting from optically active tryptophans in which racemization of the chiral center has been substantially reduced. In some embodiments, compound 2-IV is converted in one step to 2-VI as described for Scheme 1. In some other embodiments, compound 2-IV is converted to 2-VI in 2 steps consisting of amide bond formation with an amine R—NH2 (to give 2-V) followed by cyclization in the presence of triphosgene to afford 2-VI. In some embodiments, 6-membered ring analogs of general structure 2-VIII are synthesized from 2-V by treatment with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a base such as Et3N in a solvent such as THF. In some embodiments, the resulting bromo-containing compound 2-VII undergoes an intramolecular cyclization to give 2-VIII.
Scheme 3 describes tetracyclic analogs containing an oxazolidinone ring such as 3-IV.
In some embodiments, starting with the, chemoselective reduction of the acid group of tryptoline 3-1 using, for example, BH3 in THF results in the alcohol 3-II. Deprotection of the Boc-amine using e.g. TFA provides 3-III which may then be cyclized in the presence of CDI and a base such as Et3N to give 3-IV.
The route to prepare tetracyclic analogs containing a cyclic urea ring such as 4-VIII and 4-IX are described in Scheme 4.
In some embodiments, the acid of the N-Boc derivative 4-I is converted into the primary amide 4-II using, for example EDCI, HOBt and NH4Cl in a suitable solvent such as THF. N-alkylation as described for Scheme 1 then affords 4-III. In some embodiments, the sequence of reactions is reversed such that the N-alkylation precedes the primary amide formation. Reduction of the primary amide using BH3.DMS in THF yields the primary amine 4-IV and cyclization then yields the unsubstituted oxazolidinone 4-VIII. Alternatively, the Boc group of 4-IV is removed under acidic conditions to give 4-VI or the primary amine of 4-IV is Boc-protected (to yield 4-V) and then both Boc groups are removed to give 4-VI. In some embodiments, reductive amination of an aldehyde with 4-IV is used to introduce a substituent on the primary amine (to give 4-VII). Cyclization of 4-VI using, for example, CDI and Et3N in THF yields the tetracycle 4-VIII and N-alkylation using a base such as NaH in THF followed by reaction with an electrophile then provides compounds of general structure 4-IX. An alternate procedure involves intermediate 4-VII that can be deprotected under acidic conditions to remove the Boc group and the diamine cyclize with CDI as above to generate 4-IX.
In some embodiments, substituted tryptophans such as compounds 5-I are used to prepare compounds described herein.
Procedures to introduce substituents α- to the amino acid to give compounds such as 5-I have been described (Scheme 5; see for example Schirlin et al, J. Med. Chem., 1988, 31, p 30 and Zembower et al J. Med. Chem., 1993, 36, p 305). Using the chemistry described in the schemes 1-4 above, compounds such as 5-II, 5-III and 5-IV may be synthesized.
In some embodiments, substituted tryptophans such as compounds 6-I are used to prepare compounds described herein.
Tryptophan derivatives (e.g. Scheme 6, 6-I) containing substituents in the benzylic position may be prepared by alkylation of 3-indole acetic acid esters or nitrile derivatives (Anderson et al, Tet Lett., 1997, 38, 317) or they can be prepared directly from 3-H indoles (Reddy et al, org. Letts., 2002, 4, 695). Procedures to introduce substituents at the benzylic position of the amino acid side-chain to give compounds such as 6-I have been described (X═OH; see for example Crich and Banerjee, J. Org. Chem., 2006, 71, p 7106). Using the chemistry described in the schemes 1-4 above, compounds such as 6-II, 6-III and 6-IV may be synthesized. When the substituent R3 is OH it can be oxidized to produce a carbonyl and then further reacted e.g. with an alkyl lithium or Grignard reagent to introduce a tertiary alcohol (R3═OH; R4=alkyl).
In some embodiments, the synthesis of compounds described herein includes the steps outlined in Scheme 7.
In some embodiments, introduction of a double bond in the tetrahydro-b-carboline derivatives 7-I is achieved by oxidation using, for example, selenium dioxide to afford compounds of general structure 7-II (Scheme 7; c.f. Gatta, J. Heterocyclic Chem., 1987, 24, p 1183). Alternative methods to achieve this transformation involve dehydration of the hydroxyl derivative (R3═OH), or benzylic bromination (to give R3═Br) followed by elimination using a base such as DBU.
In some embodiments, compounds described herein are synthesized as outlined in the Examples.
Certain Terminology
Unless otherwise stated, the following terms used in this application have the definitions given below. The use of the term “including” as well as other forms, such as “include”, “includes,” and “included,” is not limiting. The section headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the subject matter described.
As used herein, C1-Cx includes C1-C2, C1-C3 . . . C1-Cx. By way of example only, a group designated as “C1-C4” indicates that there are one to four carbon atoms in the moiety, i.e. groups containing 1 carbon atom, 2 carbon atoms, 3 carbon atoms or 4 carbon atoms.

In certain embodiments, the compositions containing the compound(s) described herein are administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In certain therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest at least one of the symptoms of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. Therapeutically effective amounts are optionally determined by methods including, but not limited to, a dose escalation and/or dose ranging clinical trial.
In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a “prophylactically effective amount or dose.” In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. When used in patients, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. In one aspect, prophylactic treatments include administering to a mammal, who previously experienced at least one symptom of the disease being treated and is currently in remission, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in order to prevent a return of the symptoms of the disease or condition.
In certain embodiments wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds are administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition.
In certain embodiments wherein a patient's status does improve, the dose of drug being administered is temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a “drug holiday”). In specific embodiments, the length of the drug holiday is between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, or more than 28 days.

Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, in specific embodiments, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, is reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. In certain embodiments, however, the patient requires intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.
The amount of a given agent that corresponds to such an amount varies depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight, sex) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but nevertheless is determined according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated.
In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment are typically in the range of 0.01 mg-5000 mg per day. In one aspect, doses employed for adult human treatment are from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg per day. In one embodiment, the desired dose is conveniently presented in a single dose or in divided doses administered simultaneously or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.
In one embodiment, the daily dosages appropriate for the compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are from about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg per body weight. In some embodiments, the daily dosage or the amount of active in the dosage form are lower or higher than the ranges indicated herein, based on a number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime. In various embodiments, the daily and unit dosages are altered depending on a number of variables including, but not limited to, the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens are determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD50 and the ED50. The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it is expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. In certain embodiments, the data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies are used in formulating the therapeutically effective daily dosage range and/or the therapeutically effective unit dosage amount for use in mammals, including humans. In some embodiments, the daily dosage amount of the compounds described herein lies within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. In certain embodiments, the daily dosage range and/or the unit dosage amount varies within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.
In some embodiments, male reproductive tissue toxicity can be assessed in suitable in vivo models. In some embodiments, male reproductive tissue toxicity is assessed by monitoring any decreases in the testes weight and/or epididymis weight. For example, in a suitable rat male reproductive tissue toxicity study, Compounds (1-5), racemic (1-30) and racemic (1-33) exhibited undesired decreases in testes weight whereas Compounds (1-1) and (1-15) did not exhibit the same effects. In some embodiments, no decreases in the testes weight (as a percentage of body weight) were observed for Compounds (1-1) and (1-15) when dosed at 300 mpk PO for 5 days
