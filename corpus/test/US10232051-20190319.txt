FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to the preparation of novel linkers used for the specific conjugation of compounds, in particular, cytotoxic agents to a biological molecule. The present invention also relates to methods of making cell-binding agent-drug (cytotoxic agent) conjugates in a specific manner comprising either modification of drugs with these linkers first, followed by reaction with prepared cell-binding agents; or modification of cell-binding agents with these linkers first, followed by reaction with drugs.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Proteins, specifically antibodies have been extensively used in therapeutic applications, in vitro assays as research reagents and in vivo as diagnostic tools or as therapeutic drugs (Gad, S. C. Drug discovery handbook, published by Wiley-Interscience, 2005). For many applications the protein needs to be modified with an interesting group, such as a cytotoxic drug, a radio label element or a chromphore molecule for use in therapy or a detection agent when used in diagnostics (Teicher, B. A. et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 2011, 17, 6389-97; Elsadek, B. et al., J. Control Release, 2012, 157, 4-28). One of these applications, called antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which is the exquisite targeting ability of antibodies in combination with the cytotoxic action of anticancer agents, enables to target and deliver drugs to cancer cells leaving normal cells largely unaffected, has been intensely exploitation in the last two decades. In particular, since US FDA approvals of Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) in 2011 and Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) in 2013, the applications of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) as a promise targeted treatment of cancers have been exploded and almost every major pharmaceutical and biotech company has adopted this approach (Chari, R. et al, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 3796-3827; Sievers, E. L. et al. Annu Rev Med. 2013, 64, 15-29; Mehrling, T. Future Oncol, 2015, 11, 549). Currently there are more than 50 ADC drugs in the clinic trials according to www.clinictrails.gov.
The first-generation ADCs, including Kadcyla and Adcetris, are produced through nonselective conjugation of native lysine amines or interchain cysteine thiols on an antibody respectively to a cytotoxic drug. Since there are over 50 surface-exposed lysines and 8 hinge cysteine residues in IgG1 antibodies, this nonselective conjugation results in randomly cross-linkage of cytotoxic drugs to practically all areas of the antibody molecule, particularly having a diverse population of ADCs with a wide distribution of drugs per antibody (DAR) (Wang, L., et al. 2005 Protein Sci. 14, 2436; Hamblett, K. J., et al. 2004 Clin. Cancer Res. 10, 7063). Thus some of the undesired ADC subpopulation could lead to shorter circulation half-life, lower efficacy, potentially increased off-target toxicity and a wide range of in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) properties (Hamblett, K. J. et al, Clin. Cancer Res. 2004, 10, 7063-7070; Adem, Y. T. et al, Bioconjugate Chem. 2014, 25, 656-664; Boylan, N. J. Bioconjugate Chem., 2013, 24, 1008-1016; Strop, P., et al 2013 Chem. Biol. 20, 161-167). In addition, with this classical conjugation, the batch-to-batch consistency in ADC production can be challenging and may require diligent manufacturing capabilities (Wakankar, A. mAbs, 2011, 3, 161-172).
Therefore, biotechnology companies and academic institutions are highly focusing on establishing novel reliable methods for site-specific ADC conjugation. So far, there are several approaches developed in recent years for site selective ADC preparation (Panowski, S, 2014, mAbs 6, 34). They include incorporation of unpaired cysteines, e.g. engineered reactive cysteine residues, called THIOMAB from Genentech (Junutula, J. R., et al 2010 Clin. Cancer Res. 16, 4769; Junutula, J. R., et al 2008 Nat Biotechnol. 26, 925-32; U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,309,300; 7,855,275; 7,521,541; 7,723,485, WO2008/141044), genetically introduced glutamine tag with Streptoverticillium mobaraense transglutaminase (mTG) (Strop, P., Bioconjugate Chem., 2014, 25, 855-862; Strop, P., et al., 2013, Chem. Biol. 20, 161-167; U.S. Pat. No. 8,871,908 for Rinat-Pfizer) or with Microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) (Dennler, P., et al, 2014, Bioconjug. Chem. 25, 569-578. US pat appl 20130189287 for Innate Pharma; U.S. Pat. No. 7,893,019 for Bio-Ker S.r.l. (IT)), incorporation of thiolfucose (Dennler, P., et al, 2014 Bioconjugate Chemistry 25, 569; Okeley, N. M., et al 2013 Bioconjugate Chem. 24, 1650), incorporation of unnatural amino acids through mutagenesis (Axup, J. Y., et al., 2012, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 109, 16101-16106; Zimmerman, E. S., et al., 2014, Bioconjug. Chem. 25, 351-361; Wu, P., et al, 2009 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 106, 3000-3005; Rabuka, D., et al, 2012 Nat. Protoc. 7, 1052-67; U.S. Pat.

No. 8,916,159 for US National Cancer Institute), Convertion of cysteines located in the CXPXR consensus sequence to formylglycine (FGly) with formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) (Drake, P. M., et al., 2014, Bioconjug. Chem. 25, 1331-1341. Carrico; Isaac S. et al U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,985,783; 8,097,701; 8,349,910, and US Pat Appl 20140141025, 20100210543 for Redwood Bioscience), and through glycoengineeringly introduction of sialic acid with the use of galactosyl- and sialytransferases (Zhou, Q., et al 2014, Bioconjug. Chem., 25, 510-520, US Pat Appl 20140294867 for Sanofi-Genzyme). These above methods have produced nearly homogeneous product profiles, but they are required antibody-engineering processes and reoptimization of cell culture conditions. Moreover, expression yields for genetic encoding of an unnatural amino acid were typically not promisingly high enough (Tian, F., et al, 2014, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 111, 1766-71) which has a significant impact on the cost of goods of the ADC. In addition, it has been known that ADCs obtained by conjugation to cysteine side chains often display limited stability in circulation, leading to premature disconnection of the cytotoxic payload before the tumor site is reached (Junutula, J. R., et al 2008, Nat. Biotechnol. 26, 925-32).
The disulfide bond structures of the four subclasses of IgG antibodies were known in the 1960s (Milstein C. Biochem J 1966, 101:338-351; Pink J R, Milstein C. Nature 1967, 214:92-94; Frangione B, Milstein C. Nature 1967, 216:939-941; Pink J R, Milstein C. Nature 1967, 216:941-942; Frangione B, et al. Biochem J 1968, 106, 15-21; Frangione B, Milstein C. J Mol Biol 1968; 33:893-906; Edelman G M, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1969; 63:78-85; Frangione B, et al. Nature 196, 221:145-148, Spiegelberg, H. L. et al Biochemistry, 1975, 10, 2157-63). Disulfide bond structure is critical for the structure, stability, and biological functions of IgG molecules. Among the four subclasses of IgG antibodies, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, each IgG contains a total of 12 intra-chain disulfide bonds; each disulfide bond is associated with an individual IgG domain. The two heavy chains are connected in the hinge region by a variable number of disulfide bonds: 2 for IgG1 and IgG4, 4 for IgG2 and 11 for IgG3. The light chain of the IgG1 is connected to the heavy chain by a disulfide bond between the last cysteine residue of the light chain and the fifth cysteine residue of the heavy chain. But, for IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, the light chain is linked to the heavy chain by a disulfide bond between the last cysteine residue of the light chain and the third cysteine residue of the heavy chain (Liu, H. and May, K., 2012, mAbs 4, 17-23). On the ranks of the susceptibility of disulfide bonds in human IgG1 antibodies by experimental reduction, differential alkylation, and LC-MS analysis (Liu, H, et al Anal. Chem., 2010, 82, 5219-5226), inter chain disulfide bonds are more susceptible to reduction than intra chain disulfide bonds, and the disulfide bonds between the light chain and heavy chain were more susceptible than disulfide bonds between the two heavy chains. The upper disulfide bond of the two inter heavy chain disulfide bonds was more susceptible than the lower one. Furthermore, disulfide bonds in the CH2 domain were the most susceptible to reduction. Disulfide bonds in VL, CL, VH, and CH1 domains had similar and moderate susceptibility, while disulfide bonds in the CH3 domain were the least susceptible to reduction (Liu, H, et al Anal. Chem., 2010, 82, 5219-5226).
Based on the more susceptibility of inter chain disulfide bonds in human IgG1 antibodies, several institutions and companies adopted the chemically specific conjugation strategy through rebridging reduced interchain disulfide bonds of a native antibody, such as, using bromo or dibromo-maleimides, called next generation maleimides (NGMs) (Schumacher, F. F., et al 2014, Org. Biomol. Chem. 12, 7261-7269; UCL Cancer Institute), applying bis-alkylating reagents via a three-carbon bridge (Badescu, G., et al., 2014, Bioconjug. Chem. 25, 1124-1136., WO2013/190272, WO2014/064424 for PolyTherics Ltd), with di-substituted heteroaryl bridge (US Pat Appl. 2015/0105539 for Concortis Biosystem), or through di-maleimide as a bridge (WO2014/114207). We have also used bromo maleimide and dibromomaleimide linkers to conjugate both drugs and antibodies for a quite while (WO2014/009774, PCT/IB2012/053554). However, these above bridge linkers were designed in the way to conjugate only one cytotoxic agents to a pair of disulfide bonds, and therefore at most of time they only produced ADCs at DAR less than 2 (drugs per antibody), due to limited numbers (about two pairs) of reduced disulfide bonds are more accessible for conjugation.
As one of the major issues for ADCs is the limited numbers or amount of cytotoxic compound that ultimately reaches the tumor, and the favorable DAR over 3 is much important factor for improvement of ADC therapeutical index (Epenetos, A. A. et al, Cancer Res., 1986, 46, 3183-3191; Chari, R. V. Acc. Chem. Res., 2008, 41, 98-107, Zhao, R. Y. et al, 2011, J. Med. Chem. 54, 3606-3623), we therefore disclose novel acetylenedicarboxyl linkers of this invention that not only are able to conjugate two or more drugs per linker for achieving higher DARs (≥4), but also can selectively rebridge pairs of reduced inter chain disulfide bonds on surface of antibody due to the nature of stretch-out triple bond of the acetylenedicarboxyl group, particularly when two cytotoxic agents are linked at both ends of the stretch-out bridge linker, forming a quite large size (>20 Å) of molecule which in turn hardly accesses to the other disulfide bond sites, such as reduced intra chain disulfide bonds beneath the antibodies. The acetylenedicarboxyl linkers of this invention therefore can be used for selective bridging the pairs of free thiols on the inter chain of antibody, which are generated by overloaded TCEP or DTT, and for producing an ADC having DAR (drugs per antibody) over four. And the over reduced pairs of thiol groups that are inaccessibly reached by the bridge linkers, particularly by the stretch-out acetylenedicarboxyl linkers containing two cytotoxic agents, can be recoupled (regenerated) by an oxide, e.g. dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) or Cu(II), to form back disulfide bonds at the end of conjugation. In a word, these bridge linkers of the invention can make homogeneous production of specific ADCs in a simple manner.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides linkers containing an acetylenedicarboxylic group to link two drugs to a cell-binding agent (e.g., an antibody). The preferred formula of the cell-binding molecule-linker-drug conjugates can be represented as: wherein Cb is a cell-binding agent, L is a acetylenedicarboxyl linker, Drug1 and Drug2 are a drug molecule, n is an integer from 1 to 20, and two S (sulfur) elements from Cb bridgely link to L, which covalently connects two or more drugs (per bridge linker L). The advantages in applying the linker in the cell molecule-drug conjugate are: a). Retaining the stability of the conjugates by covalently cross-linking (rebridging) the pairs of reduced disulfur atoms of the cell-binding agents, particularly of antibodies; b). Enabling conjugation of the cytotoxic agents/drugs to specific sites of a cell-binding molecule, e.g. the inter chain disulfide bond sites of IgG antibodies, resulting in homogeneous production of ADC.
In one aspect of the present invention, the linker is represented by Formula (I)

Additionally R1 and R2 are respectively a chain of atoms selected from C, N, O, S, Si, and P, preferably having 0-500 atoms, which covalently connects to X1 or X2 and Z1 or Z2. The atoms used in forming the R1 and R2 may be combined in all chemically relevant ways, such as forming alkylene, alkenylene, and alkynylene, ethers, polyoxyalkylene, esters, amines, imines, polyamines, hydrazines, hydrazones, amides, ureas, semicarbazides, carbazides, alkoxyamines, alkoxylamines, urethanes, amino acids, peptides, acyloxylamines, hydroxamic acids, or combination thereof.

In another aspect, this invention provides a cell-binding agent-drug conjugate of Formula (II), in which the cell-binding agent, Cb, and the drug, Drug1 and Drug2, have reacted at the ends of the bridge linker:
wherein:
Cb represents a cell-binding agent, preferred an antibody;

The sulfur atoms are preferred pairs of thiols reduced from the interchain disulfide bonds of the cell-binding agent by a reduction agent, such as DTT and/or TCEP;

n is 1˜20; R1, R2, X1 and X2 are described the same previously in Formula (I).
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a modified cell-binding agent of Formula (III), in which the cell-binding agent, Cb, through its pair of thiols generated with reduction of disulfide bonds, has reacted with the bridge linker, which has Z1 and Z2, the function groups capable of reacting with a drug:
Wherein Cb, Z1, Z2, n, R1, R2, X1, and X2 are defined the same as in Formula (I) and (II).
In an even further aspect, the present invention provides a modified drug of Formula (IV), in which the drug, Drug1 and Drug2, have reacted with the linker of Formula (I), which still has the acetylenedicarboxyl group capable of reacting with a pair of sulfur atoms of the cell-binding agent:

Cell-Binding Agent-Drug Conjugates
The conjugates of the present invention can be represented by the following formula, wherein Cb is a cell-binding agent, L is the acetylenedicarboxyl bridge linker, Drug1 and Drug2 are a drug molecule, n is an integer from 1 to 20, and two S (sulfur) elements from Cb bridgely link to L, which covalently connects two or more drugs (per bridge linker L).
The bridge linker L may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl (“MC”), maleimidopropanoyl (“MP”), valine-citrulline (“val-cit” or “vc”), alanine-phenylalanine (“ala-phe” or “af”), p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (“PAB”), 4-thiopentanoate (“SPP”), 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 carboxylate (“MCC”), (4-acetyl)aminobenzoate (“SIAB”), 4-thio-butyrate (SPDB), 4-thio-2-hydroxysulfonyl-butyrate (2-Sulfo-SPDB), ethyleneoxy —CH2CH2O— as one or more repeating units (“EO” or “PEO”). Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein.
Example structures of these components containing linkers are:
Preferably, the conjugates have the following Formula (II):
wherein:
Cb represents a cell-binding agent, preferably an antibody, which conjugates to Drug1 and Drug2 via a pair of sulfur atoms (thiols). The conjugatable thiol groups can generally be generated from TCEP or DTT reduction of pairs of disulfide bonds on the surface of cell-binding molecule.
Drug1 and Drug2 represent the same or different cytotoxic agents, linked to the cell-binding agent via the bridge linker through an alkyl, alkylene, alkenylene, alkynylene, ether, polyoxyalkylene, ester, amine, imine, polyamine, hydrazine, hydrazone, amide, urea, semicarbazide, carbazide, alkoxyamine, urethanes, amino acid, peptide, acyloxylamine, hydroxamic acid, disulfide, thioether, thioester, carbamate, carbonate, heterocyclic ring, heteroalkyl, heteroaromatic, or alkoxime bond, or combination thereof.
n is 1˜20; R1, R2, X1 and X2 are described the same previously in Formula (I).
As described in more detail below, Drug1 and Drug2 can be any of many small molecule drugs, including, but not limited to, tubulysins, calicheamicins, auristatins, maytansinoids, CC-1065 analogs, morpholinos doxorubicins, taxanes, cryptophycins, epothilones, and benzodiazepine dimers (e.g., dimmers of pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) or tomaymycin), indolinobenzodiazepines, imidazobenzothiadiazepines, or oxazolidinobenzodiazepines).
To synthesize the conjugate, the cell-binding agent can be first modified with the bridge linkers of the present invention through reduction of disulfide bonds of the cell-binding molecule. The yielded a pair of free thiols can react to the bridge linker of Formula (I) at pH 5˜9 aqueous media with or without addition of 0˜30% of water mixable (miscible) organic solvents, such as DMA, DMF, ethanol, methanol, acetone, acetonitrile, THF, isopropanol, dioxane, propylene glycol, or ethylene diol, to introduce the reactive groups of Z1 and Z2 containing disulfide, maleimido, haloacetyl, azide, 1-yne, ketone, aldehyde, alkoxyamino, or hydrazide groups. Then a reactive group of a cytotoxic agent reacts to the modified cell-binding molecule accordingly. For example, synthesis of the cell-binding agent-drug conjugates linked via disulfide bonds is achieved by a disulfide exchange between the disulfide bond in the modified cell-binding agent and a drug containing a free thiol group. Synthesis of the cell-binding agent-drug conjugates linked via thioether is achieved by reaction of the maleimido or haloacetyl or ethylsulfonyl modified cell-binding agent and a drug containing a free thiol group. Synthesis of conjugates bearing an acid labile hydrazone can be achieved by reaction of a carbonyl group with the hydrazide moiety in the linker, by methods known in the art (see, for example, P. Hamann et al., Hinman, L. M., et al, Cancer Res. 53, 3336-334, 1993; B. Laguzza et al., J. Med. Chem., 32; 548-555, 1959; P. Trail et al., Cancer Res., 57; 100-105, 1997). Synthesis of conjugates bearing triazole linkage can be achieved by reaction of a 1-yne group of the drug with the azido moiety in the linker, through the click chemistry (Huisgen cycloaddition) (Lutz, J-F. et al, 2008, Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 60, 958-970; Sletten, E. M. et al 2011, Acc Chem. Research 44, 666-676).
Alternatively, the drug can react with the bridge linkers of the present invention that have conjugated to a cell-binding molecule to give a modified cell-binding molecule linker of Formula (III) bearing functionalities. For example, a thiol-containing drug can be reached with the modified cell-binding molecule bridge linker of Formula (III) bearing a maleimdo, or a haloacetyl, or an ethylsulfonyl substituent at pH 5.5˜9.0 in aqueous buffer to give a cell-binding molecule-drug conjugate via a thioether linkage. A thiol-containing drug can undergo disulfide exchange with a modified bridge linker of Formula (III) bearing a pyridyldithio moiety to give a conjugate a disulfide bond linkage. A drug bearing a hydroxyl group or a thiol group can be reacted with a modified bridge linker of Formula (III) bearing a halogen, particularly the alpha halide of carboxylates, in the presence of a mild base, e.g. pH 8.0˜9.5, to give a modified drug bearing an ether or thiol ether link. A hydroxyl group containing drug can be condensed with a bridge cross linker of Formula (I) bearing a carboxyl group, in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as EDC or DCC, to give ester linkage, then the subject drug modified bridge linker undergoes the conjugation with a cell-binding molecule. A drug containing an amino group can condensate with a carboxyl ester of NHS, imidazole, nitrophenol; N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS); phenol; dinitrophenol; pentafluorophenol; tetrafluorophenol; difluorophenol; monofluorophenol; pentachlorophenol; triflate; imidazole; dichlorophenol; tetrachlorophenol; 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; tosylate; mesylate; 2-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3′-sulfonate on the cell-binding molecule-bridge linker of Formula (III) to give a conjugate via amide bond linkage.
The conjugate may be purified by standard biochemical means, such as gel filtration on a Sephadex G25 or Sephacryl S300 column, adsorption chromatography, and ion exchange or by dialysis. In some cases, a small molecule as a cell-binding agent (e.g. folic acid, melanocyte stimulating hormone, EGF etc) conjugated with a small molecular drugs can be purified by chromatography such as by HPLC, medium pressure column chromatography or ion exchange chromatography.
Modified Cell-Binding Agents/Molecules
The cell-binding agent modified by reaction with linkers of the present invention are preferably represented by the Formula (III)
Wherein Cb, Z1, Z2, n, R1, R2, X1, and X2 are defined the same as in Formula (I) and (II).
In preferred embodiments, Z1 and Z2 are a disulfide substituent, maleimido, haloacetyl, alkoxyamine, azido, ketone, aldehyde, hydrazine, alkyne, an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, or a carboxyl ester formed with phenol; dinitrophenol; pentafluorophenol; tetrafluorophenol; difluorophenol; monofluorophenol; pentachlorophenol; triflate; imidazole; dichlorophenol; tetrachlorophenol; 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; tosylate; mesylate; 2-ethyl-5-phenylisoxa-zolium-3′-sulfonate. Z1 and Z2 can then react with a cytotoxic agent through disulfide, thioether, hydrazone, amide, alkoxime, carbamate, ester, ether bond or heteroaromatic ring. The modified cell-binding agent can be prepared via a reaction of the cell-binding agent with the bridge linkers of Formula (I) as described in Formula (II) above.
In order to achieve a higher conjugation yield of the alkyne group on the bridge linkers with a pair of free thiols on the cell-binding molecule, preferably on an antibody, a small percentage of organic co-solvent may be required to add to the reaction mixture, as well in the solution after the reaction to maintain solubility of the Formula (III) in aqueous solution. To modify the cell-binding agents, the cross-linking reagent (bridge linker) of Formula (I) can be first dissolved in a polar organic solvent that is miscible with water, for example different alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, and propanol, acetone, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,4-dioxane, dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl acetamide (DMA), or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a high concentration, for example 1-500 mM. Meanwhile, the cell-binding molecule, such as antibody dissolved in an aqueous buffer pH 5˜9.5, preferably pH 6˜8.5, at 1˜35 mg/ml concentration was treated with 1-20 equivalent of TCEP or DTT for 20 min to 12 hour. After the reduction, DTT can be removed by SEC chromatographic purification. TCEP can be optionally removed by SEC chromatography too, or staying in the reaction mixture for the next step reaction without purification. Furthermore, the reduction of antibodies or the other cell-binding agents with TCEP can be performed with a bridge linker of Formula (I), for which the cross-linking conjugation for the cell-binding molecules can be achieved simultaneously along with the TCEP reduction.
The aqueous solutions for the modification of cell-binding agents are buffered between pH 6 and 9, preferably between 6.5 and 7.5 and can contain any non-nucleophilic buffer salts useful for these pH ranges. Typical buffers include phosphate, triethanolamine HCl, HEPES, and MOPS buffers, which can contain additional components, such as cyclodextrins, sucrose and salts, for examples, NaCl and KCl. After the addition of the bridge linker of Formula (I) into the solution containing the reduced cell-binding molecules, the reaction mixture is incubated at a temperature of from 4° C. to 45° C., preferably at ambient temperature. The progress of the reaction can be monitored by measuring the decrease in the absorption at 254 nm, or increase in the absorption at 280 nm, or the other appropriate wavelength. After the reaction is complete, isolation of the modified cell-binding agent can be performed in a routine way, using for example gel filtration chromatography, or adsorptive chromatography.
The extent of modification can be assessed by measuring the absorbance of the nitropyridine thione, dinitropyridine dithione, pyridine thione, carboxamidopyridine dithione and dicarboxamidopyridine dithione group released via UV spectra. For the conjugation without a chromophore group, the modification or conjugation reaction can be monitored by LC-MS, preferably by UPLC-QTOF mass spectrometry, or Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS). The bridge cross-linkers described herein have diverse functional groups that can react with any drugs, preferably cytotoxic agents that possess a suitable substituent. For examples, the modified cell-binding molecules bearing an amino or hydroxyl substituent can react with drugs bearing an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester, the modified cell-binding molecules bearing a thiol substituent can react with drugs bearing a maleimido or haloacetyl group. Additionally, the modified cell-binding molecules bearing a carbonyl (ketone or aldehyde) substituent can react with drugs bearing a hydrazide or an alkoxyamine. One skilled in the art can readily determine which linker to use based on the known reactivity of the available functional group on the linkers.
Modified Cytotoxic Drugs
The cytotoxic drugs modified by reaction with cross-linkers of the present invention are preferably represented by the Formula (IV):
Wherein Drug1, Drug2, Z1, Z2, n, R1, R2, X1, and X2 are defined the same as in Formula (I) and (II).
The modified drugs can be prepared via reaction of the drug with the linkers of the Formula (I) to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing functionality of an acetylene-di-carboxyl group capable of reacting with a pair of thiol groups of a cell-binding agent. The acetylenedicarboxyl group is synthesized through condensation with acetylene via the methods described in reaction equation (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie), (If), (Ig) and (Ih). But for drugs containing a thiol, or the drugs undergoing to link a cell-binding molecule via the bridge linkers through thioether, thioester or disulfide bond, it is therefore preferred that the Drug1 or Drug2 may be synthesized to connect to R1, or R2 in a piece of components via the linkage of thioether, thioester or disulfide bond first. Then the synthesized R1-Drug1 or R2-Drug2 component is assembled to an acetylenedicarboxyl group to form the bridge linker modified drugs of Formula (IV).
For examples of the synthesis, a thiol-containing drug can be reacted with the linker of components R1 or R2 bearing a maleimdo substituent at neutral pH in aqueous buffer to give a R1-Drug1 or R2-Drug2 compartment bearing thioether linkage, and following by condensation with a compartment of acetylenedicarboxyl group to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing thioether linkage. A drug bearing a hydroxyl group can be reacted with a linker component R1 or R2 bearing a halogen, or a tosylate, or a mesylate, in the presence of a mild base, to give a R1-Drug1 or R2-Drug2 compartment bearing ether linkage, and following by condensation with a compartment of acetylenedicarboxyl group to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing thioether linkage. A hydroxyl group containing drug can be condensed with a linker of Formula (I) bearing a carboxyl group, in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as EDC or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) via ester linkage. A drug bearing a thiol group can also react the linker of components R1 or R2 bearing a maleimido or a vinylsulfonyl, or a haloacetyl group, give a R1-Drug1 or R2-Drug2 compartment bearing thioether linkage, and following by condensation with a compartment of acetylenedicarboxyl group to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing thioether linkage. An amino group containing drug can similarly undergo condensation with a carboxyl group on the bridge linker of Formula (I) to give a modified drug of Formula (IV) bearing amide bonds. The modified drug can be purified by standard methods such as column chromatography over silica gel or alumina, crystallization, preparatory thin layer chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, or HPLC.

Immunol. 131, 2895-2902 (1983)], fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR's, diabody, triabody, and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immuno-specifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens, microbial antigens or a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing, binding to a specific antigen or exhibiting the desired biological activity (Miller et al (2003) J. of Immunology 170:4854-4861); interferons (such as type I, II, III); peptides; lymphokines such as IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ); hormones such as insulin, TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormones), MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone), steroid hormones, such as androgens and estrogens, melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH); growth factors and colony-stimulating factors such as epidermal growth factors (EGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), transforming growth factors (TGF), such as TGFα, TGFβ, insulin and insulin like growth factors (IGF-I, IGF-II) G-CSF, M-CSF and GM-CSF [Burgess, Immunology Today, 5, 155-158 (1984)]; vaccinia growth factors (VGF); fibroblast growth factors (FGFs); smaller molecular weight proteins, poly-peptide, peptides and peptide hormones, such as bombesin, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide; platelet-derived growth factors; interleukin and cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factors, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); vitamins, such as folate; apoproteins and glycoproteins, such as transferrin [O'Keefe et al, 260 J. Biol. Chem. 932-937 (1985)]; sugar-binding proteins or lipoproteins, such as lectins; cell nutrient-transport molecules; and small molecular inhibitors, such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitors and small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), non-peptides or any other cell binding molecule or substance, such as bioactive polymers (Dhar, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2008, 105, 17356-61); bioactive dendrimers (Lee, et al, Nat. Biotechnol. 2005, 23, 1517-26; Almutairi, et al; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2009, 106, 685-90); nanoparticles (Liong, et al, ACS Nano, 2008, 19, 1309-12; Medarova, et al, Nat. Med. 2007, 13, 372-7; Javier, et al, Bioconjugate Chem. 2008, 19, 1309-12); liposomes (Medinai, et al, Curr. Phar. Des. 2004, 10, 2981-9); viral capsides (Flenniken, et al, Viruses Nanotechnol. 2009, 327, 71-93).
In general, a monoclonal antibody is preferred as a cell-surface binding agent if an appropriate one is available. And the antibody may be murine, human, humanized, chimeric, or derived from other species.
Production of antibodies used in the present invention involves in vivo or in vitro procedures or combinations thereof. Methods for producing polyclonal anti-receptor peptide antibodies are well-known in the art, such as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,493,795 (to Nestor et al). A monoclonal antibody is typically made by fusing myeloma cells with the spleen cells from a mouse that has been immunized with the desired antigen (Köhler, G.; Milstein, C. (1975). Nature 256: 495-497). The detailed procedures are described in “Antibodies—A Laboratory Manual”, Harlow and Lane, eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York (1988), which is incorporated herein by reference. Particularly monoclonal antibodies are produced by immunizing mice, rats, hamsters or any other mammal with the antigen of interest such as the intact target cell, antigens isolated from the target cell, whole virus, attenuated whole virus, and viral proteins. Splenocytes are typically fused with myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Fused hybrids are selected by their sensitivity to HAT (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymine). Hybridomas producing a monoclonal antibody useful in practicing this invention are identified by their ability to immunoreact specified receptors or inhibit receptor activity on target cells.
A monoclonal antibody used in the present invention can be produced by initiating a monoclonal hybridoma culture comprising a nutrient medium containing a hybridoma that secretes antibody molecules of the appropriate antigen specificity. The culture is maintained under conditions and for a time period sufficient for the hybridoma to secrete the antibody molecules into the medium. The antibody-containing medium is then collected. The antibody molecules can then be further isolated by well-known techniques, such as using protein-A affinity chromatography; anion, cation, hydrophobic, or size exclusive chromatographies (particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after protein A, and sizing column chromatography); centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.
Media useful for the preparation of these compositions are both well-known in the art and commercially available and include synthetic culture media. An exemplary synthetic medium is Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM; Dulbecco et al., Virol. 8, 396 (1959)) supplemented with 4.5 gm/l glucose, 0˜20 mM glutamine, 0˜20% fetal calf serum, several ppm amount of heavy metals, such as Cu, Mn, Fe, or Zn, etc, or/and the heavy metals added in their salt forms, and with an anti-foaming agent, such as polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer.
In addition, antibody-producing cell lines can also be created by techniques other than fusion, such as direct transformation of B lymphocytes with oncogenic DNA, or transfection with an oncovirus, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, also called human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4)) or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,341,761; 4,399,121; 4,427,783; 4,444,887; 4,451,570; 4,466,917; 4,472,500; 4,491,632; 4,493,890. A monoclonal antibody may also be produced via an anti-receptor peptide or peptides containing the carboxyl terminal as described well-known in the art. See Niman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 80: 4949-4953 (1983); Geysen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 178-182 (1985); Lei et al. Biochemistry 34(20): 6675-6688, (1995). Typically, the anti-receptor peptide or a peptide analog is used either alone or conjugated to an immunogenic carrier, as the immunogen for producing anti-receptor peptide monoclonal antibodies.
There are also a number of other well-known techniques for making monoclonal antibodies as binding molecules in this invention. Particularly useful are methods of making fully human antibodies. One method is phage display technology which can be used to select a range of human antibodies binding specifically to the antigen using methods of affinity enrichment. Phage display has been thoroughly described in the literature and the construction and screening of phage display libraries are well known in the art, see, e.g., Dente et al, Gene. 148(1):7-13 (1994); Little et al, Biotechnol Adv. 12(3):539-55 (1994); Clackson et al., Nature 352:264-628 (1991); Huse et al., Science 246:1275-1281 (1989).
Monoclonal antibodies derived by hybridoma technique from another species than human, such as mouse, can be humanized to avoid human anti-mouse antibodies when infused into humans. Among the more common methods of humanization of antibodies are complementarity-determining region grafting and resurfacing. These methods have been extensively described, see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,859,205 and 6,797,492; Liu et al, Immunol Rev. 222:9-27 (2008); Almagro et al, Front Biosci. 13: 1619-33 (2008); Lazar et al, Mol Immunol. 44(8):1986-98 (2007); Li et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 103(10):3557-62 (2006) each incorporated herein by reference. Fully human antibodies can also be prepared by immunizing transgenic mice, rabbits, monkeys, or other mammals, carrying large portions of the human immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, with an immunogen. Examples of such mice are: the Xenomouse. (Abgenix/Amgen), the HuMAb-Mouse (Medarex/BMS), the VelociMouse (Regeneron), see also U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,596,541, 6,207,418, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,150,584, 6,111,166, 6,075,181, 5,922,545, 5,661,016, 5,545,806, 5,436,149 and 5,569,825. In human therapy, murine variable regions and human constant regions can also be fused to construct called “chimeric antibodies” that are considerably less immunogenic in man than murine mAbs (Kipriyanov et al, Mol Biotechnol. 26:39-60 (2004); Houdebine, Curr Opin Biotechnol. 13:625-9 (2002) each incorporated herein by reference). In addition, site-directed mutagenesis in the variable region of an antibody can result in an antibody with higher affinity and specificity for its antigen (Brannigan et al, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 3:964-70, (2002)); Adams et al, J Immunol Methods. 231:249-60 (1999)) and exchanging constant regions of a mAb can improve its ability to mediate effector functions of binding and cytotoxicity.
Antibodies immunospecific for a malignant cell antigen can also be obtained commercially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding antibodies immunospecific for a malignant cell antigen can be obtained commercially, e.g., from the GenBank database or a database like it, the literature publications, or by routine cloning and sequencing.
Apart from an antibody, a peptide or protein that bind/block/target or in some other way interact with the epitopes or corresponding receptors on a targeted cell can be used as a binding molecule. These peptides or proteins could be any random peptide or proteins that have an affinity for the epitopes or corresponding receptors and they don't necessarily have to be of the immunoglobulin family. These peptides can be isolated by similar techniques as for phage display antibodies (Szardenings, J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2003; 23(4):307-49). The use of peptides from such random peptide libraries can be similar to antibodies and antibody fragments. The binding molecules of peptides or proteins may be conjugated on or linked to a large molecules or materials, such as, but is not limited, an albumin, a polymer, a liposome, a nano particle, a dendrimer, as long as such attachment permits the peptide or protein to retain its antigen binding specificity.

According to a further object, the present invention also concerns pharmaceutical compositions comprising the conjugate via the bridge linkers of the invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient for treatment of cancers, infections or autoimmune disorders. The method for treatment of cancers, infections and autoimmune disorders can be practiced in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo. Examples of in vitro uses include treatments of cell cultures in order to kill all cells except for desired variants that do not express the target antigen; or to kill variants that express undesired antigen. Examples of ex vivo uses include treatments of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) prior to the performance of the transplantation (HSCT) into the same patient in order to kill diseased or malignant cells. For instance, clinical ex vivo treatment to remove tumour cells or lymphoid cells from bone marrow prior to autologous transplantation in cancer treatment or in treatment of autoimmune disease, or to remove T cells and other lymphoid cells from allogeneic bone marrow or tissue prior to transplant in order to prevent graft-versus-host disease, can be carried out as follows. Bone marrow is harvested from the patient or other individual and then incubated in medium containing serum to which is added the conjugate of the invention, concentrations range from about 1 pM to 0.1 mM, for about 30 minutes to about 48 hours at about 37° C. The exact conditions of concentration and time of incubation (=dose) are readily determined by the skilled clinicians. After incubation, the bone marrow cells are washed with medium containing serum and returned to the patient by i.v. infusion according to known methods. In circumstances where the patient receives other treatment such as a course of ablative chemotherapy or total-body irradiation between the time of harvest of the marrow and reinfusion of the treated cells, the treated marrow cells are stored frozen in liquid nitrogen using standard medical equipment.
For clinical in vivo use, the conjugate via the linkers of the invention will be supplied as solutions or as a lyophilized solid that can be redissolved in sterile water for injection. Examples of suitable protocols of conjugate administration are as follows. Conjugates are given weekly for 8˜20 weeks as an i.v. bolus. Bolus doses are given in 50 to 500 ml of normal saline to which human serum albumin (e.g. 0.5 to 1 mL of a concentrated solution of human serum albumin, 100 mg/mL) can be added. Dosages will be about 50 μg to 20 mg/kg of body weight per week, i.v. (range of 10 μg to 200 mg/kg per injection). 4˜20 weeks after treatment, the patient may receive a second course of treatment. Specific clinical protocols with regard to route of administration, excipients, diluents, dosages, times, etc., can be determined by the skilled clinicians.
Examples of medical conditions that can be treated according to the in vivo or ex vivo methods of killing selected cell populations include malignancy of any types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, graft rejections, and infections (viral, bacterial or parasite).
The amount of a conjugate which is required to achieve the desired biological effect, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the chemical characteristics, the potency, and the bioavailability of the conjugates, the type of disease, the species to which the patient belongs, the diseased state of the patient, the route of administration, all factors which dictate the required dose amounts, delivery and regimen to be administered.
In general terms, the conjugates via the linkers of this invention may be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing 0.1 to 10% w/v conjugates for parenteral administration. Typical dose ranges are from 1 μg/kg to 0.1 g/kg of body weight per day; a preferred dose range is from 0.01 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg of body weight per day, or per week, or an equivalent dose in a human child. The preferred dosage of drug to be administered is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, the formulation of the compound, the route of administration (intravenous, intramuscular, or other), the pharmacokinetic properties of the conjugates by the chosen delivery route, and the speed (bolus or continuous infusion) and schedule of administrations (number of repetitions in a given period of time).
The conjugates via the linkers of the present invention are also capable of being administered in unit dose forms, wherein the term “unit dose” means a single dose which is capable of being administered to a patient, and which can be readily handled and packaged, remaining as a physically and chemically stable unit dose comprising either the active conjugate itself, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, as described hereinafter. As such, typical total daily/weekly/biweekly/monthly dose ranges are from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of body weight. By way of general guidance, unit doses for humans range from 1 mg to 3000 mg per day, or per week, per two week or per month. Preferably the unit dose range is from 1 to 500 mg administered one to four times a week, and even more preferably from 1 mg to 100 mg, once a week. Conjugates provided herein can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by admixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Such unit dose compositions may be prepared for use by oral administration, particularly in the form of tablets, simple capsules or soft gel capsules; or intranasal, particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols; or dermally, for example, topically in ointments, creams, lotions, gels or sprays, or via trans-dermal patches.

Example 18. In Vitro Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Conjugates 91 and 93 in Comparison with T-DM1
The cell lines used in the cytotoxicity assays were HL-60, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line; NCI-N87, a human gastric carcinoma cell line; BT-474, a human invasive ductal carcinoma cell line; and SKOV3, a human ovarian carcinoma cell line. For HL-60, NCI-N87, and BT-474 cells, the cells were grown in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS. For SKOV3 cells, the cells were grown in McCoy's 5A Medium with 10% FBS. To run the assay, the cells (180 μl, 6000 cells) were added to each well in a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. with 5% CO2. Next, the cells were treated with test compounds (20 μl) at various concentrations in appropriate cell culture medium (total volume, 0.2 mL). The control wells contain cells and the medium but lack the test compounds. The plates were incubated for 120 hours at 37° C. with 5% CO2. MTT (5 mg/ml) was then added to the wells (20 μl) and the plates were incubated for 1.5 hr at 37° C. The medium was carefully removed and DMSO (180 μl) was added afterward. After it was shaken for 15 min, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm and 570 nm with a reference filter of 620 nm. The inhibition % was calculated according to the following equation: inhibition %=[1−(assay−blank)/(control−blank)]×100.
The cytotoxicity results:
IC50 (nM)  N87 cell (Ag+)  SK-OV-3 cell (Ag+)  HL60 cell (Ag+)
Conjugate 91  0.108 nM  0.089 nM  >20 nM
Conjugate 93  0.037 nM  0.029 nM  >10 nM
T-DM1  0.270 nM  0.191 nM  >15 nM
Specificity of conjugate 91 for N87 cell was over 185 (IC50>20/IC50=0.108), and for SK-OV-3 cell was over 225; Specificity of conjugate 93 for N87 cell was over 270 (IC50>10/IC50=0.037), and for SK-OV-3 cell was over 344; Specificity of conjugate T-DM1 for N87 cell was over 55 (IC50>15/IC50=0.27), and for SK-OV-3 cell was over 78.
Both conjugate 91 and conjugate 93 were extremely more potent than the commercial conjugate T-DM1. The conjugate 93 having DAR=8 was three-fold more potent than conjugate 91 having DAR=4.
Example 19. Antitumor Activity In Vivo
The in vivo efficacy of conjugates 91 and 93 along with T-DM1 were evaluated in a human gastric carcinoma N-87 cell line tumor xenograft models. Five-week-old female BALB/c Nude mice (24 animals) were inoculated subcutaneously in the area under the right shoulder with N-87 carcinoma cells (5×106 cells/mouse) in 0.1 mL of serum-free medium. The tumors were grown for 8 days to an average size of 130 mm3. The animals were then randomly divided into 4 groups (6 animals per group). The first group of mice served as the control group and was treated with the phosphate-buffered saline vehicle. The remaining three groups were treated with conjugates 91, 93 and T-DM1 respectively at dose of 5 mg/Kg administered intravenously. Three dimensions of the tumor were measured every 4 days and the tumor volumes were calculated using the formula tumor volume=1/2 (length×width×height). The weight of the animals was also measured at the same time. A mouse was sacrificed when any one of the following criteria was met: (1) loss of body weight of more than 20% from pretreatment weight, (2) tumor volume larger than 1500 mm3, (3) too sick to reach food and water, or (4) skin necrosis. A mouse was considered to be tumor-free if no tumor was palpable.
The results were plotted in FIG. 11 . All the three conjugates compounds did not cause the animal body weight loss. And the animals at control group were sacrificed at day 38 due to the tumor volume larger than 1500 mm3 and all control animals were too sick. All 6/6 animals at the group of compound 93 had completely no tumor measurable at day 14˜18 till day 60 (the end of experiment). All 6/6 animals at the group of Compound 91 group had no tumor measurable at day 14˜22 and 2/6 animals had tumor growth (measurable) back at days 42 and 50. In contrast only 2/6 animals at the group of T-DM1 had no tumor measurable at days 14 and 22 until day 38 and 50.
