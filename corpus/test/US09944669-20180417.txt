FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to hybrid fumarate-CO-releasing molecules capable of activating heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity and HO-1 protein expression, their synthesis and their use in therapeutic applications, in particular their use in the treatment of inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases.
BACKGROUND ART
The HO-1/CO system is a significant part of the defense against the damage inflicted by a variety of stress conditions mediated by heavy metals, reactive oxygen species, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other inflammatory processes, thereby playing a pivotal role in the regulation of the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory responses.
CO gas administered at low doses (250 ppm) for restricted period of times has been shown to reproduce (restore) many of the beneficial effects of HO-1 in models of cardiovascular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and inflammatory bowel disease.
Because of the interest in HO-1/CO therapeutic potential, compounds that liberate controlled amounts of CO (CO-releasing molecules, CO-RMs) to biological systems have been developed and demonstrated to exert a wide array of pharmacological effects related to CO release. The vast majority of pharmacologically active CO-RMs described in the literature are metal carbonyls containing either Ru, Fe, Mn, Co and Mo.
The transcription factor Nrf2 is a crucial initiator of the cellular stress response as it co-ordinates the expression of several antioxidant and detoxification genes that repair damage and restore cellular homeostasis. As part of this inducible response, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) plays a prominent role by utilizing heme to produce CO, biliverdin/bilirubin and iron, important signaling and protective molecules against oxidative stress and inflammation.
Many chemicals have been identified to act as Nrf2/HO-1 activators and among them several naturally-derived compounds having an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl functionality, including curcumin, the first chemical found to increase HO-1 expression, and chalcones. The list of Nrf2/HO-1 activators has now grown to include several hundred compounds. Because of their mechanism of action, Nrf2/HO-1 activators require time to mount the cellular stress response, resulting in a delayed, albeit essential, beneficial effect.
The synthesis of a molecule possessing both the ability to rapidly release CO and simultaneously stimulate a longer-lasting Nrf2-dependent protective proteome, offers significant therapeutic advantages compared to CO-RMs or Nrf2 activating agents alone in diseases where these pathways are crucial for tissue protection, and there is therefore a need for such molecules.
Zhu et al. (J. Organomet. Chem. 2006, 691, 485-490) discloses compound [Co2(CO6)(μH2CCH2O)—]2(CO)2, however referring only to its use in mixed metal linked alkyne bridged butterfly clusters containing C2Co2R2, with applications in the synthesis of polymeric materials.
WO 2012/076696 discloses curcumin derivatives bound to a CO-releasing molecule. The inventors of the present invention have however shown that these molecules do not release carbon monoxide. This lack of CO-release results in molecules that do not exhibit the wide array of beneficial therapeutic effects related to the activation of HO-1 by CO.
WO 2008/003953 also describes CO-releasing molecules of formula (I): Mn(CO)4XY wherein X and Y are monodentate ligands, or taken together form a bidentate ligand, for the therapeutic delivery of CO to humans and animals. More specifically, WO 2008/003953 discloses CO-releasing compound 364, wherein X represents O(O)CCH2CH2C(O)OH and Y represents Br. However, this molecule demonstrated poor CO-releasing abilities.
Unexpectedly, it has been discovered that hybrid molecules comprising a fumarate moiety and a CO-releasing molecule (CORM) are capable of rapidly liberating CO and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, resulting in a dual activation of the inflammatory defenses in cells and an improved therapeutic efficacy.
The present invention concerns both compounds with one CORM moiety (mono-CORM compounds) and with two CORM moieties (bi-CORM compounds). The inventors have discovered that both types of molecules have improved therapeutic activities. Moreover, it has been observed that mono-CORM molecules release very quickly high levels of CO, thus exerting a “burst effect”. On the other hand, bi-CORM compounds release higher levels of CO (in particular because of the presence of a second CORM moiety), but less rapidly and over a longer period of time. Therefore, mono-CORM compounds of the invention will be used when a “burst effect” is sought for, while bi-CORM compounds of the invention will be used when a sustained release over a long period of time is more appropriate for the patient or with regard to the disease or condition to be treated.

Example 2: Assessment of CO-Release by Compounds of the Invention
Assessment of CO-Release in Myoglobin Oxidation Assay by Compounds A and B:
Myoglobin (lyophilized horse heart; 44 μM final concentration) was prepared in 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) in a cuvette from a 500 μM stock solution and converted to deoxymyoglobin (deoxyMb) by adding sodium dithionite. The solution was maintained at 37° C. in the spectrophotometer chamber throughout the assay using a JASCO temperature controller. A deoxyMb spectrum was recorded, revealing a characteristic peak at 560 nm. A 2-fold excess of a CO—RM molecule was then added to the cuvette to obtain a maximum carbonmonoxy-myoglobin (Mb-CO) spectrum (saturated Mb-CO). As expected for Mb-CO spectra, typical absorption peaks at 542 and 576 nm were observed. The release of CO from compound A, compound B (30 μM) or the curcumin-CO—RM according to WO 2012/076696 (30 μM) of the following formula: was measured by adding the compounds to 44 μM deoxyMb and the solution overlaid with 400 μl olive oil to prevent loss of CO or oxygen diffusion, which would compete with CO binding to myoglobin. Samples were scanned immediately after addition of the compounds and at consecutive time-points to monitor the formation of Mb-CO (μM).
Raw Mb-CO data were corrected using a 4-point non-linear regression method to compensate for a shift in absorbance due to the CO-releasing compounds. The concentration of Mb-CO at each time-point was calculated using the absorbance values at 540 nm and the extinction coefficient derived from the saturated Mb-CO spectrum, as described previously.5 Mb-CO concentrations (μM) were plotted against time (min) and t1/2 were determined using GraphPad Prism software version 5.0 (San Diego, Calif.) by applying a Boltzmann sigmoidal non-linear regression curve fit. t1/2 represent the time taken for the concentration of Mb-CO to equal half the maximum Mb-CO formed under the assay conditions.
The presence of absorption peaks at 540 and 578 nm indicates the formation of MbCO by the carbon monoxide released by the CO—RM molecules.
The results are presented in FIG. 1A-C .
As shown by these results, compound A and compound B release carbon monoxide whereas the curcumin derivative according to WO 2012/076696 does not.
The amount of CO released was also measured as a function of time for compounds A and B. The results are presented in FIG. 6 .
The results indicate that compound A liberates CO with a faster rate compared to compound B, but the amount of CO finally liberated is much higher in the case of compound B in accordance with the presence of two bi-metallic carbonyl complexes.
It can thus be concluded that the monometallic hybrids of formula (Ia) release CO at a faster rate compared to the bi-metallic hybrid of formula (Ic), but the amount of CO finally released is much higher in the case of compound (Ic), in accordance with the presence of two bi-metallic carbonyl complexes. The compounds of formula (Ia) are therefore advantageous for a fast biological activity (burst effect). However, since the bi-metallic hybrids of formula (Ic) are able to release more CO over a longer period of time, they are advantageous for a sustained biological activity.
Detection of CO in BV2 Microglia Exposed to Compound C in COP-1 Assay
In order to detect the CO release, BV2 microglia cells (106 cells/ml) were washed once, incubated with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and then treated for 15 min in the dark at 37° C. with compound C and comparative compound CORM-401 according to WO 2008/003953 (5 μM) of the following formula: Comparative compound CORM 401. Cells were then loaded with the CO sensitive fluorescent probe COP-1 (0.001 mM) for 30 min in the dark at 3TC. Results were expressed as the corrected mean fluorescence intensity (MFIc) using flow cytometry. MFIc=MFIstained treated cells−MFICOP-1 backgound.
The results are presented in FIG. 1D .
As shown by these results, compound C releases significantly more carbon monoxide than the comparative compound CORM-401 according to WO 2008/003953.
These results demonstrate that the fumarate moiety of the compounds of the invention induces a positive effect on in cellulo carbon monoxide release. Moreover, these results demonstrate that the combination of a fumarate moiety with a CO-releasing molecule (CORM) has a synergistic action on carbon monoxide release.

Example 3.1a: Assessment of Heme Oxygenase Activity with Compounds A and B
Heme oxygenase activity was determined by a spectrophotometric assay that measures the formation of bilirubin as a difference in absorbance between 464 and 530 nm (extinction coefficient for bilirubin 40 mM−1·cm−1). BV2 microglia was incubated with increasing concentrations of compound A for 6 h. Following incubation, cells were harvested in ice cold PBS (pH 7.4) containing 2 mM MgCl2 and stored at −80° C. Cell samples were incubated in the dark at 37° C. for 1 h in a reaction mix containing PBS/MgCl2, 20 μM hemin (Frontier Scientific, Newark, Del.) as a heme oxygenase substrate, rat liver cytosol as a source of biliverdin reductase, 2 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 0.5 U/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 0.8 mM NADPH. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml pure chloroform and a solution containing only bilirubin was extracted by vortex-centrifugation cycles. Absorbance values corresponding to the formation of bilirubin were obtained using an Ultraspec™ 500 pro visible spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and the data presented as pmoles bilirubin/mg protein/h. Protein concentrations were measured using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific).
The results are presented in FIG. 2A .
The results show that compound A improves significantly HO-1 activity at a concentration as low as 5 μM.
Example 3.1b: Assessment of Heme Oxygenase Activity with Compound C
Heme oxygenase activity of compound C was determined as described above and was compared to comparative compound CORM-401 and to comparative fumarate derivative (compound J:
The results are presented in FIG. 2B .
These results show that compound C significantly improves HO-1 activity at a concentration as low as 1 μM. Furthermore, compound C exhibits an improved HO-1 activity compared to comparative compound J, which is a fumarate derivative not comprising any CORM. This thus demonstrates that the combination of a fumarate moiety and a CO-releasing molecule (CORM) has a synergistic action on Heme oxygenase activity.
Example 3.2: Effect of Compound a, Compound B and Compound C on Inflammation
Determination of Nitrite Production
Nitrite production, an index of inflammation, was measured in BV2 cells challenged for 24 h with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of compound A or compound B. At the end of the incubation, nitrite levels were measured using the Griess method.12,14 Briefly, cell plates were centrifuged at 10,000×g for 5 min and the cell-free supernatant was incubated with an equal volume of Griess reagent (2 mM N-(1-naphtyl)ethylenediamide, 30 mM sulfanilamide and 140 mM o-phosphoric acid) for 10 min at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 560 nm. Concentrations of nitrite (μM) were calculated from a standard curve of sodium nitrite.
The results are presented in FIG. 3 .
Compound A markedly decreased LPS-mediated nitrite accumulation, showing that the Co2(CO)6 group contributes to the reduction of nitrite levels. Surprisingly, compound B also decreased nitrite production in a concentration-dependent manner but was not as effective as compound A.
Compound C was also assessed for its capacity to reduce nitrite level in a comparative assay with a curcumin derivative according to WO 2012/076696 of the following formula:
The results are presented in FIG. 3C .
As evidenced by these results, compound C is significantly more active (by an almost 2-fold) than the curcumin derivative according to WO 2012/076696, since the same reduction of nitrite production is observed with 2.5 μM of compound C and 5 μM of the curcumin derivative.
Compound C was also assessed for its capacity to reduce nitrite level in a comparative assay with comparative compounds CORM-401 and comparative compound J described above.
The results are presented in FIG. 3D .  TABLE 1

 Nitrite levels were measured in cell following 24 hr incubation with 0.5 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ±5 μM of comparative compound dimethylfumarate comparative compund J or Compound A.
 All values (mean ± SEM) are shown as percentage of LPS alone.
 *p < 0.05 vs. LPS alone; †p < 0.05 vs. dimethylfumarate; ‡p < 0.05 vs. comparative compounds.
As evidenced by these results, compound C is significantly more active (by almost 5-fold) than the fumarate derivative (comparative compound J), since almost the same reduction of nitrite production is observed with 1 μM of compound C and 5 μM of the fumarate derivative J. Furthermore, comparative compound CORM-401 is not active.
Compound A was also compared to dimethylfumarate derivative (comparative compound J) in the nitrite production assay. As shown by table 1, compound A allows a significant decrease of the inflammation caused by LPS (63.3%), which is more than 3 fold the decrease induced by the same concentration of dimethylfumarate derivative (comparative compound J). These results thus demonstrate that the combination of a fumarate moiety with a CORM induces a great benefit in disease treatment, more particularly inflammation treatment.
A CORM derivative according to WO 2008/003953 of the following formula: (compound 364 of WO 2008/003953) was evaluated in a comparative nitrite production assay.
As shown in FIG. 3E , compound 364 of WO 2008/003953 was able to decrease the nitrite production for less than 50% at a concentration as high as 100 μM. Compound 364 of WO 2008/003953 is thus for a lot less active than compound A of the present invention, which decreases nitrite production by more than 60% at a concentration as low as 5 μM (Table 1).

Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 1× Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% v/v TWEEN 20 and 5% w/v non-fat dry milk and incubated overnight at 4° C. with the following primary antibody for Nrf2: clone C-20 rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, Cell Signaling Technology or donkey anti-goat, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were detected with chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce ECL®, Thermo Scientific or RevelBIOt® Intense, Ozyme) and images captured using a G:Box F3 Imagery Station and GeneSys Software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK).
The results are presented in FIG. 5A-C .
Exposure of BV2 microglia cells to 20 μM of compound A for 2 h strongly promoted the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus. In addition, after 6 h of treatment, compound A induced a concentration-dependent increase in HO-1 protein expression. Compound B was less effective both as an Nrf2 activator and HO-1 inducing agent.
These experiments demonstrate that compound A, compound B and compound C are potent activators of HO-1 and inducers of HO-1 protein expression via the Nrf2/HO-1 axis at concentrations well below the toxic concentration range.
Moreover, comparison of compound C activity with comparative compounds CORM-401 and J shows that, at identical concentrations (5 μm), compound C is more potent than fumarate derivative (comparative compound J) and comparative compound CORM-401 at Nrf2 and HO-1 activation ( FIG. 5C ).
Induction of Nrf2 and HO-1 by Compound C in Keratinocyte Cells
Exposure of keratynocyte cells to 5 μM of compound C over time strongly promoted the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus and the HO-1 protein expression ( FIG. 5D ).
These experiments demonstrate that compound C is, in keratinocyte cells, a potent activator of HO-1 via the Nrf2/HO-1 axis at concentrations well below the toxic concentration range. Hence, it can be used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, more particularly skin inflammation such as wound healing or psoriasis.
Induction of Nrf2 and HO-1 by Compound C in THP-1
As for keratinocyte cells and BV2 microglia cells, exposure of THP-1 cells to compound C for 6 hours strongly promoted the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus and the HO-1 protein expression ( FIG. 5E ). Furthermore, when compared with HO-1 activation with comparative compound J, compound C induced a concentration-dependent increase in HO-1 protein expression starting from 5 μM of compound C, whereas 10 fold this concentration is needed to observe the same results with comparative compound J.
These experiments demonstrate that compound C is a potent activator of HO-1 via the Nrf2/HO-1 axis also in THP-1 cells.
Hence, it has been demonstrated that the compounds of the invention can be used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
Induction of Nrf2 and HO-1 by Compounds A, B and C in THP-1
THP-1 cells were exposed to different concentration of compounds A, B, and C during 6 hours. As shown above with BV2 microglial cells, compounds A and C induced a concentration-dependent increase in HO-1 protein expression and an Nrf2 activation, whereas compound B was less effective both as an Nrf-2 activator and HO-1 inducing agent ( FIG. 5F ).
These experiments demonstrate that the compounds of the invention comprising only one CORM group (also referred to as mono-CORM, i.e. compounds of formula (I) wherein R1 represents -Q′-Y) such as compound A and compound C, are potent activators of Nrf2 and inducers of HO-1 protein expression.
Example 4: Assessment of Compound of the Invention on TNF-α Production in Human Macrophages Challenged with LPS
Human THP-1 cells (ATCC; #TIB-202) were maintained at 37° C. and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 GlutaMax (Gibco, France) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (5×105/well/ml) and treated with phorbol myristate acetate [PMA (50 ng/ml)] for 24 h to induce macrophage differentiation. Human macrophages were then washed with PBS, incubated with medium and treated with LPS alone or with LPS in the presence of the various compounds for 24 h. Culture media was collected after 24 h and stored at −20° C. ELISA assay for TNF-α was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD OptEIA Set). Briefly, the plates (F96 maxisorp-Nunc-immuno, Thermofischer) were coated with the capture antibody overnight. Then, the plates were washed with PBS/tween 0.05% and saturated for 1 h with PBS/FBS 10% at 3TC. After several washings, standards and samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Later on, detection antibody and streptavidine-HRP were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. At the end, the substrate (TMB) was added leading to a blue color. The reaction was stopped with sulfuric acid leading to a yellow color. The plates were read at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Results were expressed in picograms per ml.
As shown in FIG. 7 , exposure of human macrophages to LPS for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in TNF-alpha production, a marker of inflammation. This effect was significantly decreased when macrophages were co-treated with increasing concentrations (1-10 μM) of compound C, D or E. Compound D appeared to be the most effective of the three compounds tested.
Example 5: Assessment of Compound of the Invention on TNF-α Production in THP-1 Cells Challenged with LPS
Human THP-1 cells cultured as in Example 3.3 were treated with LPS (100 μg/ml) alone or in the presence of 5 μM compound C, compound E or the comparative dimethyl fumarate (DMF) for 24 h. As shown in FIG. 8 , both compound C and compound E significantly reduced TNF-α production whereas dimethyl fumarate (DMF) did not have any effect.
