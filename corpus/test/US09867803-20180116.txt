FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The field of the invention includes IRE-1α inhibitors and their therapeutic uses.
BACKGROUND
Protein folding stress in the endoplasmic reticulum of a cell initiates a signal transduction cascade termed the unfolded protein response or UPR. A key enzyme, inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1α), relieves protein folding stress by enhancing molecular chaperone activity and therefore protects cells from stress induced apoptosis. Inhibitors of IRE-1α are useful for treating at least B cell autoimmune diseases, certain cancers, and some viral infections.

IRE-1α Inhibitor Compounds
IRE-1α inhibitor compounds directly inhibit IRE-1α. The compounds are understood to act through inhibition of the RNAse activity of the enzyme. In some embodiments IRE-1α inhibitor compounds form a complex with IRE-1α. In particular embodiments this activity is detected as cleavage of a human mini-XBP-1 mRNA stem-loop substrate 5′-CAGUCCGCAGGACUG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:1) by IRE-1α in vitro by 10 to 100%. Other substrates also can be used to detect cleavage. See US 2007/0105123.
IRE-1α inhibitor compounds can meet either or both of the following criteria:
a. Some compounds inhibit IRE-1α in the in vitro assay with an IC50 of approximately 0.0005-20 μM. Some of these compounds have an IC50 in this assay of approximately 1-20 μM. Others have an IC50 in this assay of approximately 0.1-1 μM. Still others have an IC50 of approximately 0.0005-0.1 μm.
b. Some compounds inhibit IRE-1α in an in vivo XBP-1 splicing assay (e.g., in myeloma cells) with an EC50 in the range of approximately 0.05-80 μM. Some of these compounds have an EC050 in this assay of approximately 10-80 μM. Others have an EC050 in this assay of approximately 1-10 μM. Still others have an EC050 in this assay of approximately 0.05-1 μM.

IRE-1α inhibitor compounds include both the free forms and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of pharmaceutically usable stereoisomers, E/Z isomers, enantiomers, racemates, diastereomers, hydrates, and solvates. Some of the specific IRE-1α inhibitor compounds described herein are the protonated salts of amine compounds. The term “free form” refers to the amine compounds in non-salt form. The encompassed pharmaceutically acceptable salts not only include the salts described for the specific compounds disclosed herein, but also all the typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the free form of IRE-1α inhibitor compounds and prodrugs thereof.
The free form of the specific salt compounds described may be isolated using techniques known in the art. For example, the free form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free forms may differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid and base salts are otherwise pharmaceutically equivalent to their respective free forms.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the disclosed IRE-1α inhibitor compounds can be synthesized which contain a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, the salts of the basic compounds are prepared either by ion exchange chromatography or by reacting the free base with stoichiometric amounts or with an excess of the desired salt-forming inorganic or organic acid in a suitable solvent or various combinations of solvents. Similarly, the salts of the acidic compounds are formed by reactions with the appropriate inorganic or organic base.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of IRE-1α inhibitor compounds include the conventional non-toxic salts of the compounds as formed by reacting a basic compound with an inorganic or organic acid. For example, conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like, as well as salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxy-benzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, trifluoroacetic and the like.
When an IRE-1α inhibitor compound is acidic, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include salts prepared form pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Particular salts are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N1-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. The preparation of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts described above and other typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts is more fully described by Berg et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts,” J. Pharm. Sci., 1977:66:1-19.
Some IRE-1α compounds or prodrugs are potentially internal salts or zwitterions, because under physiological conditions a deprotonated acidic moiety in the compound, such as a carboxyl group, may be anionic, and this electronic charge might then be balanced off internally against the cationic charge of a protonated or alkylated basic moiety, such as a quaternary nitrogen atom.
IRE-1α inhibitor compounds or prodrugs thereof may have asymmetric centers, chiral axes, and chiral planes (as described in: E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen, Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1994, pages 1119-1190), and may occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, and as individual diastereomers, with all possible isomers and mixtures thereof, including optical isomers, being included.
An IRE-1α inhibitor compound or prodrug thereof may be of such a nature that its constituent atoms are capable of being arranged spatially in two or more ways, despite having identical bonds. As a consequence, this compound exists in the form of stereoisomers. Cis/trans isomerism is only one type of stereoisomerism. If the stereoisomers are image and mirror image which cannot be superimposed, they are enantiomers which have chirality or handedness since one or more asymmetric carbon atoms are present in the structure forming them. Enantiomers are optically active and therefore distinguishable since they rotate the plane of polarized light to an equal extent, but in opposite directions.
“Solvates” are adductions of inert solvent molecules onto the compounds which form owing to their mutual attractive force. Solvates are, for example, monohydrates, dihydrates or alcoholates.
If two or more asymmetric carbon atoms are present in an IRE-1α compound, two possible configurations exist at each of these carbon atoms. If two asymmetric carbon atoms are present, four possible stereoisomers exist, for example. Furthermore, these four possible stereoisomers can be divided into six possible pairs of stereoisomers that differ from each other. In order for a pair of molecules with more than one asymmetric carbon to be enantiomers, they must have different configurations at each asymmetric carbon. Those pairs that do not behave as enantiomers have a different stereochemical relationship, which is known as a diastereomeric relationship. Stereoisomers that are not enantiomers are known as diastereoisomers, or, more frequently, diastereomers.
IRE-1α inhibitor compounds thus include stereoisomers, and, if these are enantiomers, the individual enantiomers, racemic mixtures of these enantiomers, and artificial, i.e. synthetic, mixtures comprising proportions of these enantiomers which are different from the proportions of these enantiomers observed in a racemic mixture. If an IRE-1α inhibitor compound has stereoisomers that are diastereomers, this compound includes the individual diastereomers as well as mixtures of any two or more of these diastereomers in any desired proportions.
The specific biological effects and/or physical and chemical properties of a pair or set of enantiomers of an IRE-1α inhibitor compound—if present—may make it desirable to use these enantiomers in certain ratios, for example to form a final therapeutic product. The following is intended to serve for illustration: if a pair of enantiomers exists, the enantiomers can be used in ratios such as 90% (R)-10% (S), 80% (R)-20% (S), 70% (R)-30% (S), 60% (R)-40% (S), 50% (R)-50% (S), 40% (R)-60% (S), 30% (R)-70% (S), 20% (R)-80% (S), and 10% (R)-90% (S). After evaluation of the properties of the various enantiomers of an IRE-1α inhibitor compound—if they exist—the corresponding amount of one or more of these enantiomers having certain desired properties which form the final therapeutic product can be determined in a simple manner.
For IRE-1α inhibitor compounds disclosed herein which may exist as tautomers, both tautomeric forms are encompassed by a depicted structural formula, even though only one tautomeric structure is depicted. For example, a compound such as that below drawn as the keto tautomer includes the enol tautomer, and vice versa, as well as mixtures thereof
Prodrugs
A “prodrug” as used herein is a compound that can be metabolized to active IRE-1α inhibitor compound after administration. For example, IRE-1α inhibitor compounds disclosed herein can be modified, e.g., with alkyl or acyl groups, sugars, or oligopeptides and which are rapidly cleaved in vivo to release the active IRE-1α inhibitor compounds.
Derivatives of the corresponding aromatic alcohols can serve as prodrugs for aromatic aldehydes because alcohols and aldehydes are metabolically interconvertible, according to the following general scheme: Scheline, 1972, Xenobiotica, 2, 227-36.
Examples of prodrugs of aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and other functional groups are described in Wermuth et al., 1996, Designing Prodrugs and Bioprecursors I: Carrier Prodrugs. In The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, pp. 672-696; and in Wermuth, 1996, “Preparation of Water-Soluble Compounds by Covalent Attachment of Solubilizing Moieties,” in Wermuth, ed., The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, pp. 756-776. Other general aldehyde derivatives and alcohol derivatives that can perform prodrug functions as well as methods for their preparation are described in Cheronis et al., 1965, Semimicro Qualitative Organic Analysis, New York: Interscience, pp. 465-518.
Methods of Preparing IRE-1α Inhibitor Compounds and Prodrugs
IRE-1α inhibitor compounds and starting materials for their synthesis can be prepared by appropriate modification of methods known in the art as described in the literature, for example in standard works such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart. Methods may also be found by computer search in The MDL® CrossFire Beilstein database, in which the reaction domain details the preparation of substances. See also the specific Examples, below.

Methods
IRE-1α inhibitor compounds or prodrugs thereof can be used to inhibit IRE-1α activity (e.g., cleavage of RNA or mRNA, RNA or mRNA splicing). In some embodiments IRE-1a activity (e.g., cleavage of RNA or mRNA, RNA or mRNA splicing) is inhibited in vitro. In other embodiments IRE-1α activity (e.g., cleavage of RNA or mRNA, RNA or mRNA splicing) is inhibited in vivo.
IRE-1α inhibitor compounds or prodrugs thereof can be used to prepare formulations or medicaments for inhibiting tumor cell growth and for treating the disorders disclosed below. IRE-1α inhibitor compounds or prodrugs thereof can be administered to a patient, preferably a human patient, in pharmaceutical preparations as disclosed above, preferably with a pyrogen-free pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, at doses effective to treat or ameliorate a symptom of a disorder associated with the unfolded protein response. IRE-1α inhibitor compounds and prodrugs thereof can be used to treat patient populations which are not entirely coincident with those most commonly receiving treatment for disorders associated with the unfolded protein response (e.g., cancer therapies or therapies for autoimmune disorders). For example, IRE-1α inhibitor compounds and prodrugs thereof can be administered to patients at the earliest stages of these conditions, even those to whom traditional therapies are commonly not offered.
Disorders Associated with UPR
A fine balance exists between a cell's life and death depending on how protein folding stress is managed by the cell (proteostasis). Imbalances in proteostasis lead to many metabolic, oncological, neurodegenerative, inflammatory, cardiovascular disorders and infectious disease (Balch et al., Science 319, 916, 2008). The UPR relates specifically to the proteostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum where all secreted and membrane proteins are translated, folded and processed for delivery to their individual site of action. Therefore, activation of the UPR enhances protein folding in the ER allowing the cell to survive. If protein folding stress is not managed in the ER, the cells will initiate apoptosis.
Protein folding stress may be a natural hallmark of the type of cell for example insulin secreting β-islet cells or antibody secreting plasma cells. In both cases, the cell has fine tuned the machinery to deal with the stress by activating the UPR. Depending on the disease type, it may be therapeutically beneficial to induce or inhibit the UPR. For example, in type II diabetes or Alzheimer's disease, it may be therapeutically beneficial to activate the UPR in such a way where β-islet cells survive the stress of over producing insulin or neurons survive the apoptotic effects due to unfolded aggregates of β-amyloid protein. Diseases such as cancer, inflammation, and viral infection may be therapeutically modulated by inhibition of the UPR. In these types of conditions, cellular survival due to corruption of the UPR may be impacted. Protein folding in the ER is negatively impacted by such conditions in the tumor microenvironment as hypoxia, glucose starvation, amino acid deprivation, acidosis and mutant malfolded and oncogenic proteins. Additionally chemo-, bio-, and radiotherapy can lead to protein folding stress. It may be possible to induce apoptosis in these conditions by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic effects of the UPR. Myeloma derived from neoplastic antibody secreting plasma cells provides an example of a condition in which this approach can be applied.
Lastly, enveloped viruses must use and corrupt this system to ensure production of progeny from infected cells. Viruses often produce vast quantities of viral membrane glycoproteins which are folded and modified in the ER. Therefore, activation of the UPR by the virus for this purpose as a survival mechanism is entirely conceivable. It is therefore logical that inhibition of the UPR during viral infection can impact the outcome of the disease in a beneficial way.
Only specialized secretory cells and diseased cells activate the UPR for their own benefit. Most cells are not under such protein folding stress and therefore would not be impacted by a UPR inhibitor. Thus, “disorders associated with the UPR” as used herein means conditions for which pathogenesis can be advantageously impacted by inhibition of the UPR. In various embodiments such inhibition of the UPR is accomplished through inhibition of IRE-1α.
In some embodiments the IRE-1α inhibitor compounds or prodrugs thereof are useful to treat or ameliorate a symptom of a B cell autoimmune disease, certain cancers, and infections of enveloped viruses that use the endoplasmic reticulum as a viral factory for expressing viral surface and spike proteins for budding and infection. IRE-1α inhibitors and prodrugs thereof can be used as single agents or in combination therapies, as described below.

Cancers which can be treated include solid tumors, such as tumors of the breast, bone, prostate, lung, adrenal gland (e.g., adrenocortical tumors), bile duct, bladder, bronchus, nervous tissue (including neuronal and glial tumors), gall bladder, stomach, salivary gland, esophagus, small intestine, cervix, colon, rectum, liver, ovary, pancreas, pituitary adenomas, and secretory adenomas. Methods are particularly useful for treating drug- or radiation-resistant solid tumors.
Cancers of the blood (e.g., lymphomas and leukemias) also can be treated including, but not limited to, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (e.g., cutaneous T cell lymphomas such as Sezary syndrome and Mycosis fungoides, diffuse large cell lymphoma, HTLV-1 associated T cell lymphoma, nodal peripheral T cell lymphoma, extranodal peripheral T cell lymphoma, central nervous system lymphoma, and AIDS-related lymphoma). Leukemias include acute and chronic types of both lymphocytic and myelogenous leukemia (e.g, acute lymphocytic or lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, T cell prolymphocytic leukemia, adult T cell leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia). Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), the precursor of myeloma, also can be treated.
Viral infections which can be treated include infections of enveloped viruses which use the unfolded protein response pathway when they replicate and form infectious progeny (e.g., measles, pox viruses, Ebola, etc.). Infections also include those of Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Flaviviruses (e.g., Japanese Encephalitis Virus and West Nile Virus), and Hepatitis C virus (HCV).
Combination Therapies
Various types of physiological stress induce the unfolded protein response including, but not limited to, hypoxia, nutrient starvation, acidosis, and genetic damage resulting in mutant or over-expressed misfolded proteins (oncogenic stress). One or more of these conditions are manifest in cancer cells, which may in part be mediated by the microenviroment of the tumor. It is likely the cytoprotective arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) plays an anti-apoptotic role in tumor survival. In addition, bio- and chemotherapeutic drugs and thermal and radiation treatments may further impact the protein folding and degradation cycle in the ER thereby inducing the UPR as a protective resistance mechanism. Patients succumb to cancer because either the tumor is resistant to conventional therapies, or returns in a resistant form after an initial response to treatment and, therefore, new treatments and treatment combinations are needed.
Angiogenesis inhibitors block tumor growth by inhibiting new blood vessel formation, a process that would enhance the stress effects of the tumor microenvironment. A promising approach to further reduce tumor burden would be to administer anti-angiogenesis agents in combination with IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitors to obtain a similar effect as that demonstrated by RNAi knockdown of GRP78, the major chaperone of the ER and target of XBP-1s (Dong et al., Cancer Res. 2007 Jul. 15; 67(2):6700-7). In addition, IRE-1α itself regulates angiogensis by influencing the expression of VEGF.
In some embodiments an IRE-1α inhibitor compound or prodrug thereof is administered in combination with a therapeutic agent that induces or up-regulates IRE-1α expression (e.g., Hsp90 and or HDAC inhibitors, both of which induce IRE-1α activation and XBP-1 splicing) or a therapeutic agent which is less effective when IRE-1α is expressed (e.g., 17-AAG (TANESPIMYCIN® and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)).
In some embodiments an IRE-1α inhibitor compound or prodrug thereof is administered in combination with one or more cancer therapies. These therapies include treatments such as radiation therapy or thermal treatment (heat shock) as well as administration of therapeutic agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents and biotherapeutic agents, as described below. Such therapies can be administered separately or together with the IRE-1a inhibitor compound or prodrug, e.g., the one or more treatments can independently be administered at essentially the same time as the IRE-1α inhibitor compound or prodrug or can be administered either before or after the IRE-1α inhibitor compound.

Inhibition of IRE-1α Dependent Decay of Membrane Associated mRNAs (RIDD) Pathway Using IRE-1α Inhibitors
Inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1α) is the most highly conserved signaling node of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and represents a potential therapeutic target for a number of diseases associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. IRE-1α activates the XBP-1 transcription factor by site specific cleavage of two hairpin loops within its mRNA promoting its nonconventional splicing and alternative translation. In addition, the endoribonuclease of IRE-1α is required for the cleavage and degradation of certain mRNAs coding for primarily secreted and transmembrane proteins targeted to the ER called IRE-1α dependent mRNA decay (RIDD). However, it had not been known whether this is a direct activity or the subsequent activation of a second endoribonuclease. Using IRE-1α specific endoribonuclease inhibitors, Examples 43-46 below demonstrate that this activity is likely direct from the IRE-1α endoribonuclease and that inhibitors selectivity block down-regulation of known targets of the RIDD pathway including but not limited to CD59 and Blos1. IRE-1α inhibitors therefore be useful to treat or ameliorate a symptom of a neurological disorder, or disorders that involve overproduction of insulin or inflammation.
Protein folding perturbations resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of diseases as diverse as neurodegeneration, diabetes and cancer. The unfolded protein response (UPR) coordinates the ability of a cell to respond to ER stress by altering protein translation, folding, and post translational modification of all secreted and membrane proteins. Terminally unfolded proteins are retro-transported to the cytosol by the ER associated degradation (ERAD) machinery for proteolysis by the proteasome. The ER is also the site of lipid biosynthesis and membrane expansion. These activities are linked physiologically to specialized secretory cells; however, depending on stress levels, the UPR can control cellular survival or death via autophagy and apoptosis (Ron & Walter, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 8(7), 519-29, 2007). Secretion and membrane composition are balanced by the high caloric demand of these activities against the energy homeostasis of the cell (Ron & Walter, 2007).
Inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1α) is the most highly conserved signaling node of the unfolded protein response (Ron & Walter, 2007). A unique ER resident transmembrane kinase with a novel C-terminal endoribonuclease domain, IRE-1α is activated in part by the disassociation of BiP/GRP78 in the presence of unfolded protein in the ER lumen (Ron & Walter, 2007). The signal is transduced to the cytosol by the sequential dimerization/multimerization, trans-autophosphorylation and activation of its endoribonuclease (Tirasophon et al., Genes Dev. 14 (21) 2725-36, 2000). The specific activity of the endoribonuclease is responsible for the unconventional cytosolic splicing of HAC1 in yeast and excision of the 26 nucleotide intron of the X-box binding protein (XBP-1) transcription factor in metazoan organisms (Ron & Walter, 2007). In mammalian cells IRE-1α acts in concert with companion UPR signaling molecules PKR-like ER resident kinase (PERK) and ATF6 (Ron & Walter, 2007).
XBP-1 mRNA, a major substrate of the IRE-1α endoribonuclease, is cleaved specifically at two conserved stem-loop sites. Each site is located 3′ to a mirrored guanosine residue in the 7 base loop (Ron & Walter, 2007). The resulting internal fragment, a 26-nt intron, is removed and the two exon ends are ligated by and unknown mechanism in mammalian cells and by tRNA ligase in yeast (Ron & Walter, 2007). The rejoined mRNA shifts the Open Reading Frame (ORF) and extends the C-terminal domain of XBP-1 from amino acid 164 with an alternative 212 amino acid reading frame producing the active “spliced” transcription factor, XBP-1s, which regulates a broad range of ER resident chaperones, ER translocon channels, ERAD components and lipid metabolic enzymes (Ron & Walter, 2007). An emerging and important activity of IRE-1α is regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD) of mRNAs encoding ER targeted membrane and secreted proteins during stress analogous to the less discriminate but targeted activities of IRE-1α's evolutionary homologue, RNase L (Hollien & Weissman, Science 313(5783) 104-07, 2006). This activity in combination with XBP-1s expression has the potential to alter the surface composition of stressed cells and the extracellular proteome. In addition, it appears to selectively target different mRNAs in different types of cells. Substrates include but are not limited to insulin (Han et al., Cell 138(3) 562-75, 2009), CD59 (Oikawa et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 360(1) 122-127, 2007), Blos1 (Hollien et al., J Cell Biol. 186(3) 323-31, 2009), DGAT2 (Thorpe & Schwarze, Cell Stress Chaperones. 15(5) 497-508, 2010) and IRE-1α's own mRNA (Tirasophon et al., 2000). IRE-1α endoribonuclease inhibitors selectively block mRNA degradation by IRE-1α including Blos1, DGAT2 and CD59 and IRE-1α itself.
Example 43 below demonstrates that selective and potent IRE-1α endoribonuclease inhibitors disclosed herein can block the RIDD of mRNA targets in both unstressed and ER stressed RPMI 8226 myeloma cells. Diseases linked to ER stress include neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, inflammation and cancer. This has important implications for disease management.
For example, CD59 is a GPI linked cell surface glycoprotein which as member of the complement regulatory factor family which includes CD46 and CD55. Compliment regulatory factors inhibit complement mediated lysis of cells by preventing membrane attack complex formation. Down modulation of CD59 may play a role in many diseases with an immune component, such as Barraquer-Simons Syndrome, asthma, lupus erythematous, glomerulonephritis, various forms of arthritis, autoimmune heart disease, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and ischemia-reperfusion injuries, autoimmune hemocytopenias and rejection of transplanted organs (Song, Autoimmunity 39(5) 403-10, 2006; Ruiz-Argüelles & Llorente, Autoimmun Rev. 6(3):155-61, 2007; Arumugam et al., Shock 21(5) 401-06, 2004; Asgari et al., Curr Opin Organ Transplant 15(4):486-91, 2010).
Blos1 is a component of endosome-localized Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex-1 (BLOC-1). Alteration of components of this complex are associated with schizophrenia. It is conceivable that down modulation of Blos1 (BLOC1S1) due to IRE-1α activation by ER stress may impact normal synaptic transmission (Ryder & Faundez, Sci Signal. 2(93): 66, 2009).
IRE-1α inhibitors disclosed herein (or prodrugs or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of IRE-1α inhibitors) can be used to block degradation of Blos1 mRNA, DGAT2 mRNA, CD59 mRNA, and IRE-1α mRNA. In some embodiments, a cell comprising an mRNA selected from the group consisting of Blos1 mRNA, DGAT2 mRNA, CD59 mRNA, and IRE-1α mRNA is contacted with an IRE-1α inhibitor or a prodrug or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an IRE-1α inhibitor. In some embodiments, the cell is in vitro. In other embodiments, the cell is in vivo.
In some embodiments, an IRE-1α inhibitor or a prodrug or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an IRE-1α inhibitor is administered to treat Barraquer-Simons Syndrome, asthma, lupus erythematous, glomerulonephritis, various forms of arthritis, autoimmune heart disease, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and ischemia-reperfusion injuries, autoimmune hemocytopenias and rejection of transplanted organs.
In some embodiments, an IRE-1α inhibitor or a prodrug or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an IRE-1α inhibitor is administered to treat schizophrenia.
Routes of Administration
Pharmaceutical preparations constituting embodiments can be administered locally or systemically. Suitable routes of administration include oral, pulmonary, rectal, transmucosal, intestinal, parenteral (including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary routes), intranodal, intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, intraocular, transdermal, topical, and vaginal routes. As described in more detail above, dosage forms include, but are not limited to, tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, suppositories, solutions, capsules, creams, patches, minipumps and the like. Targeted delivery systems also can be used (for example, a liposome coated with target-specific antibody).
Dosage
A pharmaceutical composition embodiment comprises at least one active ingredient (an IRE-1α inhibitor compound or prodrug thereof) in a therapeutically effective dose. A “therapeutically effective dose” is the amount of an IRE-1α inhibitor compound or prodrug thereof which, when administered to a patient over a treatment period, results in a measurable improvement in survival time and/or quality of life. Such improvements include, for example, a delay or halt in the progression of a cancer, partial or complete regression, reduced severity of one or more existing symptoms, delay or prevention of the development of one or more symptoms, and one or more improved laboratory values (including, but not limited to, a biological marker e.g., XBP-1 splicing and down stream targets such as EDEM, VEGF-A, ERdj4). Various methods and assays can be used to assess whether and to what extent an improvement occurs.
Determination of therapeutically effective doses is well within the capability of those skilled in the art. A therapeutically effective dose initially can be estimated from in vitro enzyme assays, cell culture assays, and/or animal models. For example, a dose can be formulated in an animal model to achieve a circulating concentration range at least as concentrated as the IC50 as determined in an in vitro enzyme assay or in a cell culture (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of IRE-1α activity). Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. See the FDA guidance document “Guidance for Industry and Reviewers Estimating the Safe Starting Dose in Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers” (HFA-305), which provides an equation for use in calculating a human equivalent dose (HED) based on in vivo animal studies.
Appropriate animal models for the relevant diseases are known in the art.

LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures and/or experimental animals. Data obtained from cell culture assays or animal studies can be used to determine initial human doses. As is known in the art, the dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form and route of administration used.
Usual dosages for systemic administration to a human patient range from 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg (e.g., 1-10 μg/kg, 20-80 μg/kg, 5-50 μg/kg, 75-150 μg/kg, 100-500 μg/kg, 250-750 μg/kg, 500-1000 μg/kg, 1-10 mg/kg, 5-50 mg/kg, 25-75 mg/kg, 50-100 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg). In some embodiments, the treatment schedule can require that a plasma concentration of an IRE-1α inhibitor compound be maintained for a period of time (e.g., several days or a week) and then allowed to decay by ceasing administration for a period of time (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks). The amount of composition administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the disorder, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician.
The following specific examples are provided for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the subject matter described above.

IRE-1α Assay
A fusion protein comprising glutathione S transferase (GST) and human IRE-1α (GST-IRE-1α) obtained from a 500 ml baculovirus-infected insect cell culture can be used to measure IRE-1α activity in vitro.
Five μl of a reaction mixture comprising 1× reaction buffer (5× reaction buffer is 100 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 250 mM KOAc, 2.5 mM MgCl2), 3 mM DTT, and 0.4% polyethylene glycol water is added to each well of 384 well plates. Twenty-five nanoliters of a 1 mM test compound solution are added to test wells. Three μl of a 128 ng/ml IRE-1α preparation are added to each test well and to positive control wells (final concentration 5.82 ng/well). Negative control wells contain only reaction mixture and test compound.
After spinning the plates at 1200 rpm for 30 seconds, 3 μl of an IRE-1α human mini-XBP-1 mRNA stem-loop substrate 5′-CAGUCCGCAGCACUG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:1), labeled with the fluorescent dye Cy5 at the 5′ end and Black Hole Quencher 2 (BH2) at the 3′ end, are added to each well of a control plate. The plates are again spun at 1200 rpm for 30 seconds. Final concentrations for the assay are: 63 nM IRE-1α substrate, 5.82 ng IRE-1α protein, and 2.5 μM test compound.
The plates are covered with lids and incubated for one hour at 30° C. The plates are then transferred to an ACQUEST™ microplate reader. Data is analyzed using data analysis software, and the percent activity of IRE-1α is calculated.
Example 36
Determination of IC50 for Inhibition of IRE-1α
IC50 for inhibition of IRE-1α of compounds identified in Table 1 was measured as described in EXAMPLE 35.
Example 37
Kinase Selectivity Assays
Compounds are assayed for their ability to inhibit 86 different kinases at a concentration of 10 μM. The results of the assays demonstrate that these compounds are selective for IRE-1α.
Example 38
Cell-Based Assays
Human myeloma MM.1s cells are incubated with a compound for 1.25 hours before stressing the cells with 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). After an additional 45 minutes (2 hours total) with compound and DTT, the cells are harvested with TRIZOL® (a mono-phasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate), and total RNA is prepared as directed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Human XBP-1 is amplified by RT-PCR with the following primers, which flank the 26 base unconventional intron excised by IRE-1α:
CCTGGTTGCTGAAGAGGAGG (SEQ ID NO:2) (forward) and
CCATGGGGAGATGTTCTGGAG (SEQ ID NO:3) (reverse).
In unstressed cells, IRE-1α is inactive and hence, the 26 base intron is left in the XBP-1 mRNA. RT-PCR of unstressed (U) cells then generates the upper band. When cells are stressed (S) with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressing agent DTT, IRE-1α is activated due to accumulating unfolded protein and the resulting RT-PCR product is 26 base pairs shorter. Increasing amounts of the compound block IRE-1α-mediated XBP-1 splicing as demonstrated by a shift from a lower band to an upper band. Compound potency reflects SAR in the in vitro enzyme assay.
Determination of Cellular EC50 for IRE-1α Inhibitors
Compounds which pass specificity assays are assayed for cellular EC50 using endogenous XBP-1 splicing in myeloma cells. XBP-1 is regulated through the excision of a 26 nucleotide intron from the XBP-1 mRNA by the highly specific endoribonuclease activity of IRE-1α. This splicing event induces a frame shift in the ORF of the C-terminus of XBP-1 leading to the translation of the larger 54 kD active transcription factor rather than the inactive 33 kD form. This splicing event is used to measure IRE-1α activity on XBP-1 mRNA in cells and tissues.
Briefly, compounds are incubated in the presence or absence of an ER stress agent (e.g., DTT), and the ratio of XBP-1u (unspliced) to XBP-1s (spliced) is quantified by RT-PCR. The ED50 is determined as the 50% XBP-1s to total XPB-1 levels. Compounds which have EC50s equal to or below 10 μM are used in standard apoptosis assays, including Annexin V staining and CASPASE-GLO®.
Proliferation assays using myeloma cell lines (U266, RPMI8226 and MM.1s) are used to determine ED50. Compounds are used as single agents and in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs. IRE-1α inhibitor compounds inhibit the proliferation of RPMI8226 myeloma cells, which have endogenous activation of the pathway and are further induced by the addition of bortezomib. When an IRE-1α inhibitor compound is used in combination with MG-132, increased apoptosis is observed with U266 myeloma cells.
Example 39
Animal Model/Preclinical Validation Studies
The preclinical validation strategy employs a set of animal models representing normal tissues under chemical stress and multiple myeloma xenographs. The normal animal model is employed as a surrogate model where dose-related on-target activity of compounds can be confirmed in tissues sensitive to standard UPR inducing agents such as tunicamycin (Wu et al., Dev Cell. 2007 September; 13(1d):351-64). Normal mouse tissues are not under ER stress, and therefore the XBP-1 mRNA remains as the inactive, unspliced form. Upon induction with tunicamycin, tissues induce active XBP-1 mRNA splicing, and this activity is suppressed by IRE-1α inhibitors. This on-target ER stress animal model is a useful screening and early pharmacokinetic tool.
Antibody production is evaluated in a second surrogate model. However, in cell-based models, IRE-1α inhibitors have been shown to potently inhibit antibody production.
Final efficacy studies are performed in myeloma xenograft models, as described below.
Example 40
RPMI8226 Xenograft Efficacy Model
SCID mice are evaluated for their ability to support implantation of desired tumor cells in support of model development and characterization. Mice are injected intravenously (5) or implanted either subcutaneously (SC) or intraperitoneally (IP). To generate a relevant animal model mimicking human disease, it is desirable that all three approaches are evaluated for improved implantation rates and relevant disease progression, as is well known in the art. SC injections provide an easy way to measure tumor growth and efficacy, and IV and IP injections represent a more physiologically relevant model of human tumor spread. SC injections are given primarily in the flank, while IV injections are administered in the tail vein. Mice are manually restrained for SC and IP injections, and a Broome mouse restrainer is used for IV injections.
Example 41
Evaluation of IRE-1α Inhibitor Compounds in a Xenograft Efficacy Model
SCID mice are implanted with tumor cells (human RPMI8226 myeloma cells) via IP, IV or SC routes based on the results from the xenograft model development studies (above). Mice are treated with compound or mock treated (vehicle) for a period of up to 4-5 weeks. Compound administration can be via IV, IP, PO or SC routes. In some cases, tunicamycin is administered via IP injection in order to stimulate stress in the animal. This stress mimics the stress an animal may undergo during times of tumor growth. The tunicaymycin injection mimics tumor growth during times of stress and permits evaluation of biomarkers which indicate the effectiveness of a compound (such as XBP-1 splicing) by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, or Western blots.
Mice are monitored for tumor growth, regression and general health. Tumors are collected and characterized by immunohistochemistry and/or FACS analysis. Tumor growth is measured by calipers, ultrasound, or by abdominal lavage. Biomarkers in the blood or tumor can evaluated (primarily XBP-1 splicing).
In some experiments, blood samples are collected at various time points during the dosing (i.e., day 1 or week 4 etc.) to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile. The time points of blood collection vary depending on the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug being tested. The volume of blood sample is 100 microliters/per time point, and mice are bled twice after drug administration within a 24 hour period via retro-orbital sinus. If the same mouse is used, blood samples are collected once from each eye during 24 hours.
Tumor cells are cultured and injected IP, IV (tail vein) or SC (flank) in the mouse using a 21G needle in a volume of approx 100 μL. Mice are treated with compounds or vehicle alone as a control by IV, IP, SC or PO routes 5 days per week for up to 4-5 weeks. Blood is collected via retroorbital bleed (100 μl) at 2 time points (different eyes). The endpoint of the study depends on the overall health of the mice: while mice are euthanized at the end of 4-5 weeks in most studies, mice are maintained until day 40 in a few studies if their general health will allow. The reason for maintaining studies for 40 days is to determine if the tested compounds have a long term effect on inhibiting tumor growth. Euthanization of mice in which tumor regression is observed will depend on the experimental design. In screening mode, the experiment will end with tumors in the control/untreated group reach 1.5 cm, are ulcerated or when loss of motility is observed in that group. In follow up experiments, mice in which tumor regression is observed may be maintained longer, until they show signs of tumor growth of ill health.
Therapeutic dosing with bortezomib 0.75 mg/kg IV twice weekly of SCID mice bearing human myeloma RPMI8226 tumor xenografts resulted in suppression of tumor growth. However, after cessation of bortezomib therapy, tumors often recurred and grew into large masses. Therefore, mice will be treated in combination as with both bortezomib (as indicated) and twice daily with 10-60 mg/kg IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitors such as compound 17-1 by oral, IP or IV administration. Compounds which reduce the incidence of tumor recurrence are identified.

Combination Therapies
The spliced form of XBP-1, as a homodimer and heterodimer with ATF-6, transcriptionally regulates genes involved in adapting to ER stress (Wu et al., Dev Cell. 2007 September; 13(1d):351-64). Many of these downstream targets are major chaperones, co-chaperones and ERAD components of the ER. Chaperones such as GRP78 and GRP94 are stable and long lived proteins with half lives on the order of days (Wu et al., Dev Cell. 2007 September; 13(1d):351-64). Therefore, treatment of cancer with an IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitor may require up to 5 to 6 days of treatment in each cycle.
In some embodiments, combination therapy given in cycles such as with proteasome inhibitors involves giving the patient 2 days of pretreatment with IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitor and then simultaneously with the chemotherapeutic agent until a pharmacodynamic effect is achieved (typically 24 hours post bortezomib infusion). Bortezomib is typically administered on three week cycles, every 1, 4, 8 and 11 days (of 21). Dosing is 1.3 mg/m2 by IV administration. IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitors can be administered 2 day prior and 24 hours post infusion of bortezomib at 10 to 100 mg/kg by the IV or oral route once, twice or three times daily depending on the PK/PD relationship.
A similar protocol can be employed with Hsp90 and or HDAC inhibitors. Alternatively, both agents are administered simultaneously for the duration of each cycle depending on the PK/PD relation of the inhibitor. IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitors can be given to breast cancer patients in combination with Tamoxifen (Gomez et al., FASEB J. 2007 December; 21(2):4013-27) or in combination with Sorafinib to various other cancers including kidney carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (Rahmani et al., Mol Cell Biol. 2007 August; 27(15):5499-513).
In general, because many kinase inhibitors often are not selective on their targeted kinase and often affect many additional kinases; they may cause non-specific cellular stress which may activate the UPR. Therefore, combination approaches may be useful using IRE-1α/XBP-1 inhibitors as sensitizing agents.

Inhibition of RIDD-Targeted Degradation
a. Experimental Procedures
Cell Culture.
RPMI 8226 cells were grown in monolayer culture using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37° C. and 5% CO2. Compounds were kept as 10 mM stock in DMSO at −20° C. and diluted in medium to 10 μM. Thapsigargin (Tg) was resuspended in DMSO and diluted in medium.
RT-qPCR.
Procedures for measuring XBP-1s and XBP-1u mRNAs have been described previously (Volkmann et al., J. Biol. Chem. 286, 12743-55, 2011). Briefly, total RNA was harvested from cells or tissue using TRIZOL® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's procedures. After ethanol precipitation and resuspension of the RNA, RIBOGREEN® (Invitrogen) was used to quantify the yield- and normalize the RNA concentration in the source tube containing isolated RNA. RT-PCR was performed by oligo dT priming, SUPERSCRIPT® II (Invitrogen) and reverse transcription using the AMPLITAQ GOLD® Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Primers for human XBP-1 were
5′-CCTGGTTGCTGAAGAGGAGG-3′ (forward, SEQ ID NO:2) and
5′-CCATGGGGAGATGTTCTGGAG-3′ (reverse, SEQ ID NO:3).
All DNA oligos were purchased from IDT DNA Technologies. PCR reactions were run on a Bio-Rad PTC-100® 96-well thermocycler; heating at 94° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 58° C. for 30 seconds polymerizing at 72° C. for 30 seconds for 35 cycles.
The same RNA preparations were used to evaluate levels of CD59 and Blos1 by RT-qPCR. CD59 primers were and the probe and primer sequences were
CD59 224s: CCAGTTGGTGTAGGAGTTGAGACC (SEQ ID NO:4);
CD59 354a: AGGCTATGACCTGAATGGCAGA (SEQ ID NO:5); and
CD59ap: CAGCCAGGACGAGCAGCAGCCCG (SEQ ID NO:6).
Blos1 probes were commercially available from Applied Biosciences (Hs00155241_m1).
b. Results
Low levels of IRE-1α activation where observed in unstressed human RPMI 8226 plasmacytoma cells as demonstrated small amounts of XBP-1s relative to XBP-1u ( FIG. 1 ). Treatment of RPMI cells for 2 hours with 300 nM Thapsigargin (Tg) induced near complete conversion of XBP-1u to XBP-1s and 10 uM compound inhibited this completely ( FIG. 1 ). When compound B was added in combination with Tg for the 2, 4, 6, 8, 16 and 24 hours, complete inhibition of XBP-1s with repopulation of XBP-1u was observed. RNA samples from this experiment were subjected RT-qPCR using specific primers for CD59 and Blos1. Inhibition of RIDD targeted degradation of Blos1 (Hollien, 2009) and CD59 (Oikawa, 2007) was observed by RT-qPCR. ( FIG. 2 ).

Measurement of XBP-1 Slicing Inhibition in the Livers and Kidneys of CB17 SCID Mice in Response to Tunicamycin and Subsequent Treatment with an IRE-1α Inhibitor
CB17 SCID mice were treated with 1 mg/kg tunicamycin by intraperitoneal (IP) injection at time 0 (T=0). Two hours later, compound A formulated in 10% hydroxy beta propyl cyclo dextran HBPCD was administered by IP injection. Doses were 50 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (4 mice in each group). Mice were sacrificed two hours later (4 hours from T=0), and the designated organs were harvested ( FIG. 3A ).
RT-PCR analysis was performed using murine-specific XBP-1 primers from total RNA harvested from specified organs. The results are shown in FIG. 4B . Tunicamycin alone induces XBP-1 spliced (XBP-1s) relative to PBS treated mice. Dose response for target inhibition (XBP-1s) can be observed with increasing doses of compound A administered IP in both the liver and kidney. Each lane represents an individual mouse where RNA was harvested and RT-PCR was performed. Method of RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis is described in Volkmann et al., J. Biol. Chem. 286, 12743-55, 2011.
The experiment was repeated using intravenous (IV) administration of compound A (50 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) and oral administration of compound A (100 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg). The results are shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B , respectively.

Chem. 286, 12743-55, 2011) and splicing was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Four tumors for each dose group were analyzed against 4 untreated control tumors ( FIG. 6B ). Target inhibition was observed for the 3 higher dose groups: 200, 100 and 50 mg/kg while the lowest dose group, 25 mg/kg was comparable to endogenous splicing levels in the control group.
