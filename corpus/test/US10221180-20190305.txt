FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical agents useful for therapy and/or prophylaxis in a mammal, and in particular to inhibitors of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK—also known as MAP3K14) useful for treating diseases such as cancer, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders including obesity and diabetes, and autoimmune disorders.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical agents useful for therapy and/or prophylaxis in a mammal, and in particular to inhibitors of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK—also known as MAP3K14) useful for treating diseases such as cancer and inflammatory disorders. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a transcription factor regulating the expression of various genes involved in the immune response, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis. NF-κB dependent transcriptional activation is a tightly controlled signaling pathway, through sequential events including phosphorylation and protein degradation. NIK is a serine/threonine kinase which regulates NF-κB pathway activation. There are two NF-κB signaling pathways, the canonical and the non-canonical. NIK has a role in both but has been shown to be indispensable for the non-canonical signaling pathway where it phosphorylates IKKα, leading to the partial proteolysis of p100; liberating p52 which then heterodimerizes with RelB, translocates to the nucleus and mediates gene expression. The non-canonical pathway is activated by only a handful of ligands such as CD40 ligands, B-cell activating factor (BAFF), lymphotoxin β receptor ligands and TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and NIK has been shown to be required for activation of the pathway by these ligands. Because of its key role, NIK expression is tightly regulated. Under normal non-stimulated conditions NIK protein levels are very low, this is due to its interaction with a range of TNF receptor associated factors (TRAF), which are ubiquitin ligases and result in degradation of NIK. It is believed that when the non-canonical pathway is stimulated by ligands, the activated receptors now compete for TRAFs, dissociating the TRAF-NIK complexes and thereby increasing the levels of NIK. (Thu and Richmond, Cytokine Growth F. R. 2010, 21, 213-226)
Research has shown that blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway in cancer cells can cause cells to stop proliferating, to die and to become more sensitive to the action of other anti-cancer therapies. A role for NIK has been shown in the pathogenesis of both hematological malignancies and solid tumours.
The NF-κB pathway is dysregulated in multiple myeloma due to a range of diverse genetic abnormalities that lead to the engagement of the canonical and non-canonical pathways (Annuziata et al. Cancer Cell 2007, 12, 115-130; Keats et al. ibid 2007, 12, 131-144; Demchenko et al. Blood 2010, 115, 3541-3552). Myeloma patient samples frequently have increased levels of NIK activity. This can be due to chromosomal amplification, translocations (that result in NIK proteins that have lost TRAF binding domains), mutations (in the TRAF binding domain of NIK) or TRAF loss of function mutations. Researchers have shown that myeloma cell lines can be dependent on NIK for proliferation; in these cell lines if NIK activity is reduced by either shRNA or compound inhibition, this leads to a failure in NF-κB signaling and the induction of cell death (Annuziata 2007).
In a similar manner, mutations in TRAF and increased levels of NIK have also been seen in samples from Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients. Once again proliferation of cell lines derived from HL patients is susceptible to inhibition of NIK function by both shRNA and compounds (Ranuncolo et al. Blood First Edition Paper, 2012, DOI 10.1182/blood-2012-01-405951).
NIK levels are also enhanced in adult T cell leukemia (ATL) cells and targeting NIK with shRNA reduced ATL growth in vivo (Saitoh et al. Blood 2008, 111, 5118-5129). It has been demonstrated that the API2-MALT1 fusion oncoprotein created by the recurrent translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma induces proteolytic cleavage of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) at arginine 325. NIK cleavage generates a C-terminal NIK fragment that retains kinase activity and is resistant to proteasomal degradation (due to loss of TRAF binding region). The presence of this truncated NIK leads to constitutive non-canonical NF-κB signaling, enhanced B cell adhesion, and apoptosis resistance. Thus NIK inhibitors could represent a new treatment approach for refractory t(11;18)-positive MALT lymphoma (Rosebeck et al. Science 2011, 331, 468-472).
NIK aberrantly accumulates in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells due to constitutive activation of B-cell activation factor (BAFF) through interaction with autochthonous B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) ligand. NIK accumulation in human DLBCL cell lines and patient tumor samples suggested that constitutive NIK kinase activation is likely to be a key signaling mechanism involved in abnormal lymphoma tumor cell proliferation. Growth assays showed that using shRNA to inhibit NIK kinase protein expression in GCB- and ABC-like DLBCL cells decreased lymphoma cell growth in vitro, implicating NIK-induced NF-κB pathway activation as having a significant role in DLBCL proliferation (Pham et al. Blood 2011, 117, 200-210). As mentioned a role of NIK in tumour cell proliferation is not restricted to hematological cells, there are reports that NIK protein levels are stabilised in some pancreatic cancer cell lines and as seen in blood cells proliferation of these pancreatic cancer lines are susceptible to NIK siRNA treatment (Nishina et al. Biochem. Bioph. Res. Co. 2009, 388, 96-101). Constitutive activation of NF-κB, is preferentially involved in the proliferation of basal-like subtype breast cancer cell lines, including elevated NIK protein levels in specific lines (Yamamoto et al. Cancer Sci. 2010. 101, 2391-2397). In melanoma tumours, tissue microarray analysis of NIK expression revealed that there was a statistically significant elevation in NIK expression when compared with benign tissue. Moreover, shRNA techniques were used to knock-down NIK, the resultant NIK-depleted melanoma cell lines exhibited decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, delayed cell cycle progression and reduced tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model (Thu et al. Oncogene 2011, 1-13). A wealth of evidence showed that NF-κB is often constitutively activated in non-small cell lung cancer tissue specimens and cell lines. Depletion of NIK by RNAi induced apoptosis and affected efficiency of anchorage-independent NSCLC cell growth.
In addition research has shown that NF-κB controls the expression of many genes involved in inflammation and that NF-κB signalling is found to be chronically active in many inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis and others. Thus pharmaceutical agents capable of inhibiting NIK and thereby reducing NF-κB signaling pathway can have a therapeutic benefit for the treatment of diseases and disorders for which over-activation of NF-κB signaling is observed.
Dysregulated NF-κB activity is associated with colonic inflammation and cancer, and it has been shown that Nlrp12 deficient mice were highly susceptible to colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer. In this context work showed that NLRP12 functions as a negative regulator of the NF-κB pathway through its interaction and regulation of NIK and TRAF3, and as a checkpoint of critical pathways associated with inflammation and inflammation-associated tumorigenesis (Allen et al. Immunity 2012, 36, 742-754).
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. In a series of experiments in colonic epithelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, TNF-α mediates both apoptosis and inflammation, stimulating an inflammatory cascade through the non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation, leading to increased nuclear RelB and p52. TNF-α induced the ubiquitination of TRAFs, which interacts with NIK, leading to increased levels of phospho-NIK (Bhattacharyya et al. J Biol. Chem. 2011, 285, 39511-39522).
Inflammatory responses are a key component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as such it has been shown that NIK plays a key role in exacerbating the disease following infection with the Gram-negative bacterium nontypeable Hemophilus influenza (Shuto et al. PNAS 2001, 98, 8774-8779). Likewise cigarette smoke (CS) contains numerous reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, reactive aldehydes, and quinones, which are considered to be some of the most important causes of the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory lung diseases, such as COPD and lung cancer. Increased levels of NIK and p-IKKα have been observed in peripheral lungs of smokers and patients with COPD. In addition it has been shown that endogenous NIK is recruited to promoter sites of pro-inflammatory genes to induce post-translational modification of histones, thereby modifying gene expression profiles, in response to CS or TNFα (Chung et al. PLoS ONE 2011, 6(8): e23488. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023488). A shRNA screen was used in an in vitro model of oxidative stress induced cell death (as a model of COPD) to interrogate a human druggable genome siRNA library in order to identify genes that modulate the cellular response to stress. NIK was one of the genes identified in this screen as a potential new therapeutic target to modulate epithelial apoptosis in chronic lung diseases (Wixted et al. Toxicol. In Vitro 2010, 24, 310-318).
Diabetic individuals can be troubled by a range of additional manifestations associated with inflammation. One such complication is cardiovascular disease and it has been shown that there are elevated levels of p-NIK, p-IKK-α/β and p-IκB-α in diabetic aortic tissues (Bitar et al. Life Sci. 2010, 86, 844-853). In a similar manner, NIK has been shown to regulate proinflammatory responses of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells via mechanisms involving TRAF3. This suggests a role for NF-κB noncanonical pathway activation in modulating diabetes-induced inflammation in renal tubular epithelium (Zhao et al. Exp. Diabetes Res. 2011, 1-9). The same group has shown that NIK plays a critical role in noncanonical NF-κB pathway activation, induced skeletal muscle insulin resistance in vitro, suggesting that NIK could be an important therapeutic target for the treatment of insulin resistance associated with inflammation in obesity and type 2 diabetes (Choudhary et al. Endocrinology 2011, 152, 3622-3627). NF-κB is an important component of both autoimmunity and bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Mice lacking functional NIK have no peripheral lymph nodes, defective B and T cells, and impaired receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-stimulated osteoclastogenesis. Aya et al. (J. Clin. Invest. 2005, 115, 1848-1854) investigated the role of NIK in murine models of inflammatory arthritis using Nik−/− mice. The serum transfer arthritis model was initiated by preformed antibodies and required only intact neutrophil and complement systems in recipients. While Nik−/− mice had inflammation equivalent to that of Nik+/+ controls, they showed significantly less periarticular osteoclastogenesis and less bone erosion. In contrast, Nik−/− mice were completely resistant to antigen-induced arthritis (AIA), which requires intact antigen presentation and lymphocyte function but not lymph nodes. Additionally, transfer of Nik+/+ splenocytes or T cells to Rag2−/− mice conferred susceptibility to AIA, while transfer of Nik−/− cells did not. Nik−/− mice were also resistant to a genetic, spontaneous form of arthritis, generated in mice expressing both the KRN T cell receptor and H-2g7. The same group used transgenic mice with OC-lineage expression of NIK lacking its TRAF3 binding domain (NT3), to demonstrate that constitutive activation of NIK drives enhanced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, both in basal conditions and in response to inflammatory stimuli (Yang et al. PLoS One 2010, 5, 1-9, e15383). Thus this group concluded that NIK is important in the immune and bone-destructive components of inflammatory arthritis and represents a possible therapeutic target for these diseases.
It has also been hypothesized that manipulating levels of NIK in T cells may have therapeutic value. Decreasing NIK activity in T cells might significantly ameliorate autoimmune and alloresponses, like GVHD (Graft Versus Host Disease) and transplant rejection, without crippling the immune system as severely as do inhibitors of canonical NF-κB activation.

The term “composition” is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.
The term “treatment”, as used herein, is intended to refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting or stopping of the progression of a disease, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all symptoms.
The term “compound(s) of the (present) invention” or “compound(s) according to the (present) invention” as used herein, is meant to include the compounds of Formula (I) and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and the solvates thereof.
As used herein, any chemical formula with bonds shown only as solid lines and not as solid wedged or hashed wedged bonds, or otherwise indicated as having a particular configuration (e.g. R, S) around one or more atoms, contemplates each possible stereoisomer, or mixture of two or more stereoisomers.
Hereinbefore and hereinafter, the term “compound(s) of Formula (I)” is meant to include the tautomers thereof and the stereoisomeric forms thereof.
The terms “stereoisomers”, “stereoisomeric forms” or “stereochemically isomeric forms” hereinbefore or hereinafter are used interchangeably.
The invention includes all stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention either as a pure stereoisomer or as a mixture of two or more stereoisomers.
Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a racemate or racemic mixture.
Atropisomers (or atropoisomers) are stereoisomers which have a particular spatial configuration, resulting from a restricted rotation about a single bond, due to large steric hindrance. All atropisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.
Diastereomers (or diastereoisomers) are stereoisomers that are not enantiomers, i.e. they are not related as mirror images. If a compound contains a double bond, the substituents may be in the E or the Z configuration.
Substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration; for example if a compound contains a disubstituted cycloalkyl group, the substituents may be in the cis or trans configuration.
Therefore, the invention includes enantiomers, atropisomers, diastereomers, racemates, E isomers, Z isomers, cis isomers, trans isomers and mixtures thereof, whenever chemically possible.
The meaning of all those terms, i.e. enantiomers, atropisomers, diastereomers, racemates, E isomers, Z isomers, cis isomers, trans isomers and mixtures thereof are known to the skilled person.
The absolute configuration is specified according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system. The configuration at an asymmetric atom is specified by either R or S. Resolved stereoisomers whose absolute configuration is not known can be designated by (+) or (−) depending on the direction in which they rotate plane polarized light. For instance, resolved enantiomers whose absolute configuration is not known can be designated by (+) or (−) depending on the direction in which they rotate plane polarized light.
When a specific stereoisomer is identified, this means that said stereoisomer is substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 50%, preferably less than 20%, more preferably less than 10%, even more preferably less than 5%, in particular less than 2% and most preferably less than 1%, of the other stereoisomers. Thus, when a compound of Formula (I) is for instance specified as (R), this means that the compound is substantially free of the (S) isomer; when a compound of Formula (I) is for instance specified as E, this means that the compound is substantially free of the Z isomer; when a compound of Formula (I) is for instance specified as cis, this means that the compound is substantially free of the trans isomer.
Some of the compounds according to Formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms in so far as they may exist, although not explicitly indicated in the above Formula (I) are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. It follows that a single compound may exist in both stereoisomeric and tautomeric form.
For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of this invention refer to non-toxic “pharmaceutically acceptable salts”. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of compounds according to this invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.

Compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by methods known to those who are skilled in the art. The following schemes are only meant to represent examples of the invention and are in no way meant to be a limit of the invention.
Herein, the term ‘DCM’ means dichloromethane, ‘DMF’ means N,N-dimethylformamide, ‘NMP’ means N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, ‘Et3N’ means triethylamine, ‘TFA’ means trifluoroacetic acid and ‘[Ir(OMe)cod]2’ means (1,5-cyclooctadiene)(methoxy)iridium(I) dimer.
Scheme 1 illustrates a method of preparing compounds of Formula (I), wherein R1-R7 and X are as defined in Formula (I). Intermediates of Formula (II), wherein LG1 is a suitable leaving group such as halogen or triflate, can be reacted with alkynes of Formula (III) under palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling conditions, using for example Pd(PPh3)4, CuI and a base such as Et3N in acetonitrile, with heating, to furnish compounds of Formula (I).
Alkynes of Formula (III), wherein R1 and R2 are as defined in Formula (I), are commercially available or can be prepared by known methods.
Scheme 2 illustrates a further method of preparing compounds of Formula (I), wherein R1-R7 and X are as defined in Formula (I). Intermediates of Formula (IV) can be reacted with alkynes of Formula (III) under palladium-catalysed Sonogashira coupling conditions, using for example Pd(PPh3)4, CuI and a base such as Et3N in acetonitrile, with heating, to furnish intermediates of Formula (V). Büchwald-Hartwig amination of intermediates of Formula (V), using a suitably protected nitrogen species of Formula (VII) such as carbamic acid tert-butyl ester in an appropriate solvent such as 1,4-dioxane gives intermediates of Formula (VI). Removal of the protecting group under suitable conditions such as employing TFA in DCM furnishes compounds of Formula (I).
Additional compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by elaboration of functional groups of compounds within the scope of this invention using standard chemistry. Such elaborations include, but are not limited to, hydrolysis, reduction, oxidation, alkylation, amidation and dehydration. Such transformations may in some instances require the use of protecting groups.
Scheme 3 illustrates a method of preparing intermediates of Formula (II), wherein R3-R7 and X are as defined in Formula (I) and LG1 is as defined above. Intermediates of Formula (IV) can be reacted with 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylamine under basic conditions, for example employing pyridine in a suitable solvent such as NMP with heating, to yield benzylamines of Formula (VIII). The 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl group can be removed under suitable conditions, for example employing TFA with heating to furnish intermediates of Formula (II).
Scheme 4 illustrates a method of preparing intermediates of Formula (IV), wherein R3-R7 and X are as defined in Formula (I) and LG1 is as defined above. Heating intermediates of Formula (X) with boronates of Formula (IX) under palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling conditions, using for example Pd(PPh3)4, Na2CO3 in water and 1,4-dioxane as solvent, yields intermediates of Formula (IV).
Intermediates of Formula (X), wherein R7 is as defined in Formula (I), are commercially available or can be prepared by known methods (Baraldia et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2012, 20, 1046-1059).
Scheme 5 illustrates a further method for preparing intermediates of Formula (IV), wherein R3-R7 and X are as defined in Formula (I) and LG1 is as defined above. Heating intermediates of Formula (X) with hexamethylditin in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 yields intermediates of Formula (XI). Intermediates of Formula (XIII) can be prepared by treating intermediates of Formula (XII) with a mixture of iodine and potassium hydroxide in a suitable solvent such as DMF. Heating intermediates of Formula (XI) and (XIII) under Stille-type coupling conditions, using for example Pd(PPh3)4 and copper(I)-thiophene-2-carboxylate in 1,4-dioxane as a solvent, yields intermediates of Formula (IV).
Scheme 6 illustrates a method of preparing intermediates of Formula (IX), wherein R3-R6 and X are as defined in Formula (I) and LG1 is as defined above. Heating of intermediates of Formula (XII) with an appropriate borane species, such as 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane, under Iridium-catalyzed conditions using for example [Ir(OMe)cod]2 with an appropriate ligand, such as 4,4-di-tert-butyl-2,2-dipyridyl, and cyclohexane as solvent yields boronates of Formula (IX).
Scheme 7 illustrates a method of preparing intermediates of Formula (XII), wherein R3-R6 and X are as defined in Formula (I) and LG1 is as defined above. Treatment of intermediates of Formula (XIII) with a suitable electrophile under basic conditions, such as R6-LG2 (XIV), wherein LG2 is a leaving group such as halogen, mesylate or triflate, using for instance, cesium carbonate in DMF under heating, yields intermediates of Formula (XII).
Intermediates of Formula (XIII) and (XIV), wherein R3-R6 and X is as defined in Formula (I), and LG1 and LG2 are as defined above, are commercially available or can be prepared by known methods (Merour et al. Tet. 2013, 69, 4767-4834; Tabera et al. Tet. 2011 67, 7195-7210).
It will be appreciated that where appropriate functional groups exist, compounds of various Formulae or any intermediates used in their preparation may be further derivatised by one or more standard synthetic methods employing condensation, substitution, oxidation, reduction, or cleavage reactions. Particular substitution approaches include conventional alkylation, arylation, heteroarylation, acylation, sulfonylation, halogenation, nitration, formylation and coupling procedures.
The compounds of Formula (I) may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of Formula (I) containing a basic nitrogen atom may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically.
In the preparation of compounds of the present invention, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary.

In view of the utility of the compounds of Formula (I), or a tautomer or a stereoisomeric form thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or a solvate thereof, there is provided a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, suffering from any one of the diseases mentioned hereinbefore.
Said method comprises the administration, i.e. the systemic or topical administration, preferably oral administration, of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), or a tautomer or a stereoisomeric form thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or a solvate thereof, to warm-blooded animals, including humans.
Therefore, the invention also relates to a method for the treatment of any one of the diseases mentioned hereinbefore comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of compound according to the invention to a patient in need thereof.
One skilled in the art will recognize that a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the present invention is the amount sufficient to have therapeutic activity and that this amount varies inter alias, depending on the type of disease, the concentration of the compound in the therapeutic formulation, and the condition of the patient. Generally, the amount of a compound of the present invention to be administered as a therapeutic agent for treating the disorders referred to herein will be determined on a case by case by an attending physician.
Those of skill in the treatment of such diseases could determine the effective therapeutic daily amount from the test results presented hereinafter. An effective therapeutic daily amount would be from about 0.005 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg, in particular 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight, more in particular from 0.01 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg body weight, preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 15 mg/kg, more preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, even more preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, most preferably from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg body weight. The amount of a compound according to the present invention, also referred to here as the active ingredient, which is required to achieve a therapeutically effect may vary on case-by-case basis, for example with the particular compound, the route of administration, the age and condition of the recipient, and the particular disorder or disease being treated. A method of treatment may also include administering the active ingredient on a regimen of between one and four intakes per day. In these methods of treatment the compounds according to the invention are preferably formulated prior to administration. As described herein below, suitable pharmaceutical formulations are prepared by known procedures using well known and readily available ingredients.
The present invention also provides compositions for preventing or treating the disorders referred to herein. Said compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), or a tautomer or a stereoisomeric form thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or a solvate thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.
While it is possible for the active ingredient to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, the present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to the present invention, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The carrier or diluent must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof.
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy, for example, using methods such as those described in Gennaro et al. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (18th ed., Mack Publishing Company, 1990, see especially Part 8: Pharmaceutical preparations and their Manufacture). A therapeutically effective amount of the particular compound, in base form or addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for systemic administration such as oral, percutaneous or parenteral administration; or topical administration such as via inhalation, a nose spray, eye drops or via a cream, gel, shampoo or the like. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions: or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment.
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.
The present compounds can be used for systemic administration such as oral, percutaneous or parenteral administration; or topical administration such as via inhalation, a nose spray, eye drops or via a cream, gel, shampoo or the like. The compounds are preferably orally administered. The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of Formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, sex, extent of disorder and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention.
The compounds of the present invention may be administered alone or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. Combination therapy includes administration of a single pharmaceutical dosage formulation which contains a compound according to the present invention and one or more additional therapeutic agents, as well as administration of the compound according to the present invention and each additional therapeutic agent in its own separate pharmaceutical dosage formulation. For example, a compound according to the present invention and a therapeutic agent may be administered to the patient together in a single oral dosage composition such as a tablet or capsule, or each agent may be administered in separate oral dosage formulations.
For the treatment of the above conditions, the compounds of the invention may be advantageously employed in combination with one or more other medicinal agents, more particularly, with other anti-cancer agents or adjuvants in cancer therapy.

Pharmacological Part
Biological Assay A
Inhibition of Auto-Phosphorylation of Recombinant Human NF-kappaB-Inducing Kinase (NIK/MAP3K14) Activity (AlphaScreen®)
NIK/MAP3K14 auto-phosphorylation activity was measured using the AlphaScreen® (αscreen) format (Perkin Elmer). All compounds tested were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and further dilutions were made in assay buffer. Final DMSO concentration was 1% (v/v) in assays. Assay buffer was 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 1 mM EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid), 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween® 20. Assays were carried out in 384 well Alphaplates (Perkin Elmer). Incubations consisted of compound, 25 microM Adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), and 0.2 nM NIK/MAP3K14. Incubations were initiated by addition of GST-tagged NIK/MAP3K14 enzyme, carried out for 1 h at 25° C. and terminated by addition of stop buffer containing anti-phospho-IKK Ser176/180 antibody. Protein A Acceptor and Glutathione-Donor beads were added before reading using an EnVision® Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer). Signal obtained in the wells containing blank samples was subtracted from all other wells and IC50's were determined by fitting a sigmoidal curve to % inhibition of control versus Log10 compound concentration.
Biological Assay B
Effect of Compounds on P-IKKα Levels in L363 Cells
All compounds tested were dissolved in DMSO and further dilutions were made in culture medium. Final DMSO concentration was 1% (v/v) in cell assays. The human L363 cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with GlutaMax and 10% fetal calf serum (PAA). Cells were routinely maintained at densities of 0.2×106 cells per ml-1×106 cells per ml at 37° C. in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were passaged twice a week splitting back to obtain the low density. Cells were seeded in 96 well plates (Nunc 167008) at 2×106 per ml media in a volume of 75 μl per well plus 25 μl 1 μg/ml recombinant human B-cell activating factor (BAFF/BLyS/TNFSF13B). Seeded cells were incubated at 37° C. in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 hr. Drugs and/or solvents were added (20 μl) to a final volume of 120 μl. Following 2 hr treatment plates were removed from the incubator and cell lysis was achieved by the addition of 30 μl 5× lysis buffer followed by shaking on a plate shaker at 4° C. for 10 min. At the end of this incubation lysed cells were centrifuged at 800×g for 20 min at 4° C. and the lysate was assessed for P-IKKα levels by sandwich immuno-assay carried out in anti-rabbit antibody coated Mesoscale plates. Within an experiment, the results for each treatment were the mean of 2 replicate wells. For initial screening purposes, compounds were tested using an 8 point dilution curve (serial 1:3 dilutions). For each experiment, controls (containing MG132 and BAFF but no test drug) and a blank incubation (containing MG132 and BAFF and 10 μM ADS125117, a test concentration known to give full inhibition) were run in parallel. The blank incubation value was subtracted from all control and sample values. To determine the IC50 a sigmoidal curve was fitted to the plot of % inhibition of control P-IKKα levels versus Log10 compound concentration.
Biological Assay C
Determination of Antiproliferative Activity on LP-1, L-363 and JJN-3 Cells
All compounds tested were dissolved in DMSO and further dilutions were made in culture medium. Final DMSO concentration was 0.3% (v/v) in cell proliferation assays. Viability was assessed using CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay kit (Promega). The human LP-1, L-363 and JJN-3 cells (DSMZ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum (PAA). Cells were routinely kept as suspension cells at 37° C. in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were passaged at a seeding density of 0.2×106/ml twice a week. Cells were seeded in black tissue culture treated 96-well plates (Perkin Elmer). Densities used for plating ranged from 2,000 to 6,000 cells per well in a total volume of 75 μl medium. After twenty four hours, drugs and/or solvents were added (25 μl) to a final volume of 100 μl. Following 72 hr of treatment plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for approx 10 min. 100 μl CellTiter-Glo reagent was added to each well that was then covered (Perkin Elmer Topseal) and shaken on plate shaker for 10 min. Luminescence was measured on a HTS Topcount (Perkin Elmer). Within an experiment, the results for each treatment were the mean of 2 replicate wells. For initial screening purposes, compounds were tested using a 9 point dilution curve (serial 1:3 dilutions). For each experiment, controls (containing no drug) and a blank incubation (containing cells read at the time of compound addition) were run in parallel. The blank value was subtracted from all control and sample values. For each sample, the mean value for cell growth (in relative light units) was expressed as a percentage of the mean value for cell growth of the control.
