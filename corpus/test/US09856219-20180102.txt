FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention is directed to novel quinoline compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of making and using the same. These compounds are useful as inhibitors of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR).
BACKGROUND
The chemical compound nitric oxide is a gas with chemical formula NO. NO is one of the few gaseous signaling molecules known in biological systems, and plays an important role in controlling various biological events. For example, the endothelium uses NO to signal surrounding smooth muscle in the walls of arterioles to relax, resulting in vasodilation and increased blood flow to hypoxic tissues. NO is also involved in regulating smooth muscle proliferation, platelet function, and neurotransmission, and plays a role in host defense. Although NO is highly reactive and has a lifetime of a few seconds, it can both diffuse freely across membranes and bind to many molecular targets. These attributes make NO an ideal signaling molecule capable of controlling biological events between adjacent cells and within cells.
NO is a free radical gas, which makes it reactive and unstable, thus NO is short lived in vivo, having a half life of 3-5 seconds under physiologic conditions. In the presence of oxygen, NO can combine with thiols to generate a biologically important class of stable NO adducts called S-nitrosothiols (SNO's). This stable pool of NO has been postulated to act as a source of bioactive NO and as such appears to be critically important in health and disease, given the centrality of NO in cellular homeostasis (Stamler et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:7674-7677 (1992)). Protein SNO's play broad roles in the function of cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, gastrointestinal, immune, and central nervous system (Foster et al., Trends in Molecular Medicine, 9 (4):160-168, (2003)). One of the most studied SNO's in biological systems is S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) (Gaston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:10957-10961 (1993)), an emerging key regulator in NO signaling since it is an efficient trans-nitrosating agent and appears to maintain an equilibrium with other S-nitrosated proteins (Liu et al., Nature, 410:490-494 (2001)) within cells. Given this pivotal position in the NO-SNO continuum, GSNO provides a therapeutically promising target to consider when NO modulation is pharmacologically warranted.
In light of this understanding of GSNO as a key regulator of NO homeostasis and cellular SNO levels, studies have focused on examining endogenous production of GSNO and SNO proteins, which occurs downstream from the production of the NO radical by the nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) enzymes. More recently there has been an increasing understanding of enzymatic catabolism of GSNO which has an important role in governing available concentrations of GSNO and consequently available NO and SNO's.
Central to this understanding of GSNO catabolism, researchers have recently identified a highly conserved S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) (Jensen et al., Biochem J., 331:659-668 (1998); Liu et al., (2001)). GSNOR is also known as glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (GSH-FDH), alcohol dehydrogenase 3 (ADH-3) (Uotila and Koivusalo, Coenzymes and Cofactors, D. Dolphin, ed. pp. 517-551 (New York, John Wiley & Sons, (1989)), and alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH-5). Importantly GSNOR shows greater activity toward GSNO than other substrates (Jensen et al., (1998); Liu et al., (2001)) and appears to mediate important protein and peptide denitrosating activity in bacteria, plants, and animals. GSNOR appears to be the major GSNO-metabolizing enzyme in eukaryotes (Liu et al., (2001)). Thus, GSNO can accumulate in biological compartments where GSNOR activity is low or absent (e.g., airway lining fluid) (Gaston et al., (1993)).
Yeast deficient in GSNOR accumulate S-nitrosylated proteins which are not substrates of the enzyme, which is strongly suggestive that GSNO exists in equilibrium with SNO-proteins (Liu et al., (2001)). Precise enzymatic control over ambient levels of GSNO and thus SNO-proteins raises the possibility that GSNO/GSNOR may play roles across a host of physiological and pathological functions including protection against nitrosative stress wherein NO is produced in excess of physiologic needs. Indeed, GSNO specifically has been implicated in physiologic processes ranging from the drive to breathe (Lipton et al., Nature, 413:171-174 (2001)) to regulation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (Zaman et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 284:65-70 (2001)), to regulation of vascular tone, thrombosis, and platelet function (de Belder et al., Cardiovasc Res.; 28(5):691-4 (1994)), Z. Kaposzta, et al., Circulation; 106(24): 3057-3062, (2002)) as well as host defense (de Jesus-Berrios et al., Curr. Biol., 13:1963-1968 (2003)). Other studies have found that GSNOR protects yeast cells against nitrosative stress both in vitro (Liu et al., (2001)) and in vivo (de Jesus-Berrios et al., (2003)).
Collectively, data suggest GSNO as a primary physiological ligand for the enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), which catabolizes GSNO and consequently reduces available SNO's and NO in biological systems (Liu et al., (2001)), (Liu et al., Cell, 116(4), 617-628 (2004)), and (Que et al., Science, 308, (5728):1618-1621 (2005)). As such, this enzyme plays a central role in regulating local and systemic bioactive NO. Since perturbations in NO bioavailability has been linked to the pathogenesis of numerous disease states, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, asthma, gastrointestinal disorders, inflammation, and cancer, agents that regulate GSNOR activity are candidate therapeutic agents for treating diseases associated with NO imbalance.
Nitric oxide (NO), S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) regulate normal lung physiology and contribute to lung pathophysiology. Under normal conditions, NO and GSNO maintain normal lung physiology and function via their anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory actions. Lowered levels of these mediators in pulmonary diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may occur via up-regulation of GSNOR enzyme activity. These lowered levels of NO and GSNO, and thus lowered anti-inflammatory capabilities, are key events that contribute to pulmonary diseases and which can potentially be reversed via GSNOR inhibition.
S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) has been shown to promote repair and/or regeneration of mammalian organs, such as the heart (Lima et al., 2010), blood vessels (Lima et al., 2010) skin (Georgii et al., 2010), eye or ocular structures (Haq et al., 2007) and liver (Prince et al., 2010). S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) is the major catabolic enzyme of GSNO. Inhibition of GSNOR is thought to increase endogenous GSNO.
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD's), including Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, in which NO, GSNO, and GSNOR can exert influences. Under normal conditions, NO and GSNO function to maintain normal intestinal physiology via anti-inflammatory actions and maintenance of the intestinal epithelial cell barrier. In IBD, reduced levels of GSNO and NO are evident and likely occur via up-regulation of GSNOR activity. The lowered levels of these mediators contribute to the pathophysiology of IBD via disruption of the epithelial barrier via dysregulation of proteins involved in maintaining epithelial tight junctions. This epithelial barrier dysfunction, with the ensuing entry of micro-organisms from the lumen, and the overall lowered anti-inflammatory capabilities in the presence of lowered NO and GSNO, are key events in IBD progression that can be potentially influenced by targeting GSNOR.
Cell death is the crucial event leading to clinical manifestation of hepatotoxicity from drugs, viruses and alcohol. Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant redox molecule in cells and thus the most important determinant of cellular redox status. Thiols in proteins undergo a wide range of reversible redox modifications during times of exposure to reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, which can affect protein activity. The maintenance of hepatic GSH is a dynamic process achieved by a balance between rates of GSH synthesis, GSH and GSSG efflux, GSH reactions with reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species and utilization by GSH peroxidase. Both GSNO and GSNOR play roles in the regulation of protein redox status by GSH.
Acetaminophen overdoses are the leading cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the United States, Great Britain and most of Europe. More than 100,000 calls to the U.S. Poison Control Centers, 56,000 emergency room visits, 2600 hospitalizations, nearly 500 deaths are attributed to acetaminophen in this country annually. Approximately, 60% recover without needing a liver transplant, 9% are transplanted and 30% of patients succumb to the illness. The acetaminophen-related death rate exceeds by at least three-fold the number of deaths due to all other idiosyncratic drug reactions combined (Lee, Hepatol Res 2008; 38 (Suppl. 1):S3-S8).
Liver transplantation has become the primary treatment for patients with fulminant hepatic failure and end-stage chronic liver disease, as well as certain metabolic liver diseases. Thus, the demand for transplantation now greatly exceeds the availability of donor organs. It has been estimated that more than 18 000 patients are currently registered with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and that an additional 9000 patients are added to the liver transplant waiting list each year, yet less than 5000 cadaveric donors are available for transplantation.
Currently, there is a great need in the art for diagnostics, prophylaxis, ameliorations, and treatments for medical conditions relating to increased NO synthesis and/or increased NO bioactivity. In addition, there is a significant need for novel compounds, compositions, and methods for preventing, ameliorating, or reversing other NO-associated disorders. The present invention satisfies these needs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
A. Overview of the Invention
Until recently, S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) was known to oxidize the formaldehyde glutathione adduct, S-hydroxymethylglutathione. GSNOR has since been identified in a variety of bacteria, yeasts, plants, and animals and is well conserved. The proteins from E. coli, S. cerevisiae and mouse macrophages share over 60% amino acid sequence identity. GSNOR activity (i.e., decomposition of GSNO when NADH is present as a required cofactor) has been detected in E. coli, in mouse macrophages, in mouse endothelial cells, in mouse smooth muscle cells, in yeasts, and in human HeLa, epithelial, and monocyte cells. Human GSNOR nucleotide and amino acid sequence information can be obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases under Accession Nos. M29872, NM_000671. Mouse GSNOR nucleotide and amino acid sequence information can be obtained from NCBI databases under Accession Nos. NM_007410. In the nucleotide sequence, the start site and stop site are underlined. CDS designates coding sequence. SNP designates single nucleotide polymorphism. Other related GSNOR nucleotide and amino acid sequences, including those of other species, can be found in U.S. Patent Application 2005/0014697.
In accord with the present invention, GSNOR has been shown to function in vivo and in vitro to metabolize S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and protein S-nitrosothiols (SNOs) to modulate NO bioactivity, by controlling the intracellular levels of low mass NO donor compounds and preventing protein nitrosylation from reaching toxic levels.
Based on this, it follows that inhibition of this enzyme potentiates bioactivity in diseases in which NO donor therapy is indicated, inhibits the proliferation of pathologically proliferating cells, and increases NO bioactivity in diseases where this is beneficial.

For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. The pharmaceutical composition should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.
The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion, and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol or sorbitol, and inorganic salts such as sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active reagent in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating at least one compound of the invention into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and any other required ingredient. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, exemplary methods of preparation include vacuum drying and freeze-drying, both of which yield a powder of a compound of the invention plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.
Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed, for example, in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the compound of the invention can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition.
For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser that contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, a nebulized liquid, or a dry powder from a suitable device. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active reagents are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The reagents can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery.
In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are prepared with carriers that will protect against rapid elimination from the body. For example, a controlled release formulation can be used, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811.
Additionally, suspensions of the compounds of the invention may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate, triglycerides, or liposomes. Non-lipid polycationic amino polymers may also be used for delivery. Optionally, the suspension may also include suitable stabilizers or agents to increase the solubility of the compounds and allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.
It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of the compound of the invention calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the compound of the invention and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active agent for the treatment of individuals.
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention comprising at least one compound of the invention can comprise one or more pharmaceutical excipients. Examples of such excipients include, but are not limited to binding agents, filling agents, lubricating agents, suspending agents, sweeteners, flavoring agents, preservatives, buffers, wetting agents, disintegrants, effervescent agents, and other excipients.

F. Methods of Preparing Compounds of the Invention
The compounds of the invention can readily be synthesized using known synthetic methodologies or via a modification of known synthetic methodologies. As would be readily recognized by a skilled artisan, the methodologies described below allow the synthesis of quinolines having a variety of substituents. Exemplary synthetic methods are described in the Examples section below.
If needed, further purification and separation of enantiomers and diastereomers can be achieved by routine procedures known in the art. Thus, for example, the separation of enantiomers of a compound can be achieved by the use of chiral HPLC and related chromatographic techniques. Diastereomers can be similarly separated. In some instances, however, diastereomers can simply be separated physically, such as, for example, by controlled precipitation or crystallization.
The process of the invention, when carried out as prescribed herein, can be conveniently performed at temperatures that are routinely accessible in the art. In one embodiment, the process is performed at a temperature in the range of about 25ยฐ C. to about 110ยฐ C. In another embodiment, the temperature is in the range of about 40ยฐ C. to about 100ยฐ C. In yet another embodiment, the temperature is in the range of about 50ยฐ C. to about 95ยฐ C.
Synthetic steps that require a base are carried out using any convenient organic or inorganic base. Typically, the base is not nucleophilic. Thus, in one embodiment, the base is selected from carbonates, phosphates, hydroxides, alkoxides, salts of disilazanes, and tertiary amines.
The process of the invention, when performed as described herein, can be substantially complete after several minutes to after several hours depending upon the nature and quantity of reactants and reaction temperature. The determination of when the reaction is substantially complete can be conveniently evaluated by ordinary techniques known in the art such as, for example, HPLC, LCMS, TLC, and 1H NMR.

The patient can be any animal, domestic, livestock, or wild, including, but not limited to cats, dogs, horses, pigs, and cattle, and preferably human patients. As used herein, the terms patient and subject may be used interchangeably.
As used herein, โtreatingโ describes the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating a disease, condition, or disorder and includes the administration of a compound of the present invention to prevent the onset of the symptoms or complications, alleviating the symptoms or complications, or eliminating the disease, condition, or disorder. More specifically, โtreatingโ includes reversing, attenuating, alleviating, minimizing, suppressing, or halting at least one deleterious symptom or effect of a disease (disorder) state, disease progression, disease causative agent (e.g., bacteria or viruses), or other abnormal condition. Treatment is continued as long as symptoms and/or pathology ameliorate.
In general, the dosage, i.e., the therapeutically effective amount, ranges from 1 ฮผg/kg to 10 g/kg and often ranges from 10 ฮผg/kg to 1 g/kg or 10 ฮผg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight of the subject being treated, per day.
H. GSNOR Uses
In subjects with deleteriously high levels of GSNOR or GSNOR activity, modulation may be achieved, for example, by administering one or more of the disclosed compounds that disrupts or down-regulates GSNOR function, or decreases GSNOR levels. These compounds may be administered with other GSNOR inhibitor agents, such as anti-GSNOR antibodies or antibody fragments, GSNOR antisense, iRNA, or small molecules, or other inhibitors, alone or in combination with other agents as described in detail herein.
The present invention provides a method of treating a subject afflicted with a disorder ameliorated by NO donor therapy. Such a method comprises administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a GSNOR inhibitor.
The disorders can include pulmonary disorders associated with hypoxemia and/or smooth muscle constriction in the lungs and airways and/or lung infection and/or lung inflammation and/or lung injury (e.g., pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, asthma, pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis/interstitial lung diseases, cystic fibrosis, COPD); cardiovascular disease and heart disease (e.g., hypertension, ischemic coronary syndromes, atherosclerosis, heart failure, glaucoma); diseases characterized by angiogenesis (e.g., coronary artery disease); disorders where there is risk of thrombosis occurring; disorders where there is risk of restenosis occurring; inflammatory diseases (e.g., AIDS related dementia, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, colitis, and psoriasis); functional bowel disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)); diseases where there is risk of apoptosis occurring (e.g., heart failure, atherosclerosis, degenerative neurologic disorders, arthritis, and liver injury (e.g., drug induced, ischemic or alcoholic)); impotence; sleep apnea; diabetic wound healing; cutaneous infections; treatment of psoriasis; obesity caused by eating in response to craving for food; stroke; reperfusion injury (e.g., traumatic muscle injury in heart or lung or crush injury); and disorders where preconditioning of heart or brain for NO protection against subsequent ischemic events is beneficial, central nervous system (CNS) disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosis, and schizophrenia); and infections caused by bacteria (e.g., tuberculosis, C. difficile infections, among others).
In one embodiment, the disorder is liver injury. Liver injury can include, for example, acute liver toxicity. Acute liver toxicity can result in acute liver failure. Acute liver failure (ALF) is an uncommon but potentially lethal drug-related adverse effect that often leads to liver transplantation (LT) or death. Acetaminophen is the most common cause of acute liver toxicity and acute liver failure, although acute liver toxicity can be clue to other agents, such as alcohol and other drugs. Regardless of whether it occurs as a result of a single overdose or after repeated supratherapeutic ingestion, the progression of acetaminophen poisoning can be categorized into four stages: preclinical toxic effects (a normal serum alanine aminotransferase concentration), hepatic injury (an elevated alanine aminotransferase concentration), hepatic failure (hepatic injury with hepatic encephalopathy), and recovery. As long as sufficient glutathione is present, the liver is protected from injury. Overdoses of acetaminophen (either a single large ingestion or repeated supratherapeutic ingestion) can deplete hepatic glutathione stores and allow liver injury to occur. Compounds of the invention are capable of treating and/or preventing liver injury and/or acute liver toxicity. In this embodiment, appropriate amounts of compounds of the present invention are an amount sufficient to treat and/or prevent liver injury and can be determined without undue experimentation by preclinical and/or clinical trials. In one embodiment, the amount to treat is at least 0.001 mg/kg, at least 0.002 mg/kg, at least 0.003 mg/kg, at least 0.004 mg/kg, at least 0.005 mg/kg, at least 0.006 mg/kg, at least 0.007 mg/kg, at least 0.008 mg/kg, at least 0.009 mg/kg, at least 0.01 mg/kg, at least 0.02 mg/kg, at least 0.03 mg/kg, at least 0.04 mg/kg, at least 0.05 mg/kg, at least at least 0.06 mg/kg, at least 0.07 mg/kg, at least 0.08 mg/kg, at least 0.09 mg/kg, at least 0.1 mg/kg, at least 0.2 mg/kg, at least 0.3 mg/kg, at least 0.4 mg/kg, at least 0.5 mg/kg, at least 0.6 mg/kg, at least 0.7 mg/kg, at least 0.8 mg/kg, at least 0.9 mg/kg, at least 1 mg/kg, at least 1.5 mg/kg, at least 2 mg/kg, at least 2.5 mg/kg, at least 3 mg/kg, at least 3.5 mg/kg, at least 4 mg/kg, at least 4.5 mg/kg, at least 5 mg/kg, at least 6 mg/kg, at least 7 mg/kg, at least 8 mg/kg, at least 9 mg/kg, at least 10 mg/kg, at least 15 mg/kg, at least 20 mg/kg, at least 30 mg/kg, at least 40 mg/kg, at least 50 mg/kg, at least 60 mg/kg, at least 70 mg/kg, at least 80 mg/kg, at least 90 mg/kg, at least 100 mg/kg. The dosing can be hourly, four times, twice, or once daily, or four times, twice, or once per week, or weekly, or every other week, every third week, or monthly.
In one embodiment, the disorder is trauma (including surgery and thermal), infectious, toxic, aging, and ischemic damage to organs of known regenerative capacity, such as skin, gastric mucosa, airway epithelial and cartilaginous structures, liver, neuronal structures such as the spinal cord, bone marrow and bone. We have shown that inhibition of GSNOR by the use of highly specific small molecules treats, repairs, and promotes regeneration of mammalian tissue. By way of example, small molecule inhibitors are effective in treating, and promoting repair and regeneration of mammalian lung tissue damaged by instillation of a chemical agent known to cause severe lung injury (porcine pancreatic elastase) (Blonder et al., ATS 2011 abstract reference). In this embodiment, appropriate amounts of compounds of the present invention are an amount sufficient to regenerate tissue/organs and can be determined without undue experimentation by preclinical and/or clinical trials.
In one embodiment the disorder is trauma (including surgery and thermal), infectious, toxic, aging, and ischemic damage to organs of not commonly known to have regenerative capacity. Examples include regeneration of: the heart, the lung, the kidney, the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, peripheral vascular tissue, liver, pancreas, adrenal gland, thyroid, testes, ovary, retina, tongue, bone, bladder, esophagus, larynx, thymus, spleen, cartilaginous structures of the head, and cartilaginous structures of the joints. In this embodiment, appropriate amounts of compounds of the present invention are an amount sufficient to regenerate tissue/organs and can be determined without undue experimentation by preclinical and/or clinical trials.
In one embodiment ex and in vivo implantation and regeneration of organs and structures, including stem cells. In this embodiment, appropriate amounts of compounds of the present invention are an amount sufficient to regenerate tissue/organs and can be determined without undue experimentation by preclinical and/or clinical trials.
In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a prodrug, stereoisomer, metabolite, or N-oxide thereof, can be administered in combination with an NO donor. An NO donor donates nitric oxide or a related redox species and more generally provides nitric oxide bioactivity, that is activity which is identified with nitric oxide, e.g., vasorelaxation or stimulation or inhibition of a receptor protein, e.g., ras protein, adrenergic receptor, NFฮบB. NO donors including S-nitroso, O-nitroso, C-nitroso, and N-nitroso compounds and nitro derivatives thereof and metal NO complexes, but not excluding other NO bioactivity generating compounds, useful herein are described in โMethods in Nitric Oxide Research,โ Feelisch et al. eds., pages 71-115 (J. S., John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1996), which is incorporated herein by reference. NO donors which are C-nitroso compounds where nitroso is attached to a tertiary carbon which are useful herein include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,359,182 and in WO 02/34705. Examples of S-nitroso compounds, including S-nitrosothiols useful herein, include, for example, S-nitrosoglutathione, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, S-nitroso-cysteine and ethyl ester thereof, S-nitroso cysteinyl glycine, S-nitroso-gamma-methyl-L-homocysteine, S-nitroso-L-homocysteine, S-nitroso-gamma-thio-L-leucine, S-nitroso-delta-thio-L-leucine, and S-nitrosoalbumin. Examples of other NO donors useful herein are sodium nitroprusside (nipride), ethyl nitrite, isosorbide, nitroglycerin, SIN 1 which is molsidomine, furoxamines, N-hydroxy (N-nitrosamine), and perfluorocarbons that have been saturated with NO or a hydrophobic NO donor.
The combination of a GSNOR inhibitor with R(+) enantiomer of amlodipine, a known NO releaser (Zhang at al., J. Cardiovasc. Pharm. 39: 208-214 (2002)) is also an embodiment of the present invention.
The present invention also provides a method of treating a subject afflicted with pathologically proliferating cells where the method comprises administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of GSNOR. The inhibitors of GSNOR are the compounds as defined above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a stereoisomer, prodrug, metabolite, or N-oxide thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Treatment is continued as long as symptoms and/or pathology ameliorate.
In another embodiment, the pathologically proliferating cells can be pathologically proliferating microbes. The microbes involved can be those where GSNOR is expressed to protect the microbe from nitrosative stress or where a host cell infected with the microbe expresses the enzyme, thereby protecting the microbe from nitrosative stress. The term โpathologically proliferating microbesโ is used herein to mean pathologic microorganisms including, but not limited to, pathologic bacteria, pathologic viruses, pathologic Chlamydia, pathologic protozoa, pathologic Rickettsia, pathologic fungi, and pathologic mycoplasmata. More detail on the applicable microbes is set forth at columns 11 and 12 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,057,367. The term โhost cells infected with pathologic microbesโ includes not only mammalian cells infected with pathologic viruses but also mammalian cells containing intracellular bacteria or protozoa, e.g., macrophages containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leper (leprosy), or Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever).
In another embodiment, the pathologically proliferating cells can be pathologic helminths. The term โpathologic helminthsโ is used herein to refer to pathologic nematodes, pathologic trematodes and pathologic cestodes. More detail on the applicable helminths is set forth at column 12 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,057,367.
In another embodiment, the pathologically proliferating cells can be pathologically proliferating mammalian cells. The term โpathologically proliferating mammalian cellsโ as used herein means cells of the mammal that grow in size or number in said mammal so as to cause a deleterious effect in the mammal or its organs. The term includes, for example, the pathologically proliferating or enlarging cells causing restenosis, the pathologically proliferating or enlarging cells causing benign prostatic hypertrophy, the pathologically proliferating cells causing myocardial hypertrophy, and proliferating cells at inflammatory sites such as synovial cells in arthritis or cells associated with a cell proliferation disorder.
As used herein, the term โcell proliferative disorderโ refers to conditions in which the unregulated and/or abnormal growth of cells can lead to the development of an unwanted condition or disease, which can be cancerous or non-cancerous, for example a psoriatic condition. As used herein, the term โpsoriatic conditionโ refers to disorders involving keratinocyte hyperproliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cytokine alteration. The cell proliferative disorder can be a precancerous condition or cancer. The cancer can be primary cancer or metastatic cancer, or both.
As used herein, the term โcancerโ includes solid tumors, such as lung, breast, colon, ovarian, pancreas, prostate, adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma, sarcoma, malignant glioma, leiomyosarcoma, hepatoma, head and neck cancer, malignant melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers, as well as hematologic tumors and/or malignancies, such as leukemia, childhood leukemia and lymphomas, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease, lymphomas of lymphocytic and cutaneous origin, acute and chronic leukemia such as acute lymphoblastic, acute myelocytic, or chronic myelocytic leukemia, plasma cell neoplasm, lymphoid neoplasm, and cancers associated with AIDS.
In addition to psoriatic conditions, the types of proliferative diseases which may be treated using the compositions of the present invention are epidermic and dermoid cysts, lipomas, adenomas, capillary and cutaneous hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, nevi lesions, teratomas, nephromas, myofibromatosis, osteoplastic tumors, and other dysplastic masses, and the like. In one embodiment, proliferative diseases include dysplasias and disorders of the like.
In one embodiment, treating cancer comprises a reduction in tumor size, decrease in tumor number, a delay of tumor growth, decrease in metastatic lesions in other tissues or organs distant from the primary tumor site, an improvement in the survival of patients, or an improvement in the quality of patient life, or at least two of the above.
In another embodiment, treating a cell proliferative disorder comprises a reduction in the rate of cellular proliferation, reduction in the proportion of proliferating cells, a decrease in size of an area or zone of cellular proliferation, or a decrease in the number or proportion of cells having an abnormal appearance or morphology, or at least two of the above.
In yet another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a stereoisomer thereof, a prodrug thereof, a metabolite thereof, or an N-oxide thereof can be administered in combination with a second chemotherapeutic agent. In a further embodiment, the second chemotherapeutic agent is selected from the group consisting of tamoxifen, raloxifene, anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole, cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, lovastatin, minosine, gemcitabine, araC, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, docetaxel, goserelin, vincristin, vinblastin, nocodazole, teniposide, etoposide, epothilone, navelbine, camptothecin, daunonibicin, dactinomycin, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin imatanib, gefitinib, erlotinib, sorafenib, sunitinib malate, trastuzumab, rituximab, cetuximab, and bevacizumab.
In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a stereoisomer thereof, a prodrug thereof, a metabolite thereof, or an N-oxide thereof, can be administered in combination with an agent that imposes nitrosative or oxidative stress. Agents for selectively imposing nitrosative stress to inhibit proliferation of pathologically proliferating cells in combination therapy with GSNOR inhibitors herein and dosages and routes of administration therefor include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,057,367, which is incorporated herein. Supplemental agents for imposing oxidative stress (i.e., agents that increase GSSG (oxidized glutathione) over GSH (glutathione) ratio or NAD(P) over NAD(P)H ratio or increase thiobarbituric acid derivatives) in combination therapy with GSNOR inhibitors herein include, for example, L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine (BSO), glutathione reductase inhibitors (e.g., BCNU), inhibitors or uncouplers of mitochondrial respiration, and drugs that increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), e.g., adriamycin, in standard dosages with standard routes of administration.
GSNOR inhibitors may also be co-administered with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (e.g., rolipram, cilomilast, roflumilast, Viagraยฎ (sildenifil citrate), Cialisยฎ (tadalafil), Levitraยฎ (vardenifil), etc.), a ฮฒ-agonist, a steroid, an anti-muscarinics, or a leukotriene antagonist (LTD-4). Those skilled in the art can readily determine the appropriate therapeutically effective amount depending on the disorder to be ameliorated.
GSNOR inhibitors may be used as a means to improve ฮฒ-adrenergic signaling. In particular, inhibitors of GSNOR alone or in combination with ฮฒ-agonists could be used to treat or protect against heart failure, or other vascular disorders such as hypertension and asthma. GSNOR inhibitors can also be used to modulate G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) by potentiating Gs G-protein, leading to smooth muscle relaxation (e.g., airway and blood vessels), and by attenuating Gq G-protein, and thereby preventing smooth muscle contraction (e.g., in airway and blood vessels).
The therapeutically effective amount for the treatment of a subject afflicted with a disorder ameliorated by NO donor therapy is the GSNOR inhibiting amount in vivo that causes amelioration of the disorder being treated or protects against a risk associated with the disorder. For example, for asthma, a therapeutically effective amount is a bronchodilating effective amount; for cystic fibrosis, a therapeutically effective amount is an airway obstruction ameliorating effective amount; for ARDS, a therapeutically effective amount is a hypoxemia ameliorating effective amount; for heart disease, a therapeutically effective amount is an angina relieving or angiogenesis inducing effective amount; for hypertension, a therapeutically effective amount is a blood pressure reducing effective amount; for ischemic coronary disorders, a therapeutic amount is a blood flow increasing effective amount; for atherosclerosis, a therapeutically effective amount is an endothelial dysfunction reversing effective amount; for glaucoma, a therapeutic amount is an intraocular pressure reducing effective amount; for diseases characterized by angiogenesis, a therapeutically effective amount is an angiogenesis inhibiting effective amount; for disorders where there is risk of thrombosis occurring, a therapeutically effective amount is a thrombosis preventing effective amount; for disorders where there is risk of restenosis occurring, a therapeutically effective amount is a restenosis inhibiting effective amount; for chronic inflammatory diseases, a therapeutically effective amount is an inflammation reducing effective amount; for disorders where there is risk of apoptosis occurring, a therapeutically effective amount is an apoptosis preventing effective amount; for impotence, a therapeutically effective amount is an erection attaining or sustaining effective amount; for obesity, a therapeutically effective amount is a satiety causing effective amount; for stroke, a therapeutically effective amount is a blood flow increasing or a TIA protecting effective amount; for reperfusion injury, a therapeutically effective amount is a function increasing effective amount; and for preconditioning of heart and brain, a therapeutically effective amount is a cell protective effective amount, e.g., as measured by troponin or CPK.
The therapeutically effective amount for the treatment of a subject afflicted with pathologically proliferating cells means a GSNOR inhibiting amount in vivo which is an antiproliferative effective amount. Such antiproliferative effective amount as used herein means an amount causing reduction in rate of proliferation of at least about 20%, at least about 10%, at least about 5%, or at least about 1%.

GSNOR expression and purification is described in Biochemistry 2000, 39, 10720-10729.
GSNOR Fermentation:
Pre-cultures were grown from stabs of a GSNOR glycerol stock in 2XYT media containing 100 ug/ml ampicillin after an overnight incubation at 37ยฐ C. Cells were then added to fresh 2XYT (4 L) containing ampicillin and grown to an OD (A600) of 0.6-0.9 at 37ยฐ C. before induction.

Example 59: Efficacy of GSNORi in Experimental Asthma
Experimental Asthma Model:
A mouse model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma was used to screen GSNOR inhibitors for efficacy against methacholine (MCh)-induced bronchoconstriction/airway hyper-responsiveness. This is a widely used and well characterized model that presents with an acute, allergic asthma phenotype with similarities to human asthma. Efficacy of GSNOR inhibitors was assessed using a protocol in which GSNOR inhibitors were administered after OVA sensitization and airway challenge, and prior to challenge with MCh. Bronchoconstriction in response to challenge with increasing doses of MCh was assessed using whole body plethysmography (Penh; Buxco). The amount of eosinophil infiltrate into the bronchoaveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was also determined as a measure of lung inflammation. The effects of GSNOR inhibitors were compared to vehicles and to Combivent (inhaled; IH) as the positive control.
Materials and Method
Allergen Sensitization and Challenge Protocol
OVA (500 ฮผg/ml) in PBS was mixed with equal volumes of 10% (w/v) aluminum potassium sulfate in distilled water and incubated for 60 min. at room temperature after adjustment to pH 6.5 using 10 N NaOH. After centrifugation at 750รg for 5 min, the OVA/alum pellet was resuspended to the original volume in distilled water. Mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 100 ฮผg OVA (0.2 mL of 500 ฮผg/mL in normal saline) complexed with alum on day 0. Mice were anesthetized by IP injection of a 0.2-mL mixture of ketamine and xylazine (0.44 and 6.3 mg/mL, respectively) in normal saline and were placed on a board in the supine position. Two hundred fifty micrograms (100 ฮผl of a 2.5 mg/ml) of OVA (on day 8) and 125 ฮผg (50 ฮผl of 2.5 mg/ml) OVA (on days 15, 18, and 21) were placed on the back of the tongue of each animal.
Pulmonary Function Testing (Penh)
In vivo airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured 24 h after the last OVA challenge in conscious, freely moving, spontaneously breathing mice with whole body plethysmography using a Buxco chamber (Wilmington, N.C.). Mice were challenged with aerosolized saline or increasing doses of methacholine (5, 20, and 50 mg/mL) generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer for 2 min. The degree of bronchoconstriction was expressed as enhanced pause (Penh), a calculated dimensionless value, which correlates with the measurement of airway resistance, impedance, and intrapleural pressure in the same mouse. Penh readings were taken and averaged for 4 min. after each nebulization challenge. Penh is calculated as follows: Penh=[(Te/Trโ1)ร(PEF/PIF)], where Te is expiration time, Tr is relaxation time, PEF is peak expiratory flow, and PIF is peak inspiratory flowร0.67 coefficient. The time for the box pressure to change from a maximum to a user-defined percentage of the maximum represents the relaxation time. The Tr measurement begins at the maximum box pressure and ends at 40%.
Eosinophil Infiltrate in BALF
After measurement of airway hyper-reactivity, the mice were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture, and then BALF was collected from either both lungs or from the right lung after tying off the left lung at the mainstem bronchus. Total BALF cells were counted from a 0.05 mL aliquot, and the remaining fluid was centrifuged at 200รg for 10 min at 4ยฐ C. Cell pellets were resuspended in saline containing 10% BSA with smears made on glass slides. Eosinophils were stained for 5 min. with 0.05% aqueous eosin and 5% acetone in distilled water, rinsed with distilled water, and counterstained with 0.07% methylene blue. Alternatively, eosinophils and other leukocytes were stained with DiffQuik.
GSNOR Inhibitors and Controls
GSNOR inhibitors were reconstituted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, or 0.5% w/v carboxy methylcellulose at concentrations ranging from 0.00005 to 3 mg/mL. GSNOR inhibitors were administered to mice (10 mL/kg) as a single dose or multiple dose either intravenously (IV) or orally via gavage. Dosing was performed from 30 min. to 72 h prior to MCh challenge. Effects of GSNOR inhibitors were compared to vehicle dosed in the same manner.
Combivent was used as the positive control in all studies. Combivent (Boehringer Ingelheim) was administered to the lung using the inhaler device supplied with the product, but adapted for administration to mice, using a pipet tip. Combivent was administered 48 h, 24 h, and 1 h prior to MCh challenge. Each puff (or dose) of Combivent provides a dose of 18 ฮผg ipatropium bromide (IpBr) and 103 ฮผg albuterol sulfate or approximately 0.9 mg/kg IpBr and 5 mg/kg albuterol.
Statistical Analyses
Area under the curve values for Penh across baseline, saline, and increasing doses of MCh challenge were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (San Diego, Calif.) and expressed as a percent of the respective (IV or orally administered) vehicle control. Statistical differences among treatment groups and the respective vehicle control group within each study were calculated using one-way ANOVA, Dunnetts or Bonferroni post-hoc tests or t-test (JMP 8.0, SAS Institute, Cary, N.C. or Microsoft Excel). A p value of <0.05 among the treatment groups and the respective vehicle control group was considered significantly different.
Results
In the OVA model of asthma, Compound 8 (Example 8) significantly (p<0.05) decreased eosinophil infiltration in BAL by 37% of vehicle control when given via three oral doses of 10 mg/kg at 48 h, 24 h, and 1 h prior to assessment.

In the OVA model of asthma, Compound 27 (Example 27) significantly (p<0.05) decreased eosinophil infiltration in BAL by 23% of vehicle control when given via three oral doses of 10 mg/kg at 48 h, 24 h, and 1 h prior to assessment.
In the OVA model of asthma, Compound 4 (Example 4) significantly (p<0.05) decreased MCh-induced AHR by 19% of vehicle control and decreased eosiinophil infiltration into BALF by 20% of vehicle control when given as a single IV dose of 10 mg/kg at 24 h prior to assessment.

Example 61: Efficacy of GSNOR Inhibitors in Experimental Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
Overview of the Models:
Acute and chronic models of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced IBD in mice were used to explore efficacy of GSNORi against this disease. Acute and chronic DSS-induced IBD are widely used and well characterized models that induce pathological changes in the colon similar to those observed in the human disease. In these models and in human disease, epithelial cells within the crypts of the colon are disrupted, leading to dysfunction of the epithelial barrier and the ensuing tissue inflammation, edema, and ulceration. GSNORi therapy may benefit IBD by restoring s-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) levels, and thus prevent or reverse the epithelial barrier dysfunction.
Acute Prophylactic Model:
Experimental IBD was induced by administration of DSS in the drinking water of male C57Bl/6 mice (N=8 to 10 mice per group) for 6 consecutive days. GSNORi was dosed orally at doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day for 10 days starting two days prior to and continuing two days post DSS exposure. Two days post DSS exposure, the effect of GSNORi was assessed in a blinded fashion via endoscopy and histopathology using a five point scale ranging from a score=0 (normal tissue) through a score=4 (ulcerative tissue damage and marked pathological changes). Levels of circulating cytokines involved in inflammatory pathways were also assessed. The effect of GSNORi was compared to vehicle treated controls. The corticosteroid, prednisolone, was used as the positive control in this study and was administered daily at 3 mg/kg/day via oral dosing. Naรฏve mice (N=5) were also assessed as a normal tissue control.
Chronic Treatment Model:
Experimental IBD was induced by administration of DSS in the drinking water of male C57Bl/6 mice (N=10 to 12 mice per group) for 6 consecutive days. GSNORi was dosed orally at doses of 10 mg/kg/day for 14 days starting one day after cessation of DSS exposure. Efficacy of GSNORi was assessed in a blinded fashion via endoscopy after 7 days and 14 days of GSNORi dosing and via histopathology after 14 days of GSNORi dosing using a five point scale ranging from a score=0 (normal tissue) through a score=4 (ulcerative tissue damage and marked pathological changes). Levels of circulating cytokines involved in inflammatory pathways were also assessed. The effect of GSNORi was compared to vehicle treated controls. The corticosteroid, prednisolone, was used as the positive control in this study and was administered daily at 3 mg/kg/day via oral dosing. Naรฏve mice (N=5) were also assessed as a normal tissue control.
Results:
Compound 3 (Example 3) attenuated colon injury and lowered levels of cytokines involved in inflammatory responses in a mouse model of acute DSS-induced IBD. The percent of mice presenting with severe colon injury scores via endoscopy and histopathology assessments was significantly (p<0.05) decreased by 38% to 88% of vehicle control after oral treatment with Compound 3 at 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg/day for 10 consecutive days using a prophylactic dosing regimen. Compound 3 also restored circulating inflammatory cytokines towards levels observed in untreated naรฏve mice. These effects of Compound 3 were comparable to or greater than those observed for prednisolone.
Compound 8 (Example 8) attenuated colon injury in a mouse model of acute DSS-induced IBD. The percent of mice presenting with severe colon injury scores via endoscopy or histopathology assessments was decreased by 44% or 26%, respectively, of vehicle control after oral treatment with Compound 8 at 10 mg/kg/day for 10 consecutive days using a prophylactic dosing regimen.
Compound 19 (Example 19) attenuated colon injury in a mouse model of acute DSS-induced IBD. The percent of mice presenting with severe colon injury scores via endoscopy assessment was decreased by 31% of vehicle control after oral treatment with Compound 19 at 10 mg/kg/day for 10 consecutive days using a prophylactic dosing regimen.
Compound 13 (Example 13) attenuated colon injury in a mouse model of chronic DSS-induced IBD. The percent of mice presenting with severe colon injury scores via endoscopy or histopathology assessment was significantly (p<0.05) decreased by 52% or 53%, respectively, of vehicle control after oral treatment with Compound 13 at 10 mg/kg/day for up to 14 consecutive days using a treatment dosing regimen.
Example 62: Efficacy of GSNOR Inhibitors in Experimental Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
Short Duration Cigarette Smoke COPD Models
The efficacy of GSNOR inhibitors was assessed in a mouse model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) induced by short duration (4 days or 11 days) of exposure to cigarette smoke. Infiltration of inflammatory cells into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and BALF levels of chemokines involved in inflammation and tissue turnover/repair were measured to assess the influences of GSNOR inhibitors on some of the early events associated with the initiation and progression of COPD.
Overview of the Models:
Efficacy of GSNOR inhibitors against COPD was explored using acute (4 day) and subchronic (11 day) models of cigarette smoke-induced COPD in mice. Exposure of animals to cigarette smoke provides a model of COPD in which injury is induced by the same causative agent as in human disease and in which injury exhibits similarities to the human disease, including airway obstruction, airspace enlargement, and involvement of inflammatory responses in these pathologies. In animal models, changes in lung pathology are only evident after extended (several months) duration of exposure to cigarette smoke, thus making chronic models prohibitive as effective screening tools. More recently, models exploring inflammatory responses after short duration (2 weeks or less) of smoke exposure in mice have been utilized as tools for screening efficacy and mechanisms of action of novel therapeutics against COPD. The key roles of inflammation in the initiation and progression of COPD, make these short duration models relevant for initial tests of efficacy of novel therapeutics.
Acute (4 Day) Smoke Exposure Model:
Female C57Bl/6 mice (N=8 per group) were exposed to cigarette smoke using a whole body exposure chamber. Mice were exposed daily for 4 consecutive days to 4 cycles of smoke from 6 sequential cigarettes (Kentucky 3R4F without filter) with a 30 minute smoke free interval between cycles. GSNOR inhibitors were administered daily via oral dosing at 10 mg/kg/day for 7 days starting 2 days prior to smoke exposure and continuing 1 day post-exposure. The effects of GSNOR inhibitors were assessed by quantitating the numbers of total cells, leukocytes, and leukocytes differentials in the BALF via light microscopy and the levels of BALF chemokines via ELISA at approximately 24 h after the last smoke exposure. The effect of GSNOR inhibitors were compared to vehicle treated controls. The PDE4 inhibitor, roflumilast, was used as the positive control for the study. A group of naรฏve mice (N=8) was exposed to air and used as a negative control for the study.
Subchronic (11 Day) Smoke Exposure Model:
Female C57Bl/6 mice (N=10 per group) were exposed to cigarette smoke generated from Marlboro 100 cigarettes without filters. Exposure times were 25 min. on study day 1, 35 min. on study day 2, and 45 min. on study days 3 to 11. GSNOR inhibitors were administered one hour prior to smoke exposure on each day. GSNOR inhibitors were dosed orally at 1 to 10 mg/kg/day for 11 days. The effects of GSNOR inhibitors were assessed by quantitating the number of total cells, and leukocytes differentials in the BALF via light microscopy at 24 h after the last exposure. The effect of GSNOR inhibitors were compared to vehicle treated controls and expressed as percent inhibition of the cigarette smoke induced increases in BALF cell numbers. Roflumilast was used as the positive control for the study and was dosed at 5 mg/kg/day. A group of naรฏve mice (N=10) was exposed to air and dosed with vehicle as a negative control for the study.
Results:
Compound 3 (Example 3) attenuated the smoke-induced changes in BALF cellular infiltrate and BALF inflammatory chemokines. Compound 3 significantly (p<0.05) decreased total cells, leukocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils in BALF by 66%, 80%, 75%, 84%, and 95%, respectively, compared to vehicle treated controls when dosed orally at 10 mg/kg/day for 7 days in the acute 4 day smoke model. These effects of Compound 3 were comparable to or greater than those observed for roflumilast. Compound 3 also restored BALF chemokines towards levels observed in naรฏve mice. In the subchronic 11 day model, Compound 3 inhibited the smoke-induced increase in total cells (p<0.05), macrophages, neutrophils (p<0.05), eosinophils, and lymphocytes (p<0.05) in BALF by 25%, 24%, 41%, 70%, and 49%, respectively, when dosed orally at 10 mg/kg/day for 11 days. When dosed orally at 5 mg/kg/day, Compound 3 inhibited total cells, macrophages, neutrophils (p<0.05), and lymphocytes (p<0.05) in BALF by 22%, 23%, 29%, and 46%, respectively.
Compound 8 (Example 8) significantly (p<0.05) inhibited the smoke-induced increase in total cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in BAL by 35% to 48%, 24% to 43%, 41% to 70%, and 49 to 65%, respectively, when dosed orally at 1 to 10 mg/kg/day for 11 days in the subchronic 11 day model. There was no dose response of effect with 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day. The effects of Compound 8 were comparable to those of roflumilast.
Compound 13 (Example 13) significantly (p<0.05) inhibited the smoke-induced increase in total cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in BAL by 56%, 53%, 67%, and 60%, respectively, when dosed orally at 1 mg/kg/day for 11 days in the subchronic 11 day model. These effects of Compound 13 were comparable to those of roflumilast.
Compound 27 (Example 27) significantly (p<0.05) inhibited the smoke-induced increase in total cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in BAL by 44%, 41%, 64%, and 46%, respectively, when dosed orally at 1 mg/kg/day for 11 days in the subchronic 11 day model. These effects of Compound 27 were comparable to those of roflumilast.
Example 63: An Exploratory Mouse Study of Acetaminophen Toxicity
S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) inhibition has been previously shown in our hands to ameliorate the negative manifestations of gastrointestinal injury in animal models. As an extension of these observations, the effects of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) or GSNOR inhibitors (GSNORi) on acetaminophen (ACAP) induced liver toxicity can be evaluated in a mouse model of liver injury. Blood samples are collected for liver function assays and tissue samples are collected at the end of the study for histopathologic examination.
Materials and Methods
GSNORi, GSNO, acetaminophen (ACAP, Sigma) Vehicles (ยฝ cc syringes for dosing), Isoflurane, 18 1 cc syringes w/26 g needles for blood collection, 90 serum separator tubes for clinical chemistry.
General Study Design:
Animals (5/group) are acclimated for at least 3 days prior to dosing. On Study Day 1, acetaminophen treatment (300 mg/kg PO) was given a single time=0 to fasted animals. Two hours later, GSNORi (10 mg/kg/dose) or GSNO (5 mg/kg/dose) are intravenously administered to the treatment groups. GSNORi or GSNO are given at 24 and 48 hours-post their initial administration to the treatment groups. Mice are observed for signs of clinical toxicity and blood was collected at 6, 24, and 72 hours post-ACAP administration for liver function tests: Alkaline phosphatase (ALK); Alanine aminotransferase (ALT); Aspartate aminotransferase (AST); Gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and Total bilirubin (TBILI). Livers are collected at 72 hours for histopathologic examination.

Vehicle, GSNO and GSNORi Preparation
The vehicle control article is Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (not containing calcium, potassium, or magnesium) adjusted to pH 7.4. The vehicle components are weighed into a container on a tared balance and brought to volume with purified water (w/v). The 10ร stock solution is mixed using a magnetic stirrer, as necessary. Thereafter, the 10ร stock solution is diluted with deionized water at a ratio of 1:9 (v/v). GSNO is warmed to room temperature before preparation of solutions. Prior to use, the PBS solution is nitrogen sparged. 1 mg/mL GSNO solutions are kept cold (i.e., kept on an ice bath) and protected from light and used within 4 hours of preparation. GSNORi Preparation, the 1 mg/mL concentration is reconstituted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. GSNORi is administered to mice (10 mL/kg) as a single (IV) daily dose. Dosing is performed 2 hours post-ACAP administration and then 26 and 50 hours later. Effects of GSNO or GSNORi are compared to ACAP and saline vehicle dosed in the same manner.
Calculations:
Mean body weights, mean liver organ weights and clinical pathology endpoints (+/โSD) with T-test and ANOVA (alpha=0.05) comparison to vehicle control group. The clinical pathology data are prepared as mean values unless the data are not normally distributed, in which case, median values can be presented with the minimum and maximum value range.
Example 64: An Exploratory Study to Assess the Anti NASH Fibrotic Activity of GSNORi in STAM Mice
S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) inhibition has been previously shown in our hands to ameliorate the negative manifestations of gastrointestinal injury and ACAP injury in mouse models. As an extension of these observations, the effects of GSNOR inhibitors (GSNORi) ability to reverse fibrotic activity in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-induced liver disease is evaluated in STAM (signal transducing adaptor molecule) mice. In these mice sequential changes are seen from liver steatosis to fibrosis within two weeks and there are close similarities to human NASH histopathology.
Materials and Methods
GSNORi, Telmisartan, Vehicles (ยฝ cc syringes for dosing), Isoflurane, 18 1 cc syringes w/26 g needles for blood collection, 90 serum separator tubes for clinical chemistry.
General Study Design:
