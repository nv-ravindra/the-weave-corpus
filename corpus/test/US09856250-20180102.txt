FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a substituted tropane derivative having antagonistic activity against T-type calcium channels, and a pharmaceutical agent containing the same.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Intracellular calcium is an important factor which induces various physiological responses such as neuronal excitement, muscle contraction, hormone secretion, fertilization, immune response, cell motility, and cell death. The concentration of intracellular calcium is regulated by means of ion channels or pumps, such as voltage-dependent calcium channels and receptor-operated calcium channels. Voltage-dependent calcium channel is a calcium channel that is opened and closed depending on the change in the potential difference between inside and outside of a cell, and exist on the cellular membranes of muscle cells or nerve cells. The voltage-dependent calcium channels are currently classified into L-type, T-type, N-type, P/Q-type and R-type calcium channels, based on electrophysiological characteristics and pharmacological characteristics. Unlike the L-type, N-type, P/Q-type and R-type calcium channels that are classified as medium potential- and high potential-activated calcium channels in view of the membrane potential activation threshold, the T-type calcium channels are activated at a potential close to the resting membrane potential. Therefore, the T-type calcium channels are considered to function as a trigger for an influx of calcium into the cell, and to participate in the pacemaker activity, production of low-threshold calcium spikes, and burst firing.
T-type calcium channels include three subtypes, i.e. Cav3.1 (α1G), Cav3.2 (α1H) and Cav3.3 (α1I), and expression of the channels in, for example, the brain, nerve tissues, heart, kidneys, liver, pancreas, smooth muscles and testicles, has been reported. It has been suggested that T-type calcium channels are responsible for physiological functions such as the pacemaker function of the heart, renovascular tonus, hormone secretion, nerve firing and pain transmission, and activation of the T-type calcium channels relates to the onset and progress of various pathological conditions such as hypertension, tachyarrhythmia including atrial fibrillation, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac failure, renal dysfunction, pain, epilepsy, sleep disorder, obesity, and cancers. Therefore, T-type calcium channel antagonist is believed to be an effective drug for the treatment or prevention of these diseases (Non Patent Documents 1 to 16).
Known examples of the T-type calcium channel antagonists include efonidipine and mibefradil, as well as 3,4-dihydroquinazoline derivatives disclosed in Patent Document 1, quinazoline derivatives disclosed in Patent Document 2, pyridylamide derivatives disclosed in Patent Document 3, indole derivatives disclosed in Patent Document 4, thiazole derivatives disclosed in Patent Documents 5 and 6, aisoxazole derivatives disclosed in Patent Document 7, and imidazopyridine derivatives disclosed in Patent Document 8.

N-[(exo)-8-(tert-Butylcarbamoyl)methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-yl]methyl-5-chloro-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-carboxamide
The compound of Example 35 (50 mg) was dissolved in acetonitrile (1 mL), and cesium carbonate (95 mg) and methyl iodide (13 μL) were added thereto. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at room temperature. Water was added to the reaction solution, extracted with ethyl acetate, and then the organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. A residue thus obtained was purified by silica gel column chromatography (NH silica gel, 5% to 40% ethyl acetate/hexane), and thus the title compound (40 mg) was obtained.

The compound of Reference Example 5 (150 mg) was dissolved in acetonitrile (2 mL), and 2,3-diaminotoluene (60 mg) and PyBOP (269 mg) were added thereto. Subsequently, triethylamine (262 μL) was added to the mixture, and the mixture was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. The reaction solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, water was added to the residue, and extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. A residue thus obtained was purified by silica gel column chromatography (0% to 15% methanol/chloroform), and thus a crude product was obtained.
The crude product thus obtained was dissolved in acetic acid (2 mL), and the solution was stirred for 4 hours under heating at 80° C. The reaction solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added to the residue, and the mixture was washed with chloroform. A 10% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was added to the aqueous layer to adjust the aqueous layer to pH 10 to 11, and extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and then was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. A residue thus obtained was purified by silica gel column chromatography (0% to 10% methanol/chloroform), and thus the title compound (118 mg) was obtained.

Test Example 1
For representative compounds of the present invention, the antagonistic activity against T-type calcium channels (Cav3.2) was examined by the Test Examples described below. For the respective tests, human embryo kidney cells (HEK293 cells) in which human T-type calcium channels (human Cav3.2) were stably expressed were used.
The HEK293 cells having human Cav3.2 stably expressed therein were cultured at 37° C. in Alpha-MEM, to which 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and G418 (250 g/mL) had been added. The cells were suspended in the culture liquid and were inoculated onto a 96-well plate. Subsequently, the cells were cultured for 48 hours. The culture liquid was removed, and the liquid was changed to S-MEM, to which 5% (v/v) FBS, calcium chloride (0.5 mmol/L), L-glutamine (2 mmol/L), L-alanine (8.9 ng/mL), L-asparagine (13.2 ng/mL), L-aspartic acid (1.33 ng/mL), L-glutamic acid (14.7 ng/mL), glycine (7.5 ng/mL), L-proline (11.5 ng/mL, L-serine (10.5 ng/mL), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) had been added. The cells were cultured for another 24 hours. The culture liquid was removed again, and the cells were washed with an assay buffer (140 mmol/L sodium chloride, 5 mmol/L potassium chloride, 0.5 mmol/L magnesium chloride, 0.5 mmol/L calcium chloride, 10 mmol/L glucose, 0.4 mmol/L magnesium sulfate, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 250 mol/L sulfinpyrazone, pH 7.4) that had been kept warm at 37° C. Subsequently, an assay buffer prepared by dissolving Fura2-AM, which is a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, to a concentration of 5 μM, was added to the cells, and the system was incubated for 30 minutes at 37° C. The assay buffer having Fura2 dissolved therein was removed, and the cells were washed with the assay buffer. Subsequently, an assay buffer prepared by adding a test compound was added to the cells, and the system was incubated for 15 minutes. The plate was mounted on a fluorescence analyzer (FLEX STATION II, Molecular Devices, LLC), and the baseline was measured for 20 seconds. Subsequently, any change in the intracellular calcium concentration that was induced when an assay buffer prepared by adding 100 mmol/L calcium chloride was added to the cells, was measured (excited at 340 nm or 380 nm, and detected at 510 nm). The fluorescence intensity ratios obtainable at the respective wavelengths were calculated.
Meanwhile, the test compound solution was prepared by dissolving each test compound in DMSO to a concentration of 10 mmol/L, and then adjusting the concentration with the assay buffer so as to obtain the set concentration. For the control solution, DMSO was used instead of a test compound.
The inhibitory activity level (%) of a test compound was calculated by subtracting the average value of the fluorescence intensity ratio for a period of 0 to 20 seconds after initiation of measurement, from the average value of the fluorescence intensity ratio for a period of 45 to 50 seconds after initiation of measurement, taking the value obtained using the control solution as the maximum activity of Cav3.2, and comparing this value with the activity in the presence of the test compound.
Calculation of IC50 Value:
The inhibitory activity of each test compound was measured at concentrations of 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10, and 30 mol/L, and the IC50 value was calculated using the curve fitting formula (Model 08: sigmoidal inhibition curve) of ASSAY EXPLORER (Symyx Technologies, Inc.).

The compounds of the present invention are highly safe in terms of, for example, genotoxicity risk, compared to those antagonists for T-type calcium channels having a piperidine structure. This will be shown by the Test Example described below.
Test Example 2
Reverse Mutation Test (Ames Test)
The presence or absence of genotoxicity in the compounds of the present invention was evaluated by a reverse mutation test (Ames test) using bacteria. The test was performed by a pre-incubation method using two bacterial strains of Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100, in the absence of a metabolic activation system (S9mix (−)) and in the presence of a metabolic activation system (S9mix (+)). The compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and thus test liquids were prepared. Regarding the negative control, the solvent DMSO was used. Regarding the positive control, 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (AF-2) was used for S9mix (−), and 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) was used for S9mix (+).
0.1 mL of a test liquid was introduced into a sterilized test tube, and then 0.5 mL of a 0.1 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) was added to the test tube in the case of S9mix (−), or 0.5 mL of rat liver S9mix was added to the test tube in the case of S9mix (+). Furthermore, 0.1 mL of a precultured test strain suspension was added to the test tube, and then the test strain was subjected to shaking culture for 20 minutes at 37° C. (preincubation). After completion of the preincubation, 2 mL of TOP AGAR (soft agar containing histidine and biotin respectively at a concentration of 0.05 mM) was added thereto, and the content was mixed such that foaming did not occur. Subsequently, the content of the test tube was superposed on a minimum glucose agar medium plate and was spread evenly. The plate was cultured for 48 hours at 37° C. in a thermostat. After completion of culture, the number of reverse mutation colonies grown on the plate was measured using a colony counter. Regarding the determination, a case in which the number of reverse mutation colonies increased to twice or more of the number of colonies of the negative control, and concentration-dependency was recognized, was regarded as positive.
For comparison, Control compounds 1 to 3 having a piperidine structure were synthesized by the method described below, and the compounds were similarly evaluated by a genotoxicity test.
wherein R4 and R5 respectively mean the same as defined above.

[1-(tert-Butylcarbamoyl)methylpiperidin-4-yl]acetic acid hydrochloride (1.50 g) was suspended in acetonitrile (20 mL), and 2,3-diaminotoluene (657 mg) and PyBOP (2.93 g) were added thereto. Subsequently, triethylamine (3.03 mL) was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred for 5 hours at room temperature. The reaction solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, water was added thereto, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and then was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. A residue thus obtained was purified by silica gel column chromatography (0% to 10% methanol/ethyl acetate), and a crude product was obtained.
The crude product thus obtained was dissolved in acetic acid (14 mL), and the solution was stirred for 4 hours under heating at 80° C. The reaction solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added to the residue, and the mixture was washed with chloroform. Subsequently, the aqueous layer was adjusted to pH 10 to 11 with a 2 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, and extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and then was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. A residue thus obtained was purified by silica gel column chromatography (0% to 11% methanol/chloroform), to yield the title compound (1.25 g).
