Ghrelin 0-acyl transferase inhibitors
The present invention provides novel GOAT inhibitors and their salts and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.
description="Brief Summary" end="lead"
The present invention relates to compounds useful for inhibiting ghrelin O-acyl transferase (GOAT), pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating diseases related to GOAT activity.
GOAT belongs to the membrane-bound O-acyl transferase (MBOAT) family of enzymes. It converts desacyl-ghrelin (also known as unacylated ghrelin or UAG) to a biologically active form, acyl-ghrelin (AG), by transferring a fatty acid to the Ser3 residue of the desacylghrelin peptide. Acyl-ghrelin has been shown to increase food intake and increase adiposity in humans and in rodents. Infusion of AG in humans has also been shown to suppress glucose-induced insulin secretion. Elimination of the ghrelin gene has been shown to enhance insulin release to prevent or ameliorate glucose intolerance in high-fat diet fed ob/ob mice.
Small molecule GOAT inhibitors have been reported in the literature. See WO 2013/125732.
However, the prevalence of obesity and diabetes coupled with the variable effectiveness and responses to current treatments for obesity and diabetes necessitate that more treatment choices be available to patients. The present invention provides certain novel compounds that are GOAT inhibitors. Such new compounds could address the need for potent, effective treatment of obesity. It is further believed that a GOAT inhibitor may also be useful in reducing weight gain or weight regain as an adjunct to diet and/or exercise, other therapeutic medicinal agents or procedures designed to reducing weight gain or treat obesity. Similarly, a GOAT inhibitor may be useful in treating type 2 diabetes, singly or in combination with other treatments for type 2 diabetes.

The present invention also encompasses intermediates and processes useful for the synthesis of a compound of the present invention.
The term “treating” (or “treat” or “treatment”) as used herein refers to restraining, slowing, stopping, or reversing the progression or severity of an existing symptom, condition or disorder.
As used herein, the term “reducing weight gain” refers to diminishing the increase in weight of a patient. The term “reducing weight regain” refers to diminishing the increase in weight of a patient experiencing rebound in weight after weight loss. Weight regain may be due to a rebound effect following cessation of weight loss achieved via diet, exercise, behavior modification, or approved therapies. For avoidance of doubt weight gain or weight regain as used herein refers to weight gain or weight regain induced by food intake or eating habits and does not refer to non-food related weight gain such as build up of fluids, weight due to water retention, muscle mass, or inflammation.
An “ischemic event” as used herein refers to an insufficient supply of blood to an organ or body part. The decrease in blood flow reduces the supply of oxygen to the affected organ or body part. An ischemic event may also be known as ischemia. One skilled in the art will know that ischemia can affect different organs or parts of the body, for example the heart, such as myocardial ischemia or cardiac ischemia, or the brain, such as cerebral ischemia.
“Addiction disorders” as used herein describes excessive maladaptive behaviors for which an individual exhibits an inability to control despite negative consequences. Of particular relevance to the present invention are addiction disorders involving consummatory behaviors such as alcohol intake, smoking, overeating, and use of illicit drugs. This invention normalizes aberrant incentive and reward neural substrates that are dysregulated in individuals with addictive disorders. Stress is often a precipitating agent in the etiology and maintenance of addictive disorders; this invention provides a method to ameliorate the consequences of stress that promote addictive behaviors.

Additives such as DMAP may be used to enhance the reaction. Alternatively, compound (5a-c) can be acylated using substituted acyl chlorides in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine or pyridine.
The amine resulting from deprotection of compound (18) may be reacted with compound (19) under standard amide coupling conditions, including those previously described in the preparation (18), to give a compound of Formula (I). The skilled artisan will recognize that there are alternative methods to prepare a compound of Formula (I) from deprotected compound (18), including reacting with an acid chloride in the presence of an organic base, such as triethylamine, or with an anhydride in the presence of a base and a catalyst, such as DMAP.
In an optional step, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of Formula (I) can be formed by reaction of an appropriate free base of Formula (I) with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable acid in a suitable solvent under standard conditions.

Assays
GOAT is the principal enzyme that converts UAG to AG. For reviews of the role of GOAT and ghrelin see: Kristy M. Heppner et al, The ghrelin O-acyltransferase-ghrelin system: a novel regulator of glucose metabolism, Current Opinion in Endocrinology, Diabetes & Obesity 2011, 18:50-55; Phillip A. Cole et al., Glucose and Weight Control in Mice with a Designed Ghrelin OAcyltransferase Inhibitor, Science. 2010 Dec. 17; 330(6011): 1689-1692. doi:10.1126/science.1196154, Matthias H. Tschöp et al., Gastric O-acyl transferase activates hunger signal to the brain, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2008 Apr. 29; 105(17): 6213-6214, and Jesus Gutierrez, et al., Ghrelin octanoylation mediated by an orphan lipid transferase, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA., 2008 Apr. 29, 105 (17): 6320-6325.
The role of GOAT is supported by the phenotypes observed in mice devoid of GOAT gene. Therefore, inhibition of GOAT is expected to decrease circulating AG and raise circulating UAG. Consequently, the ratio of AG to total ghrelin (UAG+AG) is reduced after GOAT inhibitor treatment.
In Vitro Cell Free Human GOAT Enzymatic Assay
Human GOAT gene (Accession number: NM_001100916) is subcloned to pAN51 baculoviral expression vector. Baculovirus stock is prepared following the Bac-to-Bac Protocol provided by the vendor, Invitrogen, California, USA. Five mililiters of human GOAT baculoviral stock are added to 500 mL Sf9 cells in HyQ SFX-Insect™ media (HyClone catalog number SH30278.02) at the density of 1×106 cells per milliliter in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask. The flask with human GOAT gene infected Sf9 cells is put on a plate shaker at 120 rpm at 28° C. for 48 h. After 48 h incubation, cells are centrifuged at 1,000×g for 10 min at 4° C. The cell pellets are collected and stored at −80° C. in a freezer until ready for further processing.
Preparation of Microsomal Membrane of GOAT Enzyme for the Enzymatic Assay:
One gram cell pellets are suspended in 9 mL chilled homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM sucrose, adjusted to pH 7.5, and sterile filtered through 0.2 μm Millipore filter). The cell suspension is transferred to a Dounce glass homogenizer. Cell pellets are homogenized with 40 strokes on ice. The homogenate is centrifuged at 3,000 rpm in a Beckman swing bucket rotor at 4° C. for 10 min to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant is collected and centrifuged at 40,000×g for 1 h at 4° C. The resulting membrane pellet is suspended in the homogenization buffer using a Dounce glass homogenizer and stored at −20° C. in the freezer for the assay. For long term storage of the human GOAT enzyme membrane preparation, the suspended membrane is stored in a −80° C. freezer.
Human GOAT Enzymatic Assay Protocol:
Prepare test compounds in DMSO to make up a 0.2 mM stock solution. Serially dilute the stock solution in DMSO for ten concentrations with final compound concentrations ranging from 10 μM to 0.5 nM in a 96-well round-bottom plate. Prepare enzyme and substrate solutions in assay buffer (0.02% TWEEN™-20 in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5 containing 250 mM sucrose, 1 mg/mL BSA and 10 mM EDTA). Add diluted compound (1 μL) to each well of row A to N of a corresponding low protein binding 384 well plate. Add human GOAT substrate mix (10 μL), consisting of human desacyl-ghrelin-biotin (CPC Scientific Inc., 6.0 μM final), octanoyl-CoA (Sigma, 60 μM final) and an AG specific antibody (WO 2006/091381) (1.0 μg/mL final), to the compounds. Add GOAT-His/sf9 enzyme preparation, that has been prepared in assay buffer (9 μL), to each well of the plate containing substrate and test compounds resulting in a final concentration of 0.01 μg/mL to initiate the reaction. Incubate the mixture for 1 h at RT on a gently rotating oscillator. Add 4 M guanidine hydrochloride (20 μL) to all wells, mix, and incubate for 3 h to stop the reaction.
Prepare ELISA plates (STREPTAVIDIN SPECTRAPLATE™ 384, Perkin Elmer) by blocking with 2% Heat-Inactivated FBS in PBS (40 μL) (Invitrogen) blocking buffer for 3 h. Aspirate the blocking buffer from ELISA plate and add blocking buffer (23 μL) to columns 1-24, rows A-N. Reserve rows O and P for the acylghrelin standard curve. Add the reaction mixture (2 μL) to the ELISA plates. Prepare a 10 point standard curve (biotin-labeled octanoyl-ghrelin) by serial 2× dilution in blocking buffer containing 0.2M Guanidine hydrochloride starting at 2.5 μM. Incubate the reaction mixture or biotin-labeled AG standard in the ELISA plate overnight at 4° C. The following day, wash the plate 3× with wash buffer (0.1% TWEEN™-20/PBS, 100 μL per well in each wash cycle). Add AG specific antibody (WO 2006/091381) (25 μL of 0.5 μg/mL in blocking buffer) to each well and incubate at RT for 1 h. Wash the plate 3× with the wash buffer, similarly to the previous step. Add Protein G-HRP (25 μL) (Southern Biotech) diluted 3,000× in blocking buffer and incubate 1 h at RT. Wash the late 3× with wash buffer, as in the previous steps. Add TMB reagent (25 μL) (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.) to each well and let develop for 20 min and stop with 1 M phosphoric acid (25 μL per well). Read plates at 450 nm using an ENVISION® Multilabel plate reader. AG levels are calculated versus a fitted standard curve and percent inhibition calculated. The 10-point inhibition curve is plotted and fitted with the four-parameter logistic equation to obtain IC50 values using ACTIVITYBASE® (ver. 7.3.2.1).
Following a protocol essentially as described above, all of the compounds of the Examples herein were tested and exhibited an IC50 for the in vitro cell free human GOAT enzymatic assay of lower than 1 μM. The following exemplified compounds of the invention were tested essentially as described above and exhibited the following activity as illustrated in Table 3 below.  TABLE 3

The data in Table 3 demonstrate that the compounds of Table 3 inhibit purified GOAT enzyme activity in vitro.
Comparing the change in the ratio of AG to total ghrelin in the compound treated group and that of the vehicle treated group reflects the degree of GOAT enzyme inhibition in vivo, due to the dynamic processing of UAG to AG by the GOAT enzyme. In the in vivo pharmacodynamic studies herein, the levels of AG and UAG in plasma and stomach in the vehicle and compound treated groups are measured by ELISA specifically to these two analytes. The total ghrelin level of each sample is computed as the sum of AG and UAG by these ELISA measurements. The ratio of AG to total ghrelin is defined by the level of AG in each sample divided by the level of total ghrelin in the same sample. The levels of AG, UAG and ratio of AG to total ghrelin in the vehicle treated group is computed and set as 100%. The relative change of these parameters in the compound treated group is then computed to determine the effectiveness of the test compound.
In Vivo Dose Dependent 3 Day BID Study for GOAT Inhibitor
Animals and Treatment:
Purchase male C57BL/6 mice from Harlan (Indianapolis, Ind.) at 9 weeks of age. House the mice individually in a temperature-controlled (24° C.) facility with a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on 2200 h), and allow free access to a standard rodent chow (diet 2014, Harlan) and water. Typically, use the mice when they are 10-13 weeks of age at the time of the study. On day 0 of the experiment, randomize the mice into treatment groups (N=7/group) so each group has similar mean body weights. On day 1 and day 2, treat the animals with vehicle (1% hydroxyethylcellulose, 0.25% TWEEN™ 80, 0.05% antifoam) or test compound prepared in the vehicle as suspension at various dosages by oral gavage at 7 am and 7 pm. On day 3, fast the animals, move them into clean cages and dose with vehicle or the test compound again at 8 am by oral gavage. That same day at 1 pm, sacrifice the animals by decapitation to collect blood. For details of blood collection and plasma treatments see Blood collection and Extraction of Ghrelin from Plasma section below.
Blood Collection:
Collect approximately 600 μL blood into a pre-weighed EDTA tube containing 600 μL (defined as Vpreservative) freshly-prepared preservative (4 mM PEFABLOC® [4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride], 72 mM NaCl, 58 mM NaF, 0.032 N hydrochloric acid, pH 3.0) and mix immediately. Weigh the tube again and keep on ice. To accurately determine the exact blood volume of each sample using this blood collection procedure, the weight of the blood for each mouse is computed using the following equation:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
Weight of Blood=(Weight of the tube containing Blood+preservative)−(Weight of the tube containing preservative)
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
Blood volume(Vblood)=(Weight of blood)/1.06
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
Note, the density of rodent blood is assumed as 1.06 g/mL.
Within 15 minutes after the blood collection, samples are centrifuged at 5000 rpm at 4° C. for 8 min. Remove plasma (650 μL) to a 5 mL glass tube containing 1 N hydrochloric acid (65 μL), mix and keep on ice.
Ghrelin Extraction by SEP-PAK® Column:
AG and UAG are extracted from plasma using SEP-PAK® C18 column to remove interference prior to performing the ELISA. The solid phase extraction of AG and UAG peptides by SEP-PAK® C18 columns can be performed on a vacuum manifold (Waters Corp) or using a peristaltic pump. The sample SEP-PAK® column extraction procedure is independently applied to the plasma sample obtained from each individual mouse. The general extraction protocol is described as follows.
All solutions used for the entire protocol of the SEP-PAK® column extraction should be at ice cold condition. Wet SEP-PAK®_columns (WAT054960, Waters Corp, Milford Mass.) with 99.9% ACN/0.1% TFA (1 mL of solution of 100 mL ACN/0.1 mL TFA). Apply pressure to adjust the flow-rate to about 1 ml/min to remove liquid from the column bed but do not allow the column to dry out at any point. Once liquid is removed from the column, stop the pressure. Equilibrate the columns with 3% ACN/0.1% TFA (1 mL of 97 mL water, 3 mL ACN, 0.1 mL TFA). Apply pressure to adjust the flow-rate to about 1 mL/min to remove liquid from the column bed, but do not let the column dry out. Dilute approximately 650 μL acidified plasma (defined as Vplasma added to column) to 1.4 mL ice cold 0.1% TFA. Load all diluted acidified plasma from the previous step onto the columns. Apply pressure to adjust the flow-rate to about 0.5 mL/min to allow sample passing through the column and ghrelin peptides to absorb onto the resin of the column. Do not let the column dry out. Wash with 3% ACN/0.1% TFA (0.9 mL of 97 mL water, 3 mL ACN, 0.1 mL TFA). Apply pressure to adjust the flow-rate to about 1 mL/min to remove liquid from the column bed but do not let the column dry out. Repeat the wash two more times. Elute with 60% ACN/0.1% TFA (1 mL of 40 mL water, 60 mL ACN, 0.1 mL TFA). Put a collection tube underneath of each column, apply pressure to adjust the flow-rate to about 0.5 mL/min to push liquid through the column and collect the eluent into the collection tube. Freeze the samples on dry ice immediately. Lyophilize the samples in a speed-vacuum (Model# SC110A, Savant) and store at −20° C. until the ELISA assay is performed.
ELISA Assay for Ghrelin:
Coat 96-well MULTI-ARRAY® MSD® plates (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersberg, Md., Catalog # L15XA-3) with 100 μL of 1 μg/mL of an antibody (WO 2005/026211 AND WO2006/019577) that recognizes the mid-domain of both the acyl and unacylated forms of ghrelin in PBS (Invitrogen). Tap the sides of the plates to ensure coverage of wells, seal with adhesive plate sealer, and incubate overnight at RT. Discard the contents and add BLOCKER™ Casein in PBS (100 μL) (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill., Catalog #37528) to each well. Reseal the plates and put on a plate shaker at RT for 1 h.
Reconstitute the lyophilized preserved plasma samples from the SEP-PAK® C18 column extraction in BLOCKER™ Casein in PBS (400 μL to each sample, this volume is defined as Vreconstitution), mix well with a vortex mixer and incubate on ice for 45-60 min. Discard the contents from the plates and add reconstituted plasma samples at 25 μL to each well. Prepare acylghrelin and unacylated ghrelin standard curves beginning with 8000 μg/mL and performing serial 1:4 dilutions for 8 total concentrations. Add the prepared standards in duplicate to the blocked plates with 25 μL in each well. Seal the plates and incubate at RT on a plate shaker for 2 h.
Discard the plate contents and wash three times with PBS including 0.1% TWEEN™ 20 (150 μL) (PBS-T). Acylghrelin specific antibody (WO 2006/091381) or unacylated ghrelin specific antibody (WO 2006/055347) labeled with MSD® SULFO-TAG™ (Meso Scale Discovery) are diluted to 0.05 μg/mL in 0.2× Blocker Casein containing 0.05% TWEEN™ 20, named secondary antibody solution. Remove the final wash and add secondary antibody solution (25 μL to each well) which specifically recognizes AG or UAG. The plates are resealed and incubated for 1 h at RT on a plate shaker before finally washing 3× again with PBS-T (150 μL/well).
Discard the final wash and replace with 1×MSD® Read Buffer (150 μL/well). Read the electrochemiluminescent signal generated by activation of the bound MSD® SULFO-TAG™ label to the electrodes on the plates using the MSD® SECTOR® Imager 6000 analyzer (Meso Scale Discovery). Calculate concentrations of acylghrelin or unacylated ghrelin based on the respective standard curve generated by the MSD® software. Determine the actual plasma concentration for each sample by multiplying the measured acylghrelin or unacylated ghrelin level by a dilution factor. The dilution factor for each plasma sample is computed with the following equation.
