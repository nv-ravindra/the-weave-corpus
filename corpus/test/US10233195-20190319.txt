BACKGROUND
Field
Pyridinone compounds, method of making such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and medicaments comprising such compounds, and methods of using such compounds to treat, prevent or diagnose diseases, disorders, or conditions associated with fibrosis are provided.
Description
Fibrosis is the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue in a reparative or reactive process. Examples of fibrosis include, but are not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, dermal fibrosis, and renal fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis, also called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), interstitial diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis, or fibrosing alveolitis, is a lung disorder and a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by abnormal formation of fibrous tissue between alveoli caused by alveolitis comprising cellular infiltration into the alveolar septae with resulting fibrosis. The effects of IPF are chronic, progressive, and often fatal.
There continues to be a need for safe and effective drugs to treat fibrotic conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Wherever a group is described as “optionally substituted” that group can be substituted with the above substituents.
It is to be understood that certain radical naming conventions can include either a mono-radical or a di-radical, depending on the context. For example, where a substituent requires two points of attachment to the rest of the molecule, it is understood that the substituent is a di-radical. For example, a substituent identified as alkyl that requires two points of attachment includes di-radicals such as —CH2—, —CH2CH2—, —CH2CH(CH3)CH2—, and the like. Other radical naming conventions clearly indicate that the radical is a di-radical such as “alkylene” or “alkenylene.”
When two R groups are said to form a ring (e.g., a carbocyclyl, heterocyclyl, aryl, or heteroaryl ring) “together with the atom to which they are attached,” it is meant that the collective unit of the atom and the two R groups are the recited ring. The ring is not otherwise limited by the definition of each R group when taken individually. For example, when the following substructure is present: and R1 and R2 are defined as selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl, or R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a heterocyclyl, it is meant that R1 and R2 can be selected from hydrogen or alkyl, or alternatively, the substructure has structure: where ring A is a heteroaryl ring containing the depicted nitrogen.
Similarly, when two “adjacent” R groups are said to form a ring “together with the atom to which they are attached,” it is meant that the collective unit of the atoms, intervening bonds, and the two R groups are the recited ring. For example, when the following substructure is present: and R1 and R2 are defined as selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl, or R1 and R2 together with the atoms to which they are attached form an aryl or carbocyclyl, it is meant that R1 and R2 can be selected from hydrogen or alkyl, or alternatively, the substructure has structure: where A is an aryl ring or a carbocyclyl containing the depicted double bond.
Wherever a substituent is depicted as a di-radical (i.e., has two points of attachment to the rest of the molecule), it is to be understood that the substituent can be attached in any directional configuration unless otherwise indicated. Thus, for example, a substituent depicted as -AE- or includes the substituent being oriented such that the A is attached at the leftmost attachment point of the molecule as well as the case in which A is attached at the rightmost attachment point of the molecule.
As used herein, “isosteres” of a chemical group are other chemical groups that exhibit the same or similar properties. For example, tetrazole is an isostere of carboxylic acid because it mimics the properties of carboxylic acid even though they both have very different molecular formulae. Tetrazole is one of many possible isosteric replacements for carboxylic acid. Other carboxylic acid isosteres contemplated include —SO3H, —SO2HNR, —PO2(R)2, —PO3(R)2, —CONHNHSO2R, —COHNSO2R, and —CONRCN, where R is selected from hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl, C2-6 alkenyl, C2-6 alkynyl, C3-7 carbocyclyl, C6-10 aryl, 5-10 membered heteroaryl, and 5-10 membered heterocyclyl, as defined herein. In addition, carboxylic acid isosteres can include 5-7 membered carbocycles or heterocycles containing any combination of CH2, O, S, or N in any chemically stable oxidation state, where any of the atoms of said ring structure are optionally substituted in one or more positions. The following structures are non-limiting examples of carbocyclic and heterocyclic isosteres contemplated. The atoms of said ring structure may be optionally substituted at one or more positions with R as defined above.
It is also contemplated that when chemical substitutes are added to a carboxylic isostere, the compound retains the properties of a carboxylic isostere. It is contemplated that when a carboxylic isostere is optionally substituted with one or more moieties selected from R as defined above, then the substitution and substitution position is selected such that it does not eliminate the carboxylic acid isosteric properties of the compound. Similarly, it is also contemplated that the placement of one or more R substituents upon a carbocyclic or heterocyclic carboxylic acid isostere is not a substitution at one or more atom(s) that maintain(s) or is/are integral to the carboxylic acid isosteric properties of the compound, if such substituent(s) would destroy the carboxylic acid isosteric properties of the compound.
Other carboxylic acid isosteres not specifically exemplified in this specification are also contemplated.
“Subject” as used herein, means a human or a non-human mammal, e.g., a dog, a cat, a mouse, a rat, a cow, a sheep, a pig, a goat, a non-human primate or a bird, e.g., a chicken, as well as any other vertebrate or invertebrate.
The term “mammal” is used in its usual biological sense. Thus, it specifically includes, but is not limited to, primates, including simians (chimpanzees, apes, monkeys) and humans, cattle, horses, sheep, goats, swine, rabbits, dogs, cats, rodents, rats, mice guinea pigs, or the like.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” or “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. In addition, various adjuvants such as are commonly used in the art may be included. Considerations for the inclusion of various components in pharmaceutical compositions are described, e.g., in Gilman et al. (Eds.) (1990); Goodman and Gilman's: The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8th Ed., Pergamon Press.
A therapeutic effect relieves, to some extent, one or more of the symptoms of a disease or condition, and includes curing a disease or condition. “Curing” means that the symptoms of a disease or condition are eliminated; however, certain long-term or permanent effects may exist even after a cure is obtained (such as extensive tissue damage).
“Treat,” “treatment,” or “treating,” as used herein refers to administering a compound or pharmaceutical composition to a subject for prophylactic and/or therapeutic purposes. The term “prophylactic treatment” refers to treating a subject who does not yet exhibit symptoms of a disease or condition, but who is susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of, a particular disease or condition, whereby the treatment reduces the likelihood that the patient will develop the disease or condition. The term “therapeutic treatment” refers to administering treatment to a subject already suffering from a disease or condition.
Where the compounds disclosed herein have at least one chiral center, they may exist as individual enantiomers and diastereomers or as mixtures of such isomers, including racemates. Separation of the individual isomers or selective synthesis of the individual isomers is accomplished by application of various methods which are well known to practitioners in the art. Unless otherwise indicated, all such isomers and mixtures thereof are included in the scope of the compounds disclosed herein. Furthermore, compounds disclosed herein may exist in one or more crystalline or amorphous forms. Unless otherwise indicated, all such forms are included in the scope of the compounds disclosed herein including any polymorphic forms. In addition, some of the compounds disclosed herein may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents. Unless otherwise indicated, such solvates are included in the scope of the compounds disclosed herein.
The skilled artisan will recognize that some structures described herein may be resonance forms or tautomers of compounds that may be fairly represented by other chemical structures, even when kinetically; the artisan recognizes that such structures may only represent a very small portion of a sample of such compound(s). Such compounds are considered within the scope of the structures depicted, though such resonance forms or tautomers are not represented herein.
Isotopes may be present in the compounds described. Each chemical element as represented in a compound structure may include any isotope of said element. For example, in a compound structure a hydrogen atom may be explicitly disclosed or understood to be present in the compound. At any position of the compound that a hydrogen atom may be present, the hydrogen atom can be any isotope of hydrogen, including but not limited to hydrogen-1 (protium) and hydrogen-2 (deuterium). Thus, reference herein to a compound encompasses all potential isotopic forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions
Some embodiments include pharmaceutical compositions comprising: (a) a safe and therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein (including enantiomers, diastereoisomers, tautomers, polymorphs, and solvates thereof), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, excipient or combination thereof.
The compounds are administered at a therapeutically effective dosage, e.g., a dosage sufficient to provide treatment for the disease states previously described. While human dosage levels have yet to be optimized for the compounds of the preferred embodiments, generally, a daily dose for most of the compounds described herein is from about 0.25 mg/kg to about 120 mg/kg or more of body weight, from about 0.5 mg/kg or less to about 70 mg/kg, from about 1.0 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight, or from about 1.5 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body weight. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be from about 17 mg per day to about 8000 mg per day, from about 35 mg per day or less to about 7000 mg per day or more, from about 70 mg per day to about 6000 mg per day, from about 100 mg per day to about 5000 mg per day, or from about 200 mg to about 3000 mg per day. The amount of active compound administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject and disease state being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner and schedule of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician.
Administration of the compounds disclosed herein or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be via any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities including, but not limited to, orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally, topically, transdermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonarily, vaginally, rectally, or intraocularly. Oral and parenteral administrations are customary in treating the indications that are the subject of the preferred embodiments.
The compounds useful as described above can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions for use in treatment of these conditions. Standard pharmaceutical formulation techniques are used, such as those disclosed in Remington's The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (2005), incorporated by reference in its entirety.
In addition to the selected compound useful as described above, come embodiments include compositions containing a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The term “pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier”, as used herein, means one or more compatible solid or liquid filler diluents or encapsulating substances, which are suitable for administration to a mammal. The term “compatible”, as used herein, means that the components of the composition are capable of being commingled with the subject compound, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction, which would substantially reduce the pharmaceutical efficacy of the composition under ordinary use situations. Pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers must, of course, be of sufficiently high purity and sufficiently low toxicity to render them suitable for administration preferably to an animal, preferably mammal being treated.
Some examples of substances, which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers or components thereof, are sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, and methyl cellulose; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; solid lubricants, such as stearic acid and magnesium stearate; calcium sulfate; vegetable oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil of theobroma; polyols such as propylene glycol, glycerine, sorbitol, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol; alginic acid; emulsifiers, such as the TWEENS; wetting agents, such sodium lauryl sulfate; coloring agents; flavoring agents; tableting agents, stabilizers; antioxidants; preservatives; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; and phosphate buffer solutions.
The choice of a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier to be used in conjunction with the subject compound is basically determined by the way the compound is to be administered.
The compositions described herein are preferably provided in unit dosage form. As used herein, a “unit dosage form” is a composition containing an amount of a compound that is suitable for administration to an animal, preferably mammal subject, in a single dose, according to good medical practice. The preparation of a single or unit dosage form however, does not imply that the dosage form is administered once per day or once per course of therapy. Such dosage forms are contemplated to be administered once, twice, thrice or more per day and may be administered as infusion over a period of time (e.g., from about 30 minutes to about 2-6 hours), or administered as a continuous infusion, and may be given more than once during a course of therapy, though a single administration is not specifically excluded. The skilled artisan will recognize that the formulation does not specifically contemplate the entire course of therapy and such decisions are left for those skilled in the art of treatment rather than formulation.
The compositions useful as described above may be in any of a variety of suitable forms for a variety of routes for administration, for example, for oral, nasal, rectal, topical (including transdermal), ocular, intracerebral, intracranial, intrathecal, intra-arterial, intravenous, intramuscular, or other parental routes of administration. The skilled artisan will appreciate that oral and nasal compositions include compositions that are administered by inhalation, and made using available methodologies. Depending upon the particular route of administration desired, a variety of pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers well-known in the art may be used. Pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include, for example, solid or liquid fillers, diluents, hydrotropies, surface-active agents, and encapsulating substances. Optional pharmaceutically-active materials may be included, which do not substantially interfere with the inhibitory activity of the compound. The amount of carrier employed in conjunction with the compound is sufficient to provide a practical quantity of material for administration per unit dose of the compound. Techniques and compositions for making dosage forms useful in the methods described herein are described in the following references, all incorporated by reference herein: Modern Pharmaceutics, 4th Ed., Chapters 9 and 10 (Banker & Rhodes, editors, 2002); Lieberman et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets (1989); and Ansel, Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms 8th Edition (2004).
Various oral dosage forms can be used, including such solid forms as tablets, capsules, granules and bulk powders. Tablets can be compressed, tablet triturates, enteric-coated, sugar-coated, film-coated, or multiple-compressed, containing suitable binders, lubricants, diluents, disintegrating agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, flow-inducing agents, and melting agents. Liquid oral dosage forms include aqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules, and effervescent preparations reconstituted from effervescent granules, containing suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, diluents, sweeteners, melting agents, coloring agents and flavoring agents.
The pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers suitable for the preparation of unit dosage forms for peroral administration is well-known in the art. Tablets typically comprise conventional pharmaceutically-compatible adjuvants as inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, mannitol, lactose and cellulose; binders such as starch, gelatin and sucrose; disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and croscarmellose; lubricants such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid and talc. Glidants such as silicon dioxide can be used to improve flow characteristics of the powder mixture. Coloring agents, such as the FD&C dyes, can be added for appearance. Sweeteners and flavoring agents, such as aspartame, saccharin, menthol, peppermint, and fruit flavors, are useful adjuvants for chewable tablets. Capsules typically comprise one or more solid diluents disclosed above. The selection of carrier components depends on secondary considerations like taste, cost, and shelf stability, which are not critical, and can be readily made by a person skilled in the art.
Peroral compositions also include liquid solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and the like. The pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers suitable for preparation of such compositions are well known in the art. Typical components of carriers for syrups, elixirs, emulsions and suspensions include ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, liquid sucrose, sorbitol and water. For a suspension, typical suspending agents include methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, AVICEL RC-591, tragacanth and sodium alginate; typical wetting agents include lecithin and polysorbate 80; and typical preservatives include methyl paraben and sodium benzoate. Peroral liquid compositions may also contain one or more components such as sweeteners, flavoring agents and colorants disclosed above.
Such compositions may also be coated by conventional methods, typically with pH or time-dependent coatings, such that the subject compound is released in the gastrointestinal tract in the vicinity of the desired topical application, or at various times to extend the desired action. Such dosage forms typically include, but are not limited to, one or more of cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, ethyl cellulose, Eudragit coatings, waxes and shellac.
Compositions described herein may optionally include other drug actives.
Inhalable Formulations
In some embodiments, a compound described herein can be prepared in inhalable formulations for administration via an atomizer. An atomizer allows a stream of air to move at a high velocity over the tip of a tube dipped in a solution. The pressure at the tip of the tube is lowered and the solution is drawn into the air flow. The solution disperses into a fine spray or droplets that are carried into the inhaled stream of air.
In some embodiments the inhalable solution formulations described herein are administered with a nebulizer that is placed in the mouth. The spray, mist or fine droplets produced by atomizers or nebulizers allow the compound described herein to reach the bronchioles in the lungs. Various nebulizers suitable for this use include jet nebulizers, ultrasonic nebulizers, and vibrating mesh nebulizers. A jet nebulizer utilizes air pressure breakage of an aqueous solution into aerosol droplets. An ultrasonic nebulizer utilizes shearing of the aqueous solution by a piezoelectric crystal. Vibrating mesh nebulizers rely upon either piezoelectric or mechanical pulses to generate respirable liquid droplets. A vibrating mesh nebulizer consists of a liquid storage container in fluid contact with a diaphragm and inhalation and exhalation valves. Commercial examples of nebulizers that can be used include Respirgard II®, Aeroneb®, Aeroneb® Pro, and Aeroneb® Go produced by Aerogen; AERx® and AERx Essence™ produced by Aradigm; Porta-Neb®, Freeway Freedom™, Sidestream, Ventstream and I-neb produced by Respironics, Inc.; and PARI LC-Plus®, PARI LC-Star®, and e-Flow7m produced by PARI, GmbH.
By non-limiting example, a compound disclosed herein is placed in a liquid nebulization inhaler and prepared in dosages to deliver from about 7 to about 700 mg from a dosing solution of about 1 to about 5 ml, preferably from about 14 to about 350 mg in about 1 to about 5 ml, and most preferably from about 28 to about 280 mg in about 1 to about 5 ml with mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) particles sizes between about 2 to about 5 um being produced.
By non-limiting example, a nebulized compound disclosed herein may be administered in the prescribed respirable delivered dose in less than about 20 min, preferably less than about 10 min, more preferably less than about 7 min, more preferably less than about 5 min, more preferably less than about 3 min, and in some cases most preferable if less than about 2 min.
In some embodiments, the inhalable formulations described herein comprise a propellant and are pressure packaged for administration of a compound described herein using pressurized aerosols. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount.
In some embodiments, the inhalable formulations described herein are administered with a metered dose spray bottle that delivers a specific volume of a solution, suspension, emulsion or colloidal dispersion for inhalation.
In some embodiments, dry powder inhalable formulations are administered with an insufflator. An insufflator consists of a rubber bulb connected to a container and a delivery pipe. As the bulb is squeezed, air is blown into the container and causes the powder to move. The particles are carried out via the delivery tube and are inhaled.
In some embodiments, dry powder inhalable formulations are administered with a puffer. The dry powder is placed in the puffer and the puffer is squeezed. A portion of the powder is ejected from the spout into the air and is inhaled. Capsules and cartridges of, such as, by way of example only, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a dry powder formulation.
In some embodiments, a propellant driven inhaler (pMDI) releases a metered dose of a compound described herein upon each actuation. In such applications, the compound can be formulated as a suspension or solution of a drug substance in a suitable propellant such as a halogenated hydrocarbon. The propellants for use with the MDIs may be any propellants known in the art. Examples of propellants include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, and dichlorotetrafluoroethane; hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs); and carbon dioxide.

Method of Treatment
Some embodiments described herein relate to a method of treating a fibrotic condition, which can include administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound disclosed herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a subject. The methods include identifying a subject at risk for or having a fibrotic condition and administering a compound to the subject in an effective amount for therapeutic treatment or prophylactic treatment of the fibrotic condition. In some embodiments, the compound described herein, the pharmaceutical acceptable salt thereof, or the pharmaceutical composition thereof is administered by inhalation.
A “fibrotic condition,” “fibroproliferative condition,” “fibrotic disease,” “fibroproliferative disease,” “fibrotic disorder,” and “fibroproliferative disorder” are used interchangeably to refer to a condition, disease or disorder that is characterized by dysregulated proliferation or activity of fibroblasts and/or abnormal accumulation of fibronectin and/or pathologic or excessive accumulation of collagenous tissue. Typically, any such disease, disorder or condition is amenable to treatment by administration of a compound having anti-fibrotic activity. Fibrotic disorders include, but are not limited to, pulmonary fibrosis, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pulmonary fibrosis from a known etiology, dermal fibrosis, pancreatic fibrosis, liver fibrosis (e.g., hepatic fibrosis associated with chronic active hepatitis), and renal fibrosis.
In some embodiments, the subject is a human.
The terms “therapeutically effective amount,” as used herein, refer to an amount of a compound sufficient to cure, ameliorate, slow progression of, prevent, or reduce the likelihood of onset of the identified disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic, prophylactic, or inhibitory effect. The effect can be detected by, for example, the assays disclosed in the following examples. The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subject's body weight, size, and health; the nature and extent of the condition; and the therapeutic or combination of therapeutics selected for administration. Therapeutically and prophylactically effective amounts for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation that is within the skill and judgment of the clinician.
For any compound, the therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays, e.g., of neoplastic cells, or in animal models, usually rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans.
Therapeutic/prophylactic efficacy and toxicity may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) and LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio between therapeutic and toxic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio, ED50/LD50. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. However, pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit narrow therapeutic indices are also within the scope of the invention. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies may be used in formulating a range of dosage for human use. The dosage contained in such compositions is preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include an ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration.
The exact dosage will be determined by the practitioner, in light of factors related to the subject that requires treatment. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active agent(s) or to maintain the desired effect. Factors which may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, general health of the subject, age, weight, and gender of the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and tolerance/response to therapy. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or once every two weeks depending on half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation.
In one aspect, treating a condition described herein results in an increase in average survival time of a population of treated subjects in comparison to a population of untreated subjects.

As described elsewhere herein, the compounds described herein may be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions, if desired, and can be administered by any route that permits treatment of the disease or condition. A preferred route of administration is oral administration. Administration may take the form of single dose administration, or the compound of the embodiments can be administered over a period of time, either in divided doses or in a continuous-release formulation or administration method (e.g., a pump). However the compounds of the embodiments are administered to the subject, the amounts of compound administered and the route of administration chosen should be selected to permit efficacious treatment of the disease condition.
Further embodiments include administering a combination of compounds to a subject in need thereof. A combination can include a compound, composition, pharmaceutical composition described herein with an additional medicament.
Some embodiments include co-administering a compound, composition, and/or pharmaceutical composition described herein, with an additional medicament. By “co-administration,” it is meant that the two or more agents may be found in the patient's bloodstream at the same time, regardless of when or how they are actually administered. In some embodiments, the agents are administered simultaneously. In some such such embodiments, administration in combination is accomplished by combining the agents in a single dosage form. In some embodiments, the agents are administered sequentially. In some embodiments the agents are administered through the same route, such as orally. In some other embodiments, the agents are administered through different routes, such as one being administered orally and another being administered i.v. Thus, for example, the combination of active ingredients may be: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by any other combination therapy regimen known in the art. When delivered in alternation therapy, the methods described herein may comprise administering or delivering the active ingredients sequentially, e.g., in separate solution, emulsion, suspension, tablets, pills or capsules, or by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in simultaneous therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together. Various sequences of intermittent combination therapy may also be used.

ET-1 Assay
Assay of Inhibitory Effect on TGF-b Induced Endothelin-1 Production
Fibroblasts (primary human lung and dermal, HFL-1, 3T3 etc) are seeded in 96-well plates at ˜15000 cells/well and serum starved for 0-48 hours. After media exchange, compounds serially diluted in DMSO are added to the cells. After a brief incubation of ˜30 min, stimulants (TGFb, serum, LPA etc) are added followed by further incubation for 16-48 hours. Media is then harvested and stored frozen in plate format for later endothelin-1 (ET-1) determination by ELISA. Toxicity measurements are made using the ATPlite kit (Perkin-Elmer). ET-1 is quantified using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems). The amount of ET-1 produced in the assay wells are back-calculated using the ELISA standard. The ability of a compound to inhibit ET-1 production is typically analyzed by fitting dose-response curves to a 4-parameter logistic function to obtain an EC50 value. A measure of cytotoxicity (CC50) is likewise reported from the same experiment using the ATPlite data.

Cell Proliferation Assay
Assay of Inhibitory Effect on Cell Proliferation (BrdU Incorporation)
Fibroblasts (primary human lung and dermal, HFL-1, 3T3 etc) were plated on a 96-well plate and serum starved for 24-48 hours. The media were then exchanged for media containing stimulants (LPA, TGFb, serum etc) and cultured further for 16-24 hours before BrdU addition. After culturing for another 8 hours, cells were washed with PBS and the amount of BrdU incorporated into the cells was assayed by absorbance at 450 nm using the Cell proliferation ELISA system (RPN250, Amersham LIFE SCIENCE). The difference between the amount of BrdU incorporated in the stimulant-added well and the amount of BrdU incorporated in the well containing no stimulant represented the amount of BrdU incorporation accelerated by stimulant. The increase of BrdU incorporation without the addition of test compounds was set as 100% and the concentration of compound with 50% inhibition in the increase of BrdU incorporation (IC50 value) was determined. The test compounds were added 0-30 min before stimulant addition.
Assay Data for Compounds
Compounds of some embodiments were prepared according to synthetic methods described herein and assay data obtained for IC50 for BrdU inhibition. The assay data obtained is presented in Table 3, in which A=less than 50 μM, B=greater than or equal to 50 μM and less than or equal to 200 μM; and C=greater than 200 μM.  TABLE 3

While the disclosure has been illustrated and described in detail in the foregoing description, such illustration and description are to be considered illustrative or exemplary and not restrictive. The disclosure is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. Variations to the disclosed embodiments can be understood and effected by those skilled in the art in practicing the claimed disclosure, from a study of the drawings, the disclosure and the appended claims.
All references cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. To the extent publications and patents or patent applications incorporated by reference contradict the disclosure contained in the specification, the specification is intended to supersede and/or take precedence over any such contradictory material.
Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) are to be given their ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are not to be limited to a special or customized meaning unless expressly so defined herein. It should be noted that the use of particular terminology when describing certain features or aspects of the disclosure should not be taken to imply that the terminology is being re-defined herein to be restricted to include any specific characteristics of the features or aspects of the disclosure with which that terminology is associated.
Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that the upper and lower limit, and each intervening value between the upper and lower limit of the range is encompassed within the embodiments.
Terms and phrases used in this application, and variations thereof, especially in the appended claims, unless otherwise expressly stated, should be construed as open ended as opposed to limiting. As examples of the foregoing, the term ‘including’ should be read to mean ‘including, without limitation,’ ‘including but not limited to,’ or the like; the term ‘comprising’ as used herein is synonymous with ‘including,’ ‘containing,’ or ‘characterized by,’ and is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps; the term ‘having’ should be interpreted as ‘having at least;’ the term ‘includes’ should be interpreted as ‘includes but is not limited to;’ the term ‘example’ is used to provide exemplary instances of the item in discussion, not an exhaustive or limiting list thereof; adjectives such as ‘known’, ‘normal’, ‘standard’, and terms of similar meaning should not be construed as limiting the item described to a given time period or to an item available as of a given time, but instead should be read to encompass known, normal, or standard technologies that may be available or known now or at any time in the future; and use of terms like ‘preferably,’ ‘preferred,’ ‘desired,’ or ‘desirable,’ and words of similar meaning should not be understood as implying that certain features are critical, essential, or even important to the structure or function of the invention, but instead as merely intended to highlight alternative or additional features that may or may not be utilized in a particular embodiment of the invention. Likewise, a group of items linked with the conjunction ‘and’ should not be read as requiring that each and every one of those items be present in the grouping, but rather should be read as ‘and/or’ unless expressly stated otherwise. Similarly, a group of items linked with the conjunction ‘or’ should not be read as requiring mutual exclusivity among that group, but rather should be read as ‘and/or’ unless expressly stated otherwise.
With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity. The indefinite article “a” or “an” does not exclude a plurality. A single processor or other unit may fulfill the functions of several items recited in the claims. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage. Any reference signs in the claims should not be construed as limiting the scope.
It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases “at least one” and “one or more” to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles “a” or “an” limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases “one or more” or “at least one” and indefinite articles such as “a” or “an” (e.g., “a” and/or “an” should typically be interpreted to mean “at least one” or “one or more”); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of “two recitations,” without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to “at least one of A, B, and C, etc.” is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., “a system having at least one of A, B, and C” would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to “at least one of A, B, or C, etc.” is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., “a system having at least one of A, B, or C” would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase “A or B” will be understood to include the possibilities of “A” or “B” or “A and B.”
All numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term ‘about.’ Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth herein are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of any claims in any application claiming priority to the present application, each numerical parameter should be construed in light of the number of significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches.
Furthermore, although the foregoing has been described in some detail by way of illustrations and examples for purposes of clarity and understanding, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that certain changes and modifications may be practiced. Therefore, the description and examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention to the specific embodiments and examples described herein, but rather to also cover all modification and alternatives coming with the true scope and spirit of the invention.
