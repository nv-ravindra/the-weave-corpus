FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to bis(sulfonamide) compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, and to their use as medicaments for the treatment and/or prevention of a disease, disorder or condition in which modulation of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 activity is beneficial, such as pain, inflammation and cancer.
BACKGROUND
Modulation of prostaglandin metabolism is at the centre of current anti-inflammatory therapies. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors block the activity of cyclooxygenases and their ability to convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). PGH2 can be subsequently metabolized by terminal prostaglandin synthases to the corresponding biologically active PGs, namely, PGI2, thromboxane (Tx) A2, PGD2, PGF2a and PGE2. A combination of pharmacological, genetic and neutralizing antibody approaches demonstrates the importance of PGE2 in inflammation. The conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 by prostaglandin E synthases (PGES) may therefore represent a pivotal step in the propagation of inflammatory stimuli.
Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) is an inducible PGES after exposure to pro-inflammatory stimuli. mPGES-1 is induced in the periphery and in the CNS by inflammation and represents therefore a target for acute and chronic inflammatory disorders.
PGE2 is a major prostanoid driving inflammatory processes. The prostanoid is produced from arachidonic acid liberated by Phospholipases (PLAs). Arachidonic acid is transformed by the action of Prostaglandin H Synthase (PGH Synthase, cyclooxygenase) into PGH2, which is a substrate for mPGES-1, which is the terminal enzyme transforming PGH2 to the pro-inflammatory PGE2.
NSAIDs reduce PGE2 by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, but at the same time reducing other prostanoids, giving side effects such as ulcerations in the GI tract. mPGES-1 inhibition gives a similar effect on PGE2 production without affecting the formation of other prostanoids, and hence a more favourable profile.
By blocking the formation of PGE2 in animal models of inflammatory pain a reduced inflammation, pain and fever response has been demonstrated (see e.g. Kojima et. al, The Journal of Immunology 2008, 180(12): 8361-8368; Xu et al., The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2008, 326(3): 754-763).
Osteoarthritis is an inflammation of one or more joints, caused by the loss of cartilage leading to loss of water, while rheumatoid arthritis is considered to be of autoimmune origin. In several models of arthritis, inhibition of mPGES-1 leads to a reduced inflammation and/or pain (Kojima et al., Fundamental & Clinical Pharmacology 2005, 19(3): 255-261).
In abdominal aortic aneurism, inflammation leads to connective tissue degradation and smooth muscle apoptosis ultimately leading to aortic dilation and rupture. In animals lacking mPGES-1 a slower disease progression and disease severity has been demonstrated (see e.g. Wang et al., Circulation 2008, 117(10): 1302-1309).
Several lines of evidence indicate that PGE2 is involved in malignant growth. PGE2 facilitates tumor progression of many different types of cancers, by stimulation of cellular proliferation and angiogenesis and by modulation of immunosuppression (see e.g. Menter et al., International Journal of Cell Biology 2012; Nakanishi et al., Biochimie 2010, 92(6): 660-664; Kamata et al., Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy 2010, 64(6): 409-416; Beales et al., Int. J. Cancer 2010, 126(9): 2247-2255). In support of a role for PGE2 in carcinogenesis, genetic deletion of mPGES-1 in mice suppresses the intestinal tumourogenesis (Nakanishi et al., Cancer Research 2008, 68(9): 3251-3259), hepatocarcinogenesis (Lu et al., Oncogene 2012, 31(7): 842-857) and bone cancer (Isono et al., Life Sciences 2011, 88(15-16): 693-700). In man, mPGES-1 is also upregulated in cancers such as colorectal cancer (see e.g. Schröder et al., Journal of Lipid Research 2006, 47(5): 1071-80) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLS) (Wang et al., Annals of Surgical Oncology 2006, 13(9): 1224-1234).
Myositis is chronic muscle disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue.
Proinflammatory cytokines and prostanoids have been implicated in the development of myositis. In skeletal muscle tissue from patients suffering from myositis, an increase in cyclooxygenases and mPGES-1 has been demonstrated, implicating mPGES-1 as a target for treating this condition (see e.g. Korotkova et al., Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 2008, 67(11): 1596-1602).
In atherosclerosis, inflammation of the vasculature leads to atheroma formation that eventually may progress into infarction. In patients with carotid atherosclerosis, an increase in mPGES-1 in plaque regions has been found (Gómez-Hernández et al., Atherosclerosis 2006, 187(1): 139-149). In an animal model of atherosclerosis, mice lacking the mPGES-1 receptor were found to show a retarded atherogenesis and a concomitant reduction in macrophage-derived foam cells together with an increase in vascular smooth muscle cells (see e.g. Wang et al., Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences 2006, 103(39): 14507-14512) and reduced neointimal hyperplasia (Wang et al. Circulation 2011, 123(6): 631-639).
PGE-2, produced via mPGES-1, exerts a control of apnea frequency and mPGES-1 KO mice show reduced sensitivity to IL-1 induced anoxia (Hofstetter et al., Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences 2007, 104(23), 9894-9899).
Inflammation is part of the Alzheimer pathology, and mPGES-1 levels are higher in neuronal tissue from AD patients (Chaudhry et al., Alzheimer's & Dementia 2008, 4(1): 6-13).
Bis(sulfonamide) compounds which are useful for the treatment of pain and inflammatory diseases have been suggested in WO2007/042817, WO2008/129276, WO2008/129288, WO2009/064250, WO2009/064251, WO2009/082347 and WO2010/132016.
There is still a need for compounds that have an improved potency and improved selectivity to PGE2. There is a need for compounds having reduced side effect, such as gastrointestinal and renal toxicity.

As used herein, the term “C3-7-cycloalkyl”, used alone or as suffix or prefix, denotes a cyclic saturated alkyl group having a ring size from 3 to 7 carbon atoms and includes cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl.
As used herein, the term “halogen” or “halo”, used alone or as suffix or prefix, is intended to include bromine, chlorine, fluorine or iodine.
As used herein, the term “optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may but need not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.
As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
As used herein, the phrase “protecting group” means temporary substituents protecting a potentially reactive functional group from undesired chemical transformations. Examples of such protecting groups include esters of carboxylic acids, silyl ethers of alcohols, and acetals and ketals of aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The field of protecting group chemistry has been extensively reviewed (see, e.g. Jarowicki, K.; Kocienski, P. Perkin Trans. 1, 2001, issue 18, p. 2109). As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to forms of the disclosed compounds, wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues, such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. Such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid.
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media like diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are used.
A variety of compounds in the present invention may exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The present invention takes into account all such compounds, including tautomers, R- and S-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as being covered within the scope of this invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention. The compounds herein described may have asymmetric centers. Compounds of the present invention containing an asymmetrically substituted atom may be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms, by synthesis from optically active starting materials, or synthesis using optically active reagents. When required, separation of the racemic material can be achieved by methods known in the art. All chiral, diastereomeric and racemic forms are intended, to be included in the scope of the invention, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated.
As used herein, “tautomer” means other structural isomers that exist in equilibrium resulting from the migration of a hydrogen atom. For example, keto-enol tautomerism occurs where the resulting compound has the properties of both a ketone and an unsaturated alcohol.
As used herein, the phrase “compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts” include hydrates and solvates thereof.
Compounds and salts described in this specification may be isotopically-labelled compounds (or “radio-labelled”). In that instance, one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Examples of suitable isotopes that may be incorporated include 2H (also written as “D” for deuterium), 3H (also written as “T” for tritium), 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 18F, 35S, 36Cl, 82Br, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br, 123I, 124I, 125I and 131I. The radionuclide that is used will depend on the specific application of that radio-labelled derivative. For example, for in vitro receptor labelling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate 3H or 14C are often useful. For radio-imaging applications 11C or 18F are often useful.

Biological Assays
Assays for Determining Biological Activity
Inhibition of Prostaglandin E Synthase Activity
Compounds were tested as inhibitors of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase activity in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase assays and whole cell assays. These assays measure prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis, which is taken as a measure of prostaglandin E synthase activity. Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase biochemical assays used microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 in microsomal preparations. The source of the microsomes can be for example interleukin-1β-stimulated human A549 cells (which express human mPGES-1) or Sf9 cells transfected with plasmids encoding human mPGES-1 cDNA.
The whole blood assay [described by Patrignani, P. et al, Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1994, vol. 271, pp 1705-1712] was used as the whole cell assay for testing the compounds. Whole blood provides a protein and cell rich environment for the study of biochemical efficacy of anti-inflammatory compounds, such as prostaglandin synthase inhibitors. To study the inhibitory activities of these compounds, human blood was stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for typically 16 hours to induce mPGES-1 expression, after which the concentration of produced PGE2 was measured by competitive-immuno assay (homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence, HTRF) as read out for effectiveness against mPGES-1-dependent PGE2 production.
Microsomal Prostaglandin E Synthase Biochemical Assay
A solution of test compound was added to a diluted microsome preparation containing human mPGES-1 and pre-incubated for 15 minutes in potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.8 with cofactor glutathione (GSH). Corresponding solutions without test compound were used as positive controls, and corresponding solutions without test compound and without microsomes were used as negative controls. The enzymatic reaction was then started by addition of the substrate PGH2 in an organic solution (dry acetonitrile).
The typical reaction conditions of the enzymatic reaction were thus: Test compound: ranging from 60 μM to 0.002 μM, or zero in positive and negative controls; potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.8: 50 mM; GSH: 2.5 mM; mPGES-1-containing microsomes: 2 μg/mL (sample and positive controls) or 0 μg/mL (negative control); PGH2: 10.8 μM; Acetonitrile: 7.7% (v/v); DMSO: 0.6% (v/v). The reaction was stopped after one minute by adding an acidic solution (pH 1.9) of ferric chloride and citrate (final concentrations 7 mM and 47 mM respectively), by which the PGH2 was sequestered (the PGH2 is reduced to mainly 12-hydroxy heptadecatrineoic acid (12-HHT) which is not detected by the subsequent PGE2 detection step). The resulting solution was then pH neutralized by addition of potassium phosphate buffer, prior to diluting an aliquot of the resulting solution in a weak potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.8) containing 0.2% BSA (w/v). [Adapted from Jacobsson et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1999, vol. 96, pp. 7220-7225] The PGE2 formed was quantified by use of a commercial HTRF based kit (catalogue #62PG2PEC or #62P2APEC from Cisbio International). 100% activity was defined as the PGE2 production in positive controls subtracted by the PGE2 production in the negative controls. IC50 values were then determined using standard procedures.
Data from this assay for representative compounds is shown in the Table below. The potency is expressed as IC50 and the value indicated is an average of at least n=2. The data indicate that the compounds of the invention are expected to possess useful therapeutic properties.

Whole Blood Assay
Human blood collected from human volunteers in heparinized tubes was incubated with 100 μM acetyl salicylic acid, in order to inhibit the constitutively expressed cyclooxygenase (COX)-1/COX-2 enzymes, and then stimulated with 0.1 μg/ml LPS to induce the expression of enzymes along the COX-2 pathway, e.g. COX-2 and mPGES-1. 100 μL of this blood was added to the wells of a 384-well plate containing 1 μL DMSO solutions of compounds typically in the final concentration range 316 μM to 0.01 μM. Naproxen was used as reference compound. The mix was incubated at 37° C. for 16 hours. Plasma was harvested by centrifugation and stored at −70° C. until further analysis of PGE2 levels. For the calculations, the 0%-activity value was represented by blood treated with acetyl salicylic acid, LPS and the reference compound (1 mM Naproxen). The 100%-activity value was represented by blood treated with aspirin, LPS and DMSO. [Reference: Patrignani, P. et al, Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1994, vol. 271, pp 1705-1712]. The PGE2 formed was quantified, after dilution in a weak potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.8) containing 0.2% BSA (w/v), by use of a commercial HTRF based kit (catalogue #62PG2PEC or #62P2APEC from Cisbio International). IC50 values were then determined using standard procedures.
The results show that the novel bis(sulfonamide) compounds are selective inhibitors of the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 enzyme. The compounds have an improved potency and selectivity.
