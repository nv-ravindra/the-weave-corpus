TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to novel urea compounds which are useful for inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), methods of making the compounds, compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine kinase encoded by two isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β with molecular weights of 51 and 47 kDa, respectively. These share 97% sequence similarity in their kinase catalytic domains. The GSK-3α isoform has an extended glycine-rich N-terminal tail. A minor splice variant of GSK-3β has been identified (expressed at ˜15% of total) with a 13 amino acid insert within the kinase domain. This variant had a reduced activity towards tau. GSK-3 is highly conserved throughout evolution, and found in all mammalians thus far with high homology in the kinase domain. Both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, including the brain. Pharmacological GSK-3 inhibitors are not able to selectively inhibit one of the isoforms.
GSK-3β plays an important role in the control of metabolism, differentiation and survival. It was initially identified as an enzyme able to phosphorylate and hence inhibit glycogen synthase. Subsequently, it was recognised that GSK-3β was identical to tau protein kinase 1 (TPK1), an enzyme that phosphorylates tau protein in epitopes that are also found to be hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease and in several taupathies.
Interestingly, protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation of GSK-3β results in a loss of kinase activity, and it has been proposed that this inhibition may mediate some of the effects of neurotrophic factors. Moreover, phosphorylation of β-catenin (a protein involved in cell survival) by GSK-3β, results in its degradation by an ubiquitinilation dependent proteasome pathway.
Therefore it appears that inhibition of GSK-3β activity may result in neurotrophic activity. There is evidence that lithium, an uncompetitive inhibitor of GSK-3β, enhances neuritogenesis in some models and can also increase neuronal survival, through the induction of survival factors such as Bcl-2 and the inhibition of the expression of proapoptotic factors such as P53 and Bax.
Further studies have shown that β-amyloid increases GSK-3β activity and tau protein phosphorylation. Moreover, this hyperphosphorylation as well as the neurotoxic effects of β-amyloid are blocked by lithium chloride and by a GSK-3β antisense mRNA. These observations taken together suggest that GSK-3β may be the link between the two major pathological processes in Alzheimer's disease: abnormal APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) processing and tau protein hyperphosphorylation.
These experimental observations indicate that compounds which modulate the GSK-3β activity may find application in the treatment of the neuropathological consequences and the cognitive and attention deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease, as well as other acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. These include, but are not limited to: Parkinson's disease, tauopathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy) and other dementia including vascular dementia; acute stroke and others traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular accidents (e.g. age related macular degeneration); brain and spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies; retinopathies and glaucoma.
GSK-3β may also have utility in the treatment of other diseases such as: Non-insulin dependent diabetes and obesity; osteoporosis; manic depressive illness; schizophrenia; alopecia; cancers such as breast cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia and several virus-induced tumors.
A review on GSK-3, its functions, its therapeutic potential and its possible inhibitors is given in “Glykogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GDK-3) and its inhibitors: Drug Discovery and Developments” by A. Martinez et al. (editors), John Wiley and Sons, 2006.

They also describe several pyridazino[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-ones being unsubstituted at the nitrogen as intermediates, namely pyridazino[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one, 3-chloropyridazinobenzo[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one, 3-chloro-8-trifluoromethylpyridazino[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one, 3-chloro-8-methylpyridazino[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one, 3-chloro-9-methylpyridazino [3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one, 3-chloro-8-methoxypyridazino[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one and 3-chloro-8,10-dimethylpyridazinobenzo[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one.

Chem. 2000, 333, 231-240) describe pyridazinobenzo[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-ones being unsubstituted at the nitrogen as intermediates in the synthesis of the corresponding N-alkyl derivatives, namely 3-chloropyridazinobenzo[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one, 3,8-dichloropyridazino[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one, 3-chloro-8-methylpyridazino[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one and 3-chloro-9-methylpyridazino[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one.

They also describe several pyridazinobenzo[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-ones being unsubstituted at the nitrogen as intermediates, e.g. 3-chloro-9-trifluoromethylpyridazino[3,4-b][1,5]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
According to the invention, the compounds of the general formula I having the meanings mentioned at the outset have a modulating, and in particular inhibitory activity against GSK-3β. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention are useful for treatment of a medical disorder susceptible to treatment with a compound that modulates and in particular inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3β activity. The term “treatment”, as used herein includes preventive treatment and therapeutic treatment. Thus, these compounds are useful as an active ingredient for the preparation of a composition, which enables treatment of a disease caused by abnormal GSK-3β activity and more particularly of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the compounds of the present invention are also useful for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, tauopathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy) and other dementia including vascular dementia; acute stroke and others traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular accidents (e.g. age related macular degeneration); brain and spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies; retinopathies and glaucoma. The compounds are also useful for treatment of other medical disorders susceptible to treatment with a compound that modulates and in particular inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3β activity, such as non-insulin dependent diabetes (such as diabetes type II) and obesity; manic depressive illness; schizophrenia; alopecia; cancers such as breast cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia and several virus-induced tumors.
Provided the compounds of the formula I of a given constitution may exist in different spatial arrangements, for example if they possess one or more centers of asymmetry, polysubstituted rings or double bonds, or as different tautomers, it is also possible to use enantiomeric mixtures, in particular racemates, diastereomeric mixtures and tautomeric mixtures, preferably, however, the respective essentially pure enantiomers, diastereomers and tautomers of the compounds of formula I and/or of their salts.
It is likewise possible to use physiologically tolerated salts of the compounds of the formula I, especially acid addition salts with physiologically tolerated acids. Examples of suitable physiologically tolerated organic and inorganic acids are hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, C1-C4-alkylsulfonic acids, such as methanesulfonic acid, aromatic sulfonic acids, such as benzenesulfonic acid and toluenesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, adipic acid and benzoic acid.

The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by analogy to routine techniques, a skilled person is familiar with. In particular, the compounds of the formula I can be prepared according to the following schemes, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, m, n, o, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, Y3, Y4 and Y5 are as defined above:
The amine 1 can be acylated by reaction with an acyl azide 2 (prepared by reaction of the corresponding acyl halide with a metal azide salt according to standard methods of organic chemistry) to give disubstituted ureas of general formula 3. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent such as toluene or N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of from 20-120° C. Other conditions for describing this transformation (known as the Curtius rearrangement) are described in the following articles: Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1986, 51, 3007 & 5123; Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1987, 52, 4875; Tetrahedron Letters, 1984, 25, 3515; and Organic Reactions, 1947, 3, 337.
Disubstituted urea compounds of the general formula I can also be prepared according to a route depicted in scheme 2.
The amine 1 can be acylated by reaction with an isocyanate 4 to give disubstituted ureas of general formula 3. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent such as toluene or N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of from 20-120° C.
Disubstituted urea compounds of the general formula I can also be prepared according to a route depicted in scheme 3.
The amine 1 can be converted to trichloroacetamide 5 by reaction with trichloroacetyl chloride The reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent such as toluene or N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of from 20-120° C. The trichloroacetamide 5 can be reacted with an amine 6 to give disubstituted ureas of general formula 3.
Amide analogs of the general formula 8 can also be prepared according to a route depicted in scheme 4.
The carboxylic acid 7 can be converted to amide 8 by reaction an amine 6 using standard amide formation conditions familiar to those skilled in the art. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent such dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide or THF. The reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of from 20-120° C. Coupling reagents such as HOBT or carbonyl diimidazole are employed.
If not indicated otherwise, the above-described reactions are generally carried out in a solvent at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling temperature of the solvent employed. Alternatively, the activation energy which is required for the reaction can be introduced into the reaction mixture using microwaves, something which has proved to be of value, in particular, in the case of the reactions catalyzed by transition metals (with regard to reactions using microwaves, see Tetrahedron 2001, 57, p. 9199 ff. p. 9225 ff. and also, in a general manner, “Microwaves in Organic Synthesis”, AndréLoupy (Ed.), Wiley-VCH 2002.
The acid addition salts of compounds I are prepared in a customary manner by mixing the free base with a corresponding acid, where appropriate in solution in an organic solvent, for example a lower alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, an ether, such as methyl tert-butyl ether or diisopropyl ether, a ketone, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, or an ester, such as ethyl acetate.
The compounds of the formula I according to the present invention (and likewise the compounds of the formulae 1a, 1b and 1c), as well as the stereoisomers, the prodrugs and physiologically tolerated acid addition salts thereof, are capable of modulating the activity on glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In particular, the compounds of the formula I (and likewise the compounds of the formulae 1a, 1b and 1c), as well as the stereoisomers, the prodrugs and physiologically tolerated acid addition salts thereof, have an inhibitory activity on glycogen synthase kinase 3β. Amongst the compounds of the formula I those are preferred, which achieve effective inhibition at low concentrations. In particular, compounds of the formula I are preferred, which inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3β at a level of IC50<1 μMol, more preferably at a level of IC50<0.5 μMol, particularly preferably at a level of IC50<0.2 μMol and most preferably at a level of IC50<0.1 μMol.
Therefore the compounds of the formula I according to the present invention, their prodrugs and their physiologically tolerated acid addition salts are useful for the treatment of a medical disorder susceptible to treatment with a compound that modulates glycogen synthase kinase 3β activity. As mentioned above, diseases caused by abnormal GSK-3β activity and which thus can be treated by supplying the compound of the formula I and/or an acid addition salt thereof, include in particular neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the compounds of the present invention are also useful for treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, tauopathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy) and other dementia including vascular dementia; acute stroke and others traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular accidents (e.g. age related macular degeneration); brain and spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies; retinopathies and glaucoma.
Within the meaning of the invention, a treatment also includes a preventive treatment (prophylaxis), in particular as relapse prophylaxis or phase prophylaxis, as well as the treatment of acute or chronic signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions. The treatment can be orientated symptomatically, for example as the suppression of symptoms. It can be effected over a short period, be orientated over the medium term or can be a long-term treatment, for example within the context of a maintenance therapy.
Within the context of the treatment, the use according to the invention of the compounds of the formula I involves a method. In this method, an effective quantity of one or more compounds, as a rule formulated in accordance with pharmaceutical and veterinary practice, is administered to the individual to be treated, preferably a mammal, in particular a human being, productive animal or domestic animal. Whether such a treatment is indicated, and in which form it is to take place, depends on the individual case and is subject to medical assessment (diagnosis) which takes into consideration signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions which are present, the risks of developing particular signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions, and other factors.
As a rule, the treatment is effected by means of single or repeated daily administration, where appropriate together, or alternating, with other active compounds or active compound-containing preparations such that a daily dose of preferably from about 0.1 to 1000 mg/kg of bodyweight, in the case of oral administration, or of from about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg of bodyweight, in the case of parenteral administration, is supplied to an individual to be treated.
The invention also relates to the production of pharmaceutical compositions for treating an individual, preferably a mammal, in particular a human being, productive animal or domestic animal. Thus, the ligands are customarily administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient together with at least one compound according to the invention and, where appropriate, other active compounds. These compositions can, for example, be administered orally, rectally, transdermally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly or intranasally.
Examples of suitable pharmaceutical formulations are solid medicinal forms, such as powders, granules, tablets, in particular film tablets, lozenges, sachets, cachets, sugar-coated tablets, capsules, such as hard gelatin capsules and soft gelatin capsules, suppositories or vaginal medicinal forms, semisolid medicinal forms, such as ointments, creams, hydrogels, pastes or plasters, and also liquid medicinal forms, such as solutions, emulsions, in particular oil-in-water emulsions, suspensions, for example lotions, injection preparations and infusion preparations, and eyedrops and eardrops. Implanted release devices can also be used for administering inhibitors according to the invention. In addition, it is also possible to use liposomes or microspheres.
When producing the compositions, the compounds according to the invention are optionally mixed or diluted with one or more excipients. Excipients can be solid, semisolid or liquid materials which serve as vehicles, carriers or medium for the active compound.
Suitable excipients are listed in the specialist medicinal monographs. In addition, the formulations can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or customary auxiliary substances, such as glidants; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preservatives; antioxidants; anti irritants; chelating agents; coating auxiliaries; emulsion stabilizers; film formers; gel formers; odor masking agents; taste corrigents; resin; hydrocolloids; solvents; solubilizers; neutralizing agents; diffusion accelerators; pigments; quaternary ammonium compounds; refatting and overfatting agents; raw materials for ointments, creams or oils; silicone derivatives; spreading auxiliaries; stabilizers; sterilants; suppository bases; tablet auxiliaries, such as binders, fillers, glidants, disintegrants or coatings; propellants; drying agents; opacifiers; thickeners; waxes; plasticizers and white mineral oils. A formulation in this regard is based on specialist knowledge as described, for example, in Fiedler, H. P., Lexikon der Hilfsstoffe für Pharmazie, Kosmetik and angrenzende Gebiete [Encyclopedia of auxiliary substances for pharmacy, cosmetics and related fields], 4th edition, Aulendorf: ECV-Editio-Kantor-Verlag, 1996.
The following examples serve to explain the invention without limiting it.
The compounds were either characterized via proton-NMR in d6-dimethylsulfoxide or d-chloroform on a 400 MHz or 500 MHz NMR instrument (Bruker AVANCE), or by mass spectrometry, generally recorded via HPLC-MS in a fast gradient on C18-material (electrospray-ionisation (ESI) mode), or melting point.
The magnetic nuclear resonance spectral properties (NMR) refer to the chemical shifts (δ) expressed in parts per million (ppm). The relative area of the shifts in the 1H-NMR spectrum corresponds to the number of hydrogen atoms for a particular functional type in the molecule. The nature of the shift, as regards multiplicity, is indicated as singlet (s), broad singlet (s. br.), doublet (d), broad doublet (d br.), triplet (t), broad triplet (t br.), quartet (q), quintet (quint.) and multiplet (m).

Biological Tests:
The compounds according to the invention exhibit very good affinities for GSK-3 (<1 μM, frequently<100 nM) and exhibited good selectivity against multiple kinase targets.
Methods—Biochemical hGSK-3Beta Assay
Compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit human Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 beta (hGSK-3β) to phosphorylate biotin-YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQ(pS)EDEEE. Compounds were incubated with 0.5 μCi 33P-ATP, 10 μM ATP, 0.0125 U hGSK-3β (Upstate cell signaling solutions) and 1 μM substrate (biotin-YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQ(pS)EDEEE) in 50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM DTT, 0.0075% Triton, 2% DMSO (total volume 50 μL) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The incubation was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 100 mM EDTA, 4M NaCl. 80 μL of this mixture was added to streptavidin-coated Flashplates (PerkinElmer). Following a wash step, 33P incorporation was quantified on a MicroBeta microplate liquid scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer). IC50's were determined by fitting a sigmoidal dose-response curve to the counts obtained at the different concentrations in Graph Pad Prism.
Methods—β-Catenin Reporter-Gene Assay
Compounds were tested for their ability to modulate β-catenin-modulated gene transcription in a LEF/TCF(T-cell factor) reporter gene assay. SY-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were transiently transfected with 80 ng/well TOPFLASH plasmid (Upstate cell signaling solutions) containing two sets of three copies of the TCF binding site upstream of the Thymidine Kinase minimal promoter and firefly Luciferase open reading frame or with 80 ng/well FOPFLASH plasmid (Upstate cell signaling solutions) containing three copies of a mutated TCF binding site upstream of the Thymidine Kinase minimal promoter and firefly Luciferase open reading frame. In addition all cells were transiently transfected with the 20 ng/well pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter to provide low to moderate levels of Renilla Luciferase expression. Transfection medium was exchanged for serum-free medium containing the test substance and incubated for 24 h at 37 degree C. The incubation was stopped and quantified using the Dual Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega) as indicated and quantified on a Pherastar reader (BMG).
Firefly Luciferase activity was normalised for Renilla Luciferase activity per well. Subsequently, the normalised TOPFLASH response was compared to the normalised FOPFLASH response, thus giving the LEF/TCF specific signal. The maximal response is the maximal ratio between the normalised TOPFLASH and FOPFLASH signals. Sigmoidal dose-response curves were fitted using Graphpad Prism.
The results of the binding tests are given in the table below.
