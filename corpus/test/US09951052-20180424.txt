BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The Renal Outer Medullary Potassium (ROMK) channel (Kir1.1) (see e.g., Ho, K., et al., Cloning and expression of an inwardly rectifying ATP-regulated potassium channel, Nature, 1993, 362(6415): p. 31-8.1, 2; and Shuck, M. E., et al., Cloning and characterization of multiple forms of the human kidney ROM-K potassium channel, J Biol Chem, 1994, 269(39): p. 24261-70) is a member of the inward rectifier family of potassium channels expressed in two regions of the kidney: thick ascending loop of Henle (TALH) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) (see Hebert, S. C., et al., Molecular diversity and regulation of renal potassium channels, Physiol Rev, 2005, 85(1): p. 319-713). At the TALH, ROMK participates in potassium recycling across the luminal membrane which is critical for the function of the Na+/K+/2Cl— co-transporter, the rate-determining step for salt reuptake in this part of the nephron. At the CCD, ROMK provides a pathway for potassium secretion that is tightly coupled to sodium uptake through the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (see Reinalter, S. C., et al., Pharmacotyping of hypokalaemic salt-losing tubular disorders, Acta Physiol Scand, 2004, 181(4): p. 513-21; and Wang, W., Renal potassium channels: recent developments, Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens, 2004, 13(5): p. 549-55). Selective inhibitors of the ROMK channel (also referred to herein as inhibitors of ROMK or ROMK inhibitors) are expected to represent novel diuretics for the treatment of hypertension and other conditions where treatment with a diuretic would be beneficial with potentially reduced liabilities (i.e., hypo- or hyperkalemia, new onset of diabetes, dyslipidemia) over the currently used clinical agents (see Lifton, R. P., A. G. Gharavi, and D. S. Geller, Molecular mechanisms of human hypertension, Cell, 2001, 104(4): p. 545-56). Human genetics (Ji, W., et al., Rare independent mutations in renal salt handling genes contribute to blood pressure variation, Nat Genet, 2008, 40(5): p. 592-9; and Tobin, M. D., et al., Common variants in genes underlying monogenic hypertension and hypotension and blood pressure in the general population, Hypertension, 2008, 51(6): p. 1658-64) and genetic ablation of ROMK in rodents (see Lorenz, J. N., et al., Impaired renal NaCl absorption in mice lacking the ROMK potassium channel, a model for type II Bartter's syndrome, J Biol Chem, 2002, 277(40): p. 37871-80 and Lu, M., et al., Absence of small conductance K+ channel (SK) activity in apical membranes of thick ascending limb and cortical collecting duct in ROMK (Bartter's) knockout mice, J Biol Chem, 2002, 277(40): p. 37881-7) support these expectations. To our knowledge, the first publicly disclosed small molecule selective inhibitors of ROMK, including VU590, were reported from work done at Vanderbilt University as described in Lewis, L. M., et al., High-Throughput Screening Reveals a Small-Molecule Inhibitor of the Renal Outer Medullary Potassium Channel and Kir7.1, Mol Pharmacol, 2009, 76(5): p. 1094-1103. The compound VU591 was later reported in Bhave, G. et al., Development of a Selective Small-Molecule Inhibitor of Kir1.1, the Renal Outer Medullary Potassium Channel, Mol Pharmacol, 2011, 79(1), p. 42-50, the text of which states that “ROMK (Kir1.1), is a putative drug target for a novel class of loop diuretics that would lower blood pressure without causing hypokalemia.”
Patent application publication number WO2010/129379, published Nov. 11, 2010 having common representative Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., (also published as US2010/0286123 on same date), describes ROMK inhibitors having the generic formula: and, e.g., an embodiment wherein R5 and R6 are independently —H, —C1-6 alkyl, —C3-6 cycloalkyl, —CF3, —CHF2, —CH2F or —CH2OH; X is —H, —OH, —OC1-3alkyl, —F, oxo, NH2 or —CH3; and X1 is —H or —CH3.
Patent application publication number WO2012/058134, published May 3, 2012, having common representative Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., describes ROMK inhibitors having the generic formula: wherein A and B are mono and/or bicyclic aromatic groups; R2 is —H, —C1-6 alkyl, —C3-6 cycloalkyl, CF3, —CH2OH, or —CO2R, or R2 can be joined to R1 or R10a to form a ring; R3 is —H, —C1-6 alkyl, —C3-6 cycloalkyl, —OH, —F, —OC1-3 alkyl, or —CH2OH, or R3 can be joined to R10b to form a ring.
Patent application publication number WO2012/058116, published May 3, 2012, having common representative Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., describes ROMK inhibitors having the generic formula: and, e.g., an embodiment wherein R5 and R6 are independently —H, —C1-6 alkyl or —C(O)OC1-3alkyl; and X, X1, Y and Y1 are independently —H or —C1-6alkyl; or Y1 can be joined together with Z2 to form a fused ring system.
However, continuing discovery of selective small molecule inhibitors of ROMK is still needed for the development of new treatments for hypertension, heart failure, edematous states and related disorders. The compounds of Formula I and salts thereof of this invention are selective inhibitors of the ROMK channel and could be used for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure and other conditions where treatment with a diuretic or natriuretic would be beneficial.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides compounds of Formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of Formula I are inhibitors of the ROMK (Kir1.1) channel. As a result, the compounds of Formula I could be used in methods of treatment, inhibition or amelioration of one or more disease states that could benefit from inhibition of ROMK. The compounds of this invention could be used in methods of treatment which comprise administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula I to a patient in need of a diuretic and/or natriuretic agent. Therefore, the compounds of Formula I could be valuable pharmaceutically active compounds for the therapy, prophylaxis or both of medical conditions, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart failure as well as chronic kidney disease, and conditions associated with excessive salt and water retention. The compounds of this invention could further be used in combination with other therapeutically effective agents, including but not limited to, other drugs which are useful for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure and conditions associated with excessive salt and water retention. The invention furthermore relates to processes for preparing compounds of Formula I, and pharmaceutical compositions which comprise compounds of Formula I. These and other aspects of the invention will be evident from the description contained herein.

All structural Formulas, embodiments and classes thereof described herein include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds defined therein.
As used herein except if noted otherwise, “alkyl” is intended to include both branched- and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. Commonly used abbreviations for alkyl groups are used throughout the specification. For example the term “C1-6 alkyl” (or “C1-C6 alkyl”), means linear or branched chain alkyl groups, including all isomers, having the specified number of carbon atoms and includes all of the hexyl and pentyl isomers as well as n-, iso-, sec- and tert-butyl (butyl, s-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl; Bu=butyl), n- and i-propyl (Pr=propyl), ethyl (Et) and methyl (Me). “Cycloalkyl” is a cyclized alkyl ring having the indicated number of carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.
“Halo” means —F, —Cl, —Br, or —I. Fluoro or chloro are preferred.
Unless expressly depicted or described otherwise, variables depicted in a structural formula with a “floating” bond, such as Rc, are permitted on any available carbon atom in the ring to which the variable is attached. When a moiety is noted as being “optionally substituted” in Formula I or any embodiment thereof, it means that Formula I or the embodiment thereof encompasses compounds that contain the noted substituent (or substituents) on the moiety and compounds that do not contain the noted substituent (or substituents) on the moiety.
Reference to the compounds of Formula I herein encompasses those compounds and all embodiments and classes thereof. Reference to the compounds of this invention as those of a specific formula or embodiment or embodiments thereof, or any other generic structural formula or specific compound described or claimed herein, is intended to encompass the specific compound or compounds falling within the scope of the Formula or embodiment, including salts thereof, particularly pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates (including hydrates) of such compounds and solvated salt forms thereof, where such forms are possible, unless specified otherwise.
The compounds of Formula I may have one or more chiral (asymmetric) centers. The present invention encompasses all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I. Centers of asymmetry that are present in the compounds of Formula I can all independently of one another have (R) or (S) configuration. When bonds to a chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the structural Formulas of the invention, or when a compound name is recited without an (R) or (S) chiral designation for a chiral carbon, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of each such chiral carbon, and hence each enantiomer or diastereomer and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the Formula or by the name. The production of specific stereoisomers or mixtures thereof may be identified in the Examples where such stereoisomers or mixtures were obtained, but this in no way limits the inclusion of all stereoisomers and mixtures thereof from being within the scope of this invention.
The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers, for example mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in all ratios. Thus, enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form, both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cis/trans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by separation of a mixture by customary methods, for example by chromatography or crystallization, by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at an intermediate step during the synthesis of a compound of Formula I or it can be done on a final racemic product. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing a stereogenic center of known configuration. Alternatively, absolute stereochemistry may be determined by Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy analysis. Where compounds of this invention are capable of tautomerization, all individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are included in the scope of this invention. The present invention includes all such isomers, as well as salts, solvates (which includes hydrates) and solvated salts of such racemates, enantiomers, diastereomers and tautomers and mixtures thereof.
In the compounds of Formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of Formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (1H) and deuterium (2H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within Formula I can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and/or intermediates.
When the compounds of Formula I contain one or more acidic or basic groups the invention also includes the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Thus, the compounds of Formula I which contain acidic groups can be used according to the invention as, for example but not limited to, alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or as ammonium salts. Examples of such salts include but are not limited to sodium salts, potassium salts, calcium salts, magnesium salts or salts with ammonia or organic amines such as, for example, ethylamine, ethanolamine, triethanolamine or amino acids. Compounds of Formula I which contain one or more basic groups, i.e. groups which can be protonated, can be used according to the invention in the form of their acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids as, for example but not limited to, salts with hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, benzenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acids, oxalic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid, diethylacetic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, sulfaminic acid, phenylpropionic acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic acid, isonicotinic acid, citric acid, adipic acid, etc. If the compounds of Formula I simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule the invention also includes, in addition to the salt forms mentioned, inner salts or betaines (zwitterions). Salts can be obtained from the compounds of Formula I by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art, for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant, or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of Formula I which, owing to low physiological compatibility, are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but which can be used, for example, as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
Furthermore, compounds of the present invention may exist in amorphous form and/or one or more crystalline forms, and as such all amorphous and crystalline forms and mixtures thereof of the compounds of Formula I are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds of the instant invention may form solvates with water (i.e., a hydrate) or common organic solvents. Such solvates and hydrates, particularly the pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates, of the instant compounds are likewise encompassed within the scope of this invention, along with un-solvated and anhydrous forms.
Any pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug modification of a compound of this invention which results in conversion in vivo to a compound within the scope of this invention is also within the scope of this invention. For example, esters can optionally be made by esterification of an available carboxylic acid group or by formation of an ester on an available hydroxy group in a compound. Similarly, labile amides can be made. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters or amides of the compounds of this invention may be prepared to act as pro-drugs which can be hydrolyzed back to an acid (or —COO— depending on the pH of the fluid or tissue where conversion takes place) or hydroxy form particularly in vivo and as such are encompassed within the scope of this invention. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug modifications include, but are not limited to, —C1-6alkyl esters and —C1-6alkyl substituted with phenyl esters.
Accordingly, the compounds within the generic structural formulas, embodiments and specific compounds described and claimed herein encompass salts, all possible stereoisomers and tautomers, physical forms (e.g., amorphous and crystalline forms), solvate and hydrate forms thereof and any combination of these forms, as well as the salts thereof, pro-drug forms thereof, and salts of pro-drug forms thereof, where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.
The compounds of Formula I according to the invention are inhibitors of ROMK, and therefore could be used as diuretic and/or natriuretic agents. ROMK inhibitors may be used to help to increase urination and increase urine volume and also to prevent or reduce reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys leading to increased excretion of sodium and water. Therefore, the compounds could be used for treatment or prophylaxis or both of disorders that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium from the body. Accordingly, the compounds of this invention could be used in a method for inhibiting ROMK comprising administering a compound of Formula I in a ROMK-inhibitory effective amount to a patient in need thereof. This also encompasses the use of the compounds for inhibiting ROMK in a patient comprising administering a compound of claim 1 in a therapeutically effective amount to a patient in need of diueresis, natriuresis or both. The inhibition of ROMK by the compounds of Formula I can be examined, for example, in the Thallium Flux Assay described below. Moreover, this invention also relates to the use of the compounds of Formula I or salts thereof to validate in vitro assays, for example but not limited to the Thallium Flux Assay described herein.
The compounds of this invention could be used in a method for causing diuresis, natriuresis or both, comprising administering a compound of Formula I in a therapeutically effective amount to a patient in need thereof. Therefore, the compounds of Formula I of this invention could be used in methods for treatment of, prevention of or reduction of risk for developing medical conditions that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium, such as but not limited to one or more of hypertension, such as essential hypertension (also known as primary or idiopathic hypertension) which is a form of hypertension for which no cause can be found, heart failure (which includes both acute heart failure and chronic heart failure, the latter also known as congestive heart failure) and/or other conditions associated with excessive salt and water retention. The compounds could also be used to treat hypertension which is associated with any of several primary diseases, such as renal, pulmonary, endocrine, and vascular diseases, including treatment of patients with medical conditions such as heart failure and/or chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, the compounds of Formula I could be used in methods for treatment of, prevention of or reduction of risk for developing one or more disorders such as pulmonary hypertension, particularly pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), cardiovascular disease, edematous states, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, post-operative volume overload, endothelial dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, stable and unstable angina pectoris, thromboses, restenosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac insufficiency, pulmonary hypertonia, atherosclerosis, hepatic cirrhosis, ascitis, pre-eclampsia, cerebral edema, nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney insufficiency, chronic kidney insufficiency (also referred to as chronic kidney disease, or more generally as renal impairment), acute tubular necrosis, hypercalcemia, idiopathic edema, Dent's disease, Meniere's disease, glaucoma, benign intracranial hypertension, and other conditions for which a diuretic or natriuretic or both would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit. The compounds of the invention may be administered to a patient having, or at risk of having, one or more conditions for which a diuretic or natriuretic or both would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit such as those described herein.
The compounds of Formula I may potentially have reduced liabilities (for example, hypo- or hyperkalemia, new onset of diabetes, dyslipidemia, etc.) over currently used clinical agents. Also the compounds may have reduced risk for diuretic tolerance, which can be a problem with long-term use of loop diuretics.
In general, compounds that are ROMK inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which, when tested, have an IC50 of 5 μM or less, preferably 1 μM or less, and more preferably 0.25 μM or less, in the Thallium Flux Assay, described in more detail further below.
The dosage amount of the compound to be administered depends on the individual case and is, as is customary, to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus, it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated, and also on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated, on the efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used, on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic, or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of Formula I. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the compound will be administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient, including a course of therapy lasting days, months, years or the life of the patient.
In general, a daily dose of approximately 0.001 to 100 mg/kg, preferably 0.001 to 30 mg/kg, in particular 0.001 to 10 mg/kg (in each case mg per kg of bodyweight) is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose is preferably administered in a single dose or can be divided into several, for example two, three or four individual doses, and may be, for example but not limited to, 0.1 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, 1 mg, 1.25 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 175 mg, 200 mg, etc., on a daily basis. In some cases, depending on the potency of the compound or the individual response, it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the given daily dose. Furthermore, the compound may be formulated for immediate or modified release such as extended or controlled release.
The term “patient” includes animals, preferably mammals and especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prophylaxis or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk for developing said disease or medical condition or developing long-term complications from a disease or medical condition.
The term therapeutically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. A prophylactically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The terms “preventing,” “prevention,” “prophylactic” and derivatives of these terms as used herein refer to administering a compound to a patient before the onset of clinical symptoms of a condition not yet present in the patient. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., for treatment of hypertension, and a prophylactically effective amount, e.g., for prevention or reduction of risk of myocardial infarction or prevention or reduction of risk for complications related to hypertension.
In the methods of treatment of this invention, the ROMK inhibitors may be administered via any suitable route of administration such as, for example, orally, parenterally, or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous (IV), intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Oral formulations are preferred for treatment of chronic indications such as hypertension or chronic heart failure, particularly solid oral dosage units such as pills, tablets or capsules, and more particularly tablets. IV dosing is preferred for acute treatment, for example for the treatment of acute heart failure.
This invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is comprised of one or more excipients or additives. An excipient or additive is an inert substance used to formulate the active drug ingredient. For oral use, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention containing the active ingredient may be in forms such as pills, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. The excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, mannitol, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.
Pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other customary additives, for example but not limited to, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, dispersants, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, buffer substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants. Oral immediate-release and time-controlled release dosage forms may be employed, as well as enterically coated oral dosage forms. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques for aesthetic purposes, to mask taste or for other reasons. Coatings can also be used to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water or miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.
Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose.
The instant invention also encompasses a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also encompassed is the pharmaceutical composition which is made by combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Furthermore, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for inhibiting ROMK, for causing diuresis and/or natriuresis, and/or for treating, preventing or reducing the risk for any of the medical conditions described herein, in dosage amounts described herein.
The amount of active compound of Formula I and/or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical composition may be, for example but not limited to, from about 0.1 mg to 1 g, particularly 0.1 mg to about 200 mg, more particularly from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg, and even more particularly from about 0.1 to about 50 mg, per dose on a free acid/free base weight basis, but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical composition, potency of the active ingredient and/or the medical condition being treated, it could also be lower or higher. Pharmaceutical compositions usually comprise about 0.5 to about 90 percent by weight of the active compound on a free acid/free base weight basis.
The compounds of Formula I inhibit ROMK. Due to this property, apart from use as pharmaceutically active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine, they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as aid for biochemical investigations in which such an effect on ROMK is intended, and also for diagnostic purposes, for example in the in vitro diagnosis of cell samples or tissue samples. The compounds of Formula I can also be employed as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutically active compounds.
One or more additional pharmacologically active agents may be administered in combination with a compound of Formula I. The additional active agent (or agents) is intended to mean a medicinal compound that is different from the compound of Formula I, and which is a pharmaceutically active agent (or agents) that is active in the body, including pro-drugs, for example esterified forms, that convert to pharmaceutically active form after administration, and also includes free-acid, free-base and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said additional active agents when such forms are sold commercially or are otherwise chemically possible. Generally, any suitable additional active agent or agents, including but not limited to anti-hypertensive agents, additional diuretics, anti-atherosclerotic agents such as a lipid modifying compound, anti-diabetic agents and/or anti-obesity agents may be used in any combination with the compound of Formula I in a single dosage formulation (a fixed dose drug combination), or may be administered to the patient in one or more separate dosage formulations which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents (co-administration of the separate active agents).

Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are described in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials and intermediates are purchased, made from known procedures, or as otherwise illustrated. Some frequently applied routes to the compounds of Formula I are also described by the Schemes as follows. In some cases the order of carrying out the steps of reaction schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products. In the following Schemes, the “R” substituents correspond to the substituents defined in Formula I at the same positions on the structures; “P” is used to denote a protective group, for example ethyl or methyl ester to protect the carboxylic acid; and the dashed line represents the optional presence of a bond.
Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are described in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials and intermediates are purchased from commercial sources, made from known procedures, or are otherwise illustrated. In some cases the order of carrying out the steps of the reaction schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products.
One method for the preparation of the compounds of the Formula I is detailed in Scheme 1. According to the Scheme, aminoesters 1 are subjected to reductive alkylation with aldehydes or ketones 2 using any of a variety of reagents such as sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, or Ti(O-iPr)4, followed by sodium borohydride. The resulting amines 3a can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acids 4a in a variety of ways depending upon what the protective group (P) is (Greene, T.; Wuts, P. G. M. protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y. 1991). For example tert-butyl esters can be treated with an acid such as TFA, benzyl esters can by subjected to hydrogenolysis using hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon, and methyl or ethyl esters can be hydrolyzed by treatment with a base such as LiOH, NaOH, or KOH. Then aromatic or heterocyclic amines 5 (H2N—R1) are coupled with carboxylic acids 4a, to afford amides of the Formula Ia. Such amide coupling reactions can be conducted using numerous experimental conditions known to the chemist. For example, conversion of the carboxylic acid to an acid chloride followed by treatment with amines 5 often in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine can afford amides Ia. Or coupling of the carboxylic acid 4a and amine 5 can be achieved using one of many amide coupling reagents such as EDCI, HBTU or HATU to afford compounds of the Formula Ia.
Alternatively, compounds of the Formula I (Ib) can be prepared according to Scheme 2. As illustrated, amines 1 are combined with epoxides 6, often with heating, to afford hydroxyamines 3b. The hydroxyamines 3b are hydrolyzed (4b) and coupled to amines 5 in an analogous fashion as described in Scheme 1 to afford the compounds of the Formula Ib.
Another option for preparation of compounds of the Formula I (Ia or Ib) is illustrated in Scheme 3. In this case, carboxylic acids 7 are coupled to aryl and heterocyclic amines 5 to afford amides 8. This can be achieved using one of many amide coupling reagents such as EDCI, HBTU or HATU to afford amides 8. The amine protective group (for example in this illustration, Boc, but other protective groups known to the chemist can be substituted) is then removed to afford aminoamides 9. In the case of a Boc protective group this is accomplished under acidic conditions, for example, with HCl or trifluoroacetic acid. Aminoamides 9 are subjected to reductive alkylation with aldehydes or ketones 2 using any of a variety of reagents such as sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, or Ti(O-iPr)4, followed by sodium borohydride to afford compounds of the Formula Ia. Alternatively, aminoamides 9 are combined with epoxides 6, generally with heating, to afford compounds of the Formula Ib.
In instances where R2 is alkyl, compounds of the Formula Ia or Ib can be prepared as outlined in Scheme 4. Intermediate 8a (prepared as described in Scheme 3) is treated with a base, such as sodium hydride, in a solvent such as dimethyl formamide, to afford tertiary amides 8b. Tertiary amides 8b can then be carried forward to compounds of the Formula I, in the same fashion as described in Scheme 3.
Intermediates 2 and 6 can be prepared according to Scheme 5. According to the Scheme, bromobenzolactones 10, which are commercially available or prepared as described herein and elsewhere, are converted to the allyl (11) or vinyl (12) intermediates using palladium catalyzed coupling with allyltin reagents or potassium vinyl trifluoroborates, respectively. While bromide 10 is illustrated, as known to the chemist, bromide can be substituted by chloro, iodo, or triflate (among others). Allyl intermediates 11 can be converted to aldehydes and ketones 2 in various ways, including by ozonolysis, followed by treatment with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) or triphenyl phosphine. Vinyl intermediates 12 can be transformed to epoxides 6 in several ways, including by treatment with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA).
The independent synthesis of diastereomers and enantiomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute stereochemistry, or by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy.
The subject compounds may be prepared by modification of the procedures disclosed in the Examples as appropriate. Starting materials are commercially available or made by known procedures or as illustrated
Reactions sensitive to moisture or air were performed under nitrogen or argon using anhydrous solvents and reagents. The progress of reactions was determined by either analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) usually performed with E. Merck pre-coated TLC plates, silica gel 60F-254, layer thickness 0.25 mm or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
Typically the analytical LC-MS system used consisted of a Waters ZQ platform with electrospray ionization in positive ion detection mode with an Agilent 1100 series HPLC with autosampler. The column was usually a Water Xterra MS C18, 3.0×50 mm, 5 μm. The flow rate was 1 mL/min, and the injection volume was 10 μL. UV detection was in the range 210-400 nm. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (water plus 0.06% TFA) and solvent B (acetonitrile plus 0.05% TFA) with a gradient of 100% solvent A for 0.7 min changing to 100% solvent B over 3.75 min, maintained for 1.1 min, then reverting to 100% solvent A over 0.2 min.
Preparative HPLC purifications were usually performed using a mass spectrometry directed system. Usually they were performed on a Waters Chromatography Workstation configured with LC-MS System Consisting of: Waters ZQ single quad MS system with Electrospray Ionization, Waters 2525 Gradient Pump, Waters 2767 Injector/Collector, Waters 996 PDA Detector, the MS Conditions of: 150-750 amu, Positive Electrospray, Collection Triggered by MS, and a Waters Sunfire C-18 5 micron, 30 mm (id)×100 mm column. The mobile phases consisted of mixtures of acetonitrile (10-100%) in water containing 0.1% TFA. Flow rates were maintained at 50 mL/min, the injection volume was 1800 μL, and the UV detection range was 210-400 nm. Mobile phase gradients were optimized for the individual compounds.
Reactions performed using microwave irradiation were normally carried out using an Emrys Optimizer manufactured by Personal Chemistry, or an Initiator manufactured by Biotage.
Concentration of solutions was carried out on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography was usually performed using a Biotage Flash Chromatography apparatus (Dyax Corp.) on silica gel (32-63 mM, 60 Å pore size) in pre-packed cartridges of the size noted. 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 500 MHz spectrometers in CDCl3 solutions unless otherwise noted. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm). Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal reference in CD3Cl solutions, and residual CH3OH peak or TMS was used as internal reference in CD3OD solutions. Coupling constants (J) were reported in hertz (Hz).
Chiral analytical chromatography was usually performed on one of Chiralpak AS, Chiralpak AD, Chiralcel OD, Chiralcel IA, or Chiralcel OJ columns (250×4.6 mm) (Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd.) with noted percentage of either ethanol in hexane (% Et/Hex) or isopropanol in heptane (% IPA/Hep) as isocratic solvent systems. Chiral preparative chromatography was sometimes conducted on one of Chiralpak AS, Chiralpak AD, Chiralcel OD, Ciralcel IA, or Chiralcel OJ columns (20×250 mm) (Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd.) with desired isocratic solvent systems identified on chiral analytical chromatography or by supercritical fluid (SFC) conditions. Alternatively, chiral preparative chromatography was by supercritical fluid (SFC) conditions using one of Chiralpak AS, Chiralpak AD-H, Chiralcel OD-H, Chiralpak IC, or Chiralcel OJ-H columns (250×21.2 mm) (Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd.). Where retention times (or order of elution) are provided in the Examples and Tables, they are not intended to be a definitive characteristic of a particular compound since, as known to those skilled in the art, retention times will vary and the timing and/or order of peak elution may change depending on the chromatographic conditions, such as the column used, the condition of the column, and the solvent system and instruments used. Concentration of solutions was generally carried out on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure Crystallization or recrystallization techniques are intended to describe a purification procedure that was used, but do not imply that the resulting product obtained from the procedure is crystalline.

The following are representative procedures for the preparation of intermediates used to prepare the final products described in the Examples that follow thereafter. These examples are provided for the purpose of further illustration only and are not intended to be limitations on the disclosed invention.
It is understood that a chiral center in a compound may exist in the “S” or “R” stereo-configurations, or as a mixture of both. In many of the examples for intermediate compounds and final compounds, such compounds having a racemic chiral center were separated into individual stereoisomers, for example, referred to as isomer A (or enantiomer A or the like), which generally refers to the observed faster eluting isomer unless stated otherwise, and isomer B (or enantiomer B or the like), which refers to the observed slower eluting isomer unless stated otherwise, and each such isomer may be noted in the example as either the fast or slow eluting isomer. When a single “A” or “B” isomer intermediate is used to prepare a downstream compound, the downstream compound will take the “A” or “B” designation that corresponds to the previously used intermediate. Any Intermediates described below may be referred to herein by their number preceded by “I-.” For illustration, in the example titled “Intermediate 4,” the racemic parent title compound would be referred to as Intermediate 4 (or I-4), and the separated stereoisomers are noted as Intermediates 4A and 4B (or I-4A and I-4B). Except for a defined chiral center that may be present in a parent isomer mixture, absolute stereochemistry (R or S) of each of the separated isomers was not determined, unless specifically described otherwise. An asterisk (*) may be used in a chemical structure drawing that indicates the location of a chiral center.
INTERMEDIATE 1
(1-Oxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-5-yl)acetaldehyde
Step A: 5-(1,3-Dioxolan-2-ylmethyl)-2-benzofuran-1(3H)-one
A three-neck 5 L round bottomed flask equipped with a stir bar, Firestone valve, thermocouple, condenser and heating mantle was charged with tri-t-butyl phosphonium tetrafluoroborate (500 mg, 1.72 mmol), palladium (II) acetate (250 mg, 1.1 mmol) and 5-bromo-2-benzofuran-1(3H)-one (100 g, 470 mmol). DMF (1.88 L) was added to the flask, and the mixture was degassed three times by alternating vacuum and nitrogen purge. Commercially available bromo(1,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl)zinc solution (1.03 L, 516 mmol) was added via canula and the mixture was again degassed three times. The mixture was then heated at 85° C. for 5 h. Analysis by HPLC-MS indicated the reaction was not complete. The mixture was stirred at 85° C. for 5 more h. The mixture was then allowed to return to room temperature for overnight. 2-methylTHF (2 L) and brine were added, and the mixture was stirred for 5 min. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted again with 2-methylTHF. The organic layers were combined, washed three times with brine (4 L each), dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography (1.5 kg silica cartridge), eluting with 0-20% ethyl acetate in dichlromethane to afford 5-(1,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl)-2-benzofuran-1 (3H)-one.
LC-MS (IE, m/z): 221 [M+1]+.

After 30 minutes, iodomethane (26 μL, 0.401 mmol) was added and the reaction was allowed to warm to ambient temperature. Upon completion, the reaction mixture was quenched with water and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3×10 mL). The combined organic layers were then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified via MPLC (0-100% EtOAc/Hex gradient) to afford tert-butyl 4-[isothiazol-5-yl(methyl)carbamoyl]piperidine-1-carboxylate. LC-MS (M+H)+326.

To a solution of tert-butyl 4-[isothiazol-5-yl(methyl)carbamoyl]piperidine-1-carboxylate in MeOH was added an excess amount of 4 N HCl in dioxane solution. After addition, the reaction was allowed to stir at ambient temperature for one hour and then concentrated in vacuo to afford the title compound, which was used without further purification.
Step D: 1-[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-methyl-1-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-5-yl)ethyl]-N-(isothiazol-5-yl)-N-methylpiperidine-4-carboxamide hydrochloride
N-(isothiazol-5-yl)-N-methyl-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-6-carboxamide hydrochloride was diluted in EtOH and treated with triethylamine (5 equivalents) for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, 4-methyl-5-[(2R)-oxiran-2-yl]-2-benzofuran-1(3H)-one (1 equivalent) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 15 hours. Once cooled, the reaction was concentrated in vacuo, then purified via preperative TLC to afford the title compound as its free base. The free base was then treated with excess 1N HCl in Et2O solution to afford the HCl salt of the title compound after removal of solvents under vacuum. LC-MS (M+H)+416.
The following compounds in Table 6 were made in a similar fashion as described for 1-[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-methyl-1-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-5-yl)ethyl]-N-(isothiazol-5-yl)-N-methylpiperidine-4-carboxamide (free base) and its hydrochloride salt (Example 41), starting with 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid using the indicated commercially available or known amines as coupling partners, and alkylation of the secondary amides with iodomethane or other alkyl halides.

Step A: tert-butyl 6-(isothiazol-5-ylcarbamoyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-3-carboxylate
To a solution of 3-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-6-carboxylic acid (182 mg, 0.799 mmol, 3 mL DMF) was added HATU. In a separate flask, triethylamine (390 μL, 2.80 mmol) was added to a solution of isothiazol-5-amine (80 mg, 0.799 mmol, 3 mL DMF). Both solutions were allowed to stir at ambient temperature for 15 minutes and then combined. After 2 hours, the reaction mixture was quenched with water and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3×10 mL). The combined organic layers were then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified via MPLC (0-100% EtOAc/Hex gradient) to afford the title compound. (M+H)+310.
Step B: N-(isothiazol-5-yl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-6-carboxamide hydrochloride
To a solution of tert-butyl 6-(isothiazol-5-ylcarbamoyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-3-carboxylate (247 mg, 0.799 mmol, 3 mL MeOH) was added an excess amount of a 4 N HCl in dioxane solution. After addition, the reaction was allowed to stir at ambient temperature for one hour and then concentrated in vacuo to afford title compound which was used without further purification.

After 10 minutes, 4-methyl-5-[(2R)-oxiran-2-yl]-2-benzofuran-1 (3H)-one (85 mg, 0.448 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 15 hours. Once cooled, the reaction was concentrated in vacuo, purified via prep TLC (ethyl acetate/acetonitrile/methanol/IPA—80/10/8/2) to afford the title compound as a free base. Treatment with excess 1N HCl in Et2O solution afforded the title compound as its hydrochloride salt. (M+H)+ 400. Since the starting 3-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-6-carboxylic acid has trans stereochemistry the title compound is also the trans isomer.
The following compounds in Table 8 were made in a similar fashion as described for 3-[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-methyl-1-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-5-yl)ethyl]-N-(isothiazol-5-yl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-6-carboxamide hydrochloride (Example 54) starting with 3-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-6-carboxylic acid using commercially available or known amines as coupling partners.

THALLIUM FLUX ASSAY
Cell Culture Conditions—HEK293 cells stably expressing hROMK (hKir1.1) were grown at 37° C. in a 10% CO2 humidified incubator in complete growth media: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids, Penicillin/Streptomycin/Glutamine, G418 and FBS. At >80% confluency, aspirate the media from the flask and rinse with 10 mL Calcium/Magnesium-free PBS. Add 5 mL of 1× trypsin (prepared in Ca/Mg Free PBS) to T-225 flask and return flask to 37° C./CO2 incubator for 2-3 minutes. To dislodge the cell, gently bang the side of the flask with your hand. Triturate the cells completely and then transfer the cells to 25 mL complete media. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm for 6 min followed by resuspension in complete growth media and determine cell concentration. For typical re-seeding, 4E6 cells/T-225 flask will attain >80% confluency in 4 days. Under ideal growth conditions and appropriate tissue culture practices, this cell line is stable for 40-45 passages.

Step Protocol
1. Seed HEK-hKir1.1 cells (50 μl at 20,000 cells/well) in 384-well PDL coated Microplates
2. Allow cells to adhere overnight in humidified 37° C./10% CO2 incubator
3. Completely remove cell growth media from microplate and replace with 25 μl loading buffer
4. Incubate Microplate at room temperature, protected from light, for 90 min
5. Remove loading buffer and replace with 25 μl 1× Assay Buffer±test compound.
6. Incubate microplate at room temperature, protected from light, for 30 min
7. At FLIPR-Tetra 384: Add stimulant (Thallium/Potassium) solution to microplate and monitor fluorescence. Excitation=400 nm, Emission=460 & 580 nm. Collect data for ˜10 min.
Data Calculation—The fluorescence intensity of wells containing 3 μM of a standard control ROMK inhibitor of the present invention is used to define the ROMK-sensitive component of thallium flux. Fluorescence in the presence of test compounds is normalized to control values to provide % fluorescence change. IC50 values represent the concentration of compound that inhibits 50% of the ROMK thallium flux signal.
