TECHNICAL FIELD
Background Art
Various protein kinases are present in vivo and are known to be involved in a wide range of functional regulations. RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase identified as one of the proto-oncogenes. RET binds to the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and GDNF receptor to form a complex, which enables RET to perform physiological functions through intracellular phosphorylation signaling (Non-patent Literature 1). A study reports that in normal tissues, RET contributes to kidney development and neurogenesis during fetal life (Non-patent Literature 2). Some studies indicate that in cancers, such as lung cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, pancreas cancer, and prostate cancer, the translocation, mutation, or overexpression of the RET gene enhances its activation to thereby contribute to cell growth, tumor formation, or tissue infiltration (Non-patent Literature 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). In addition, RET is known to be an adverse prognostic factor of cancer, as indicated in some reports that the translocation of RET and its enhanced activation level are also inversely correlated with prognosis in cancer (Non-patent Literature 9, 10, 11, and 12).
Therefore, an inhibitor capable of inhibiting RET activity is thought to be useful as a therapeutic agent for diseases associated with abnormally enhanced RET signaling pathways.
It is expected, for example, that in cancers involving translocated, mutated, and overexpressed RET genes, the administration of a medicament capable of specifically inhibiting RET will selectively and intensively suppress the proliferation of cancer cells and contribute to the treatment, life prolongation, and improvement in quality of life of cancer patients.
As an example of such compounds having RET inhibitory activity, PP1 is known (Non-patent Literature 13). PP1 is known to exhibit high inhibitory activity against not only RET but also SRC (Non-patent Literature 14), c-Kit, Bcr-Abl (Non-patent Literature 15 and 16), and others. For example, as side effects, the inhibition of SRC may lead to abnormally enhanced bone formation, and the inhibition of LCK may suppress T cells (Non-patent Literature 17 and 18). Since multikinase inhibitors inhibit, not only RET but also various signaling pathways, inhibiting cell growth and other functions, the inhibitors raise concerns about possible various side effects, which may require dose reduction or drug holidays, thus leading to insufficient. RET inhibitory activity. From the standpoint of side effect reduction, there has been a demand for a RET inhibitor having high inhibitory activity against RET while exhibiting low inhibitory activity against other kinases.

RET is known as an oncogene and known to be activated by the translocation, mutation, or overexpression of the RET gene in many types of cancer (Non-patent Literature 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). Thus, the compound or a salt thereof of the present invention, both of which have a high RET inhibitory activity, is useful as an agent for preventing and/or treating cancer.
Further, the compound or a salt thereof of the present invention selectively and potently inhibits RET, rather than other kinases, such as SRC and LCK; therefore, side effects can be reduced, and improvement in safety can be expected.
Moreover, the compound or a salt thereof of the present invention is advantageous in that it has excellent stability in hepatic microsomes, excellent exposure in the blood can be expected, and there is no concern about Cyp inhibition.

Test Example 1
Measurement of RET Inhibitory Activity (In Vitro)
Regarding the conditions for measurement of in vitro is activity of compounds against RET kinase activity, the website of AnaSpec states that Srctide (GEEPLYWSFPAKKK) corresponds to the substrate peptide for reaction to measure RET kinase activity. Thus, the amino acid sequence was partly modified and biotinylated to prepare biotinylated peptides (biotin-EEPLYWSFPAKKK). The purified recombinant human RET protein used in the test was purchased from Cana Biosciences, Inc.
To measure the inhibitory activity, first, the compounds of the present invention were individually diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stepwise. Subsequently, RET protein, the substrate peptide (final concentration: 250 nM), magnesium chloride (final concentration: 10 mM), ATP (the final concentration: 10 μm), and a solution of the compound of the present invention in DMSO (final concentration of DMSO: 2.5%) were added to a buffer for kinase reaction (13.5 mM Tris, pH of 7.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.009% Tween-20). Each of the mixtures was incubated at 25° C. for 100 minutes to perform kinase reaction. EDTA was then added thereto to give a final concentration of 24 mM so that the reaction was terminated. A detection solution containing Eu-labeled antiphosphotyrosine antibody PT66 (PerkinElmer) and SureLight APC-SA (PerkinElmer) was added thereto, and each mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours or more. Finally, the intensity of fluorescence under the excitation light with a wavelength of 337 nm was measured with a PHERAstar FS (BMG Labtech) at the two wavelengths of 620 nm and 665 nm. The phosphorylation level was calculated from the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at the two wavelengths, and the compound concentration at which phosphorylation was inhibited by 50% was defined as the IC50 value (nM).
Table 15 shows IC50 (nM) of the RET (WT) inhibitory activity of the compounds of the Examples and compounds 1 to 3 of the Comparative Examples.
Vandetanib is known to have a high inhibitory activity against RET and exhibit a high antitumor effect (e.g., Carlomagno F. Cancer Res. 2002 Dec. 15; 62(24): 7284-90). The compounds of the present invention were found to exhibit in vitro RET inhibitory activity at an equivalent or higher level than Vandetanib.

Test Example 2
RET Inhibitory Selectivity (In Vitro) over Other Kinase Inhibitory Activity
1) RET Inhibitory Activity Measurement
RET inhibitory activity was measured in the same manner as in Test Example 1.
2) SRC Inhibitory Activity Measurement
Retarding the conditions for measurement of in vitro inhibitory activity of compounds against SRC kinase activity, the price list of LabChip-series consumable reagents of PerkinElmer shows that FL-Peptide 4 corresponds to the substrate peptide for reaction to measure SRC kinase activity. Thus, FL-Peptide 4 was used as a substrate. The purified recombinant human SRC protein used in the test was purchased from Carna Biosciences, Inc.
To measure the inhibitory activity, first, the compounds of the present invention were individually diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stepwise. Subsequently, SRC protein, FL-Peptide 4 (final concentration: 1.5 μM), magnesium chloride (final concentration: 10 mM), ATP (final concentration: 15 μM), and a solution of the compound of the present invention in DMSO (final concentration of DMSO: 5%) were added to a reaction buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH of 7.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.003% Brij35, 0.04% Tween-20) containing a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (PhosSTOP, Roche) and a protease inhibitor cocktail (complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche) at recommended concentrations. Each mixture was incubated at 30° C. for 90 minutes to perform kinase reaction. EDTA diluted with a separation buffer available from PerkinElmer (final concentration: 30 mM) was then added thereto to terminate the kinase reaction. Finally, non-phosphorylated substrate peptides (S) and phosphorylated peptides (P) were separated and detected by microchannel capillary electrophoresis using LabChip EZ Reader II (PerkinElmer). The phosphorylation level was calculated from the height of the peaks of S and P, and the compound concentration at which phosphorylation was inhibited by 50% was defined as IC50 value (nM).
3) LCK Inhibitory Activity Measurement
Regarding the conditions for measurement of in vitro inhibitory activity of compounds against LCK kinase activity, the website of AnaSpec states that Srctide (GEEPLYWSFPAKKK) corresponds to the substrate peptide for reaction to measure LCK kinase activity. Thus, the amino acid sequence was partly modified and biotinylated to prepare biotinylated peptides (biotin-EEPLYWSFPAKKK). The purified recombinant human LCK protein used in the test was purchased from Carna Biosciences, Inc.
To measure the inhibitory activity, first, the compounds of the present invention were individually diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stepwise. Subsequently, LCK protein, the substrate peptides (final concentration: 250 nM), magnesium chloride (final concentration: 10 mM), ATP (final concentration: 50 μM), and a solution of the compound of the present invention in DMSO (final concentration of DMSO: 5%) were added to a buffer for kinase reaction (13.5 mM Tris, pH of 7.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.009% Tween-20). Each mixture was incubated at 25° C. for 60 minutes to perform kinase reaction. EDTA was then added thereto to give a final concentration of 40 mM so that the reaction was terminated. A detection solution containing Eu-labeled antiphosphotyrosine antibody PT66 (PerkinElmer) and SureLight APC-SA (PerkinElmer) was added thereto, and each mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours or more. Finally, the intensity of fluorescence under the excitation light with a wavelength of 337 nm was measured with a PHERAstar FS (BMG Labtech) at the two wavelengths of 620 nm and 665 nm. The phosphorylation level was calculated from the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at the two wavelengths, and the compound concentration at which phosphorylation was inhibited by 50% was defined as IC50 value (nM).
4) RET Inhibitory Selectivity
From the values obtained in sections 1) and 3) above, SRC inhibitory activity TC50 (nM)/RET inhibitory activity IC50 (nM) and LCK inhibitory activity IC50 (nM)/RET inhibitory activity IC50 (nM) were calculated, and the RET inhibitory selectivity of the tested compounds was examined.  TABLE 16

Test Example 3
Evaluation of Cell Growth Inhibitory Effect on Tumor Cell Carrying RET Gene Defect
An in vitro cell-killing test was performed on TT cells (a human thyroid cancer line carrying RET activating mutation (C634W)).
A suspension of TT cells in a 10% FBS-containing Ham's F12K (Kaighn's) medium (produced by Life Technologies Japan) was inoculated into each well of a 96-well flat-bottomed microplate in an amount of 5×103 (0.15 mL) for each well, and cultured in an incubator containing 5% carbon dioxide at 37° C. overnight (day 0). The compounds of the present invention were individually dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to give a concentration of 10 mM, and further diluted with a 10% FBS-containing RPMI1640 medium (produced by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) so that the compounds of the present invention respectively had a final concentration of 40, 12, 4, 1.2, 0.4, 0.12, 0.04, and 0.012 μm. The compounds of different concentrations were individually added to wells of the TT cell-containing culture plate described above in an amount of 0.05 mL for each well (day 1), and cultured in an incubator containing 5% carbon dioxide at 37° C. for 7 days. After culture (day 8), 0.1 mL of the medium was removed from each well, and 0.1 mL of a CellTiter Glo 2.0 reagent (Promega Corporation), which is an intracellular ATP luminescence detection reagent, was added thereto, followed by shaking for 1 minute. After shaking, each culture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes, and the chemiluminescence was measured with a luminometer to use it as an index of the number of viable cells. The growth rate from day 1 of the compounds with different concentrations was calculated from the following equations, depending on the value of Tday 8and Cday 1, to determine the concentration (GI50 (μM)) of the tested compounds capable of suppressing cell growth by 50%.

Evaluation of Antitumor Effect on In Vivo Model Having TT (Human Thyroid Cancer Cell Line Carrying RET Activating Mutation) Cells Subcutaneously Implanted
Human thyroid cancer cell lines (TT) were subcutaneously implanted into the right chest of 6- to 7-week-old BALB/cA Jcl-nu/nu male mice. About 3 weeks after the cell implantation, the length (mm) and the width (mm) of tumors found in mouse bodies were measured. After their tumor volume (tumor volume: TV) was calculated, the mice were divided into groups (n=5 or 6) so that the groups had a substantially equal mean TV. The day on which the mice were divided into groups was determined to be the “grouping day” (day 0 or 1).
Test solutions containing the compounds of the present invention were prepared at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day, and orally administered to the mice for consecutive 14 days (the first administration day is day 1). A control group was administered a solvent (0.5% HPMC/0.1N HCl).
To determine the index of the antitumor effect, TV of each drug-administrated group was measured on day 15, and the tumor volume on day 15 relative to the tumor volume on the grouping day (day 0 or 1) (relative tumor volume: RTV) and T/C (%) were calculated from the following equations to evaluate the antitumor effect. When a group administered any of the compounds of the present invention (test-solution-administered group) exhibited a statistically significantly smaller mean RTV (Dunnett's test or Student's t-test, p<0.05) than the mean RTV of the control group, an antitumor effect was determined to be present. FIGS. 1 and 2 and Tables 19 and 20 show the results. In the figures, the symbol “*” indicates a statistically significant difference.

Evaluation of Stability in Hepatic Microsome
Solutions of the tested compounds in DMSO/acetonitrile (the final concentration of each tested compound was 1 μM, the final concentration of DMSO was 0.01%, and the final concentration of acetonitrile was 1%) were individually added to a hepatic microsome mixture solution (mouse hepatic microsome with a final concentration of 0.25 mg/mL, a potassium phosphate buffer with a final concentration of 100 mM, and magnesium chloride with a final concentration of 3 mM), and each mixture was pre-incubated at 37° C. for 5 minutes. A NADPH-generating system (glucose-6-phosphate with a final concentration of 10 mM, oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate with a final concentration of 1 mM, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with a final concentration of 1 unit/mL) was added to a portion of each mixture solution, and metabolic reaction was started. After incubation at 37° C. for 30 minutes, a double amount of ethanol was added thereto to terminate the reaction, thereby obtaining post-reaction samples. A double amount of ethanol was added to each of the remaining mixture solutions, and a NADPH-generating system was further added thereto, thereby obtaining pre-reaction samples. The pre-reaction samples and post-reaction samples were centrifuged at 2000×g, and their supernatant was filtered through a glass filter. Each filtrate was then introduced into LC-MS/MS, and MS/MS peaks of the tested compounds were detected. From the ratio of the post-reaction MS/MS peak to the pre-reaction MS/MS peak of the tested compounds, the percentage of the remaining tested compounds (remaining %) was calculated.
The results show that whereas compound 4 of Comparative Examples had a remaining percentage of 0% in any case, the compounds of the present invention or salts thereof described in the Examples had a high remaining percentage. This indicates that the compounds of the present invention or salts thereof are significantly more stable in mouse hepatic microsome than the compound of Comparative Examples.

Evaluation of Oral Absorption
The compounds of the present invention were suspended or dissolved in 0.5% HPMC and 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and orally administered to BALB/cA mice. At a time point of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after the oral administration, the blood of the mice was collected from their ocular fundus or facial vein, and centrifuged to obtain plasma. The concentration of the compounds in the obtained plasma was measured by LC-MS/MS, and oral absorption was evaluated.
The results reveal that the plasma concentration of the compounds of the present invention was sufficient, indicating excellent oral absorption.
