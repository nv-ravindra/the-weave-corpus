TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure relates generally to compounds, compositions, and methods for assaying the presence and/or activity of enzymes.
BACKGROUND
Reporter molecules are routinely used to monitor molecular events in the fields of biology, biochemistry, immunology, cell biology and molecular biology. For example, reporter molecules are employed in assays where the levels of the reporter molecule are due to transcription from a specific promoter linked to the reporter molecule. Reporter molecule assays can be used to study biological processes including gene expression, receptor activity, transcription factors, intracellular signaling, mRNA processing, and protein folding. Analysis of reporter molecules that are typically used in such assays includes detection of radioactive isotopes, enzyme activity, fluorescence, or luminescence.
Luminescence in biological assays typically involves the activity of a luminogenic protein. Luminogenic proteins that are useful in assay systems include, but are not limited to, Renilla luciferase, Oplophorus luciferase, Vargula (Cypridina) luciferase, Gaussia luciferase, and aequorin. In a luminescent reaction, the interaction of a luminogenic protein with an appropriate molecule, referred to as a luminophore, produces light as one of the reaction products. The quantity of light produced in the reaction can be measured. This measurement may be used qualitatively to determine if a certain substance or target of interest is or is not present in a sample. This measurement also may be used quantitatively to calculate the concentration of luminogenic protein, luminophore, and/or substance or target of interest in the reaction.
Luminescent reactions can be used to detect very small quantities of a particular analyte, the substance being identified and measured in an assay. For example, luminescent reactions can be used to detect and quantify proteases, lipases, phosphatases, peroxidases, glycosidases, various metabolites such as ATP or NADH, and reporter molecules. Luminescent reactions can also be used to detect and quantify analytes through binding interactions, such as those mediated by antibodies and nucleotide probes. Another application of luminescent reactions is bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), which can determine if two molecules are capable of binding to each other or are co-localized in a cell. Typically, luminescent reactions can be used to detect an analyte present in a sample at less than about 1×10−16 moles, often less than 1×10−19 moles.
Coelenterazines are reporter molecules known to luminesce when acted on by a wide variety of bioluminescent proteins such as marine luciferases. Examples of such marine luciferases include Renilla luciferase, Aequorin, Gaussia luciferase, and Oplophorus luciferase.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Disclosed herein are cell-impermeable pro-substrates. The pro-substrates can be used to measure luminescent enzymes in living cells. Traditional methods for providing substrates to intracellular enzymes have relied on cell permeable pro-substrates that are converted to substrates through the activity of endogenous esterases, reductases or proteases. The approach described here may utilize cell impermeable pro-substrates that provide a sustained release of cell permeable substrate (e.g., coelenterazine, or derivative or analogue thereof, such as furimazine) upon hydrolysis. The cell impermeable substrates may be masked by highly functionalized carbamates that contain an amine base (or nucleophile) and, optionally, one or more charged functional groups. Hydrolysis of the carbamate may be tuned by choice of the appropriate internal base. The internal base and the optional introduced negative charge(s) may maximize substrate solubility and minimize cell permeability. When the protected cell impermeable pro-substrate is added to the cells, it may be deprotected (become cell permeable) by a reaction in the extracellular medium (“self-based catalyzed”), and the substrate (deprotected) may freely diffuse into the cell where it may be utilized by a luminescent enzyme.
The advantages of the disclosed compounds, compositions, and methods include: increased signal stability versus use of unprotected coelenterazine, or derivative or analogue thereof, for kinetic experiments; significant increases in signal intensity versus use of coelenterazine, or derivative or analogue thereof, protected using more traditional approaches; increased solubility versus unprotected coelenterazine, or derivative or analogue thereof, or coelenterazine, or derivative or analogue thereof, protected using more traditional approaches; and decreased cytotoxicity versus unprotected coelenterazine, or derivative or analogue thereof, or coelenterazine, or derivative or analogue thereof, protected using more traditional approaches. As a result of these properties, the disclosed compounds can be used in applications that include reporter gene assays, BRET and protein complementation.

The term “luminescent enzyme” unless specified otherwise, refers to a naturally occurring, recombinant or mutant luminescent enzyme that uses a coelenterazine and/or a coelenterzaine derivative or analogue thereof, as a substrate. The luminescent enzyme, if naturally occurring, may be obtained easily by the skilled person from an organism. If the luminescent enzyme is one that occurs naturally or is a recombinant or mutant luminescent enzyme, i.e. one which retains activity in a luciferase-coelenterazine reaction of a naturally occurring luminescent enzyme, it can be obtained readily from a culture of bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, or the like, transformed to express a nucleic acid encoding the luminescent enzyme. Further, the recombinant or mutant luminescent enzyme can be derived from an in vitro cell-free system using a nucleic acid encoding the luciferase. Suitable luminescent enzymes include luciferases derived from bioluminescent decapods, such as from the Oplophoroidea, e.g. Oplophorus-derived luciferases, marine organisms such as cnidarians (e.g., Renilla luciferase), Aristeidae, Solenoceridae, Luciferidae, Sergestidae, Pasipheidae and Thalassocarididae decapoda families, and photoproteins, such as Aequorin, and variants and mutants of said luciferases.
A “luminescent reaction mixture” contains materials that will allow the luminescent enzyme to generate a light signal, i.e., luminescence. The mixture may also contain the enzyme. The materials needed, and the particular concentrations and/or amounts, of the materials needed to generate a luminescent signal will vary depending on the luminescent enzyme used as well as the type of assay being performed. Often other materials will be added to the solution including: a buffer to maintain the reaction at the proper pH, an additive such as PRIONEX or Bovine serum albumin (BSA) to help maintain enzyme activity, reducing agents, detergents, etc.
As used herein, the term “methylenedioxy” refers to a —OCH2O— group wherein the oxygen atoms of the methylenedioxy are attached to the parent molecular moiety through two adjacent carbon atoms.

As used herein, the term “oxo” refers to a double bonded oxygen (═O) radical wherein the bond partner is a carbon atom. Such a radical can also be thought as a carbonyl group.
The term “peptide” or “polypeptide” refers to a sequence of at least two amino acids. In some embodiments, a peptide may contain no more than 80 amino acids, or no more than 35 amino acids, or no more than 10 amino acids.
The term “saccharide” refers to a sugar or other carbohydrate, especially a simple sugar. It includes both the alpha- and the beta-anomers. The saccharide can be a C6-polyhydroxy compound, typically a C6-pentahydroxy, and often a cyclic glycal. It includes the known simple sugars and their derivatives, as well as polysaccharides with two or more monosaccharide residues. The saccharide can include protecting groups on the hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl groups of the saccharide can be replaced with one or more acetamido, halo or amino groups. Additionally, one or more of the carbon atoms can be oxidized, for example to keto or carbonyl groups. Suitable saccharides include galactose, glucose, glucoronic acid and neurominic acid.
As used herein, the term “sulfonyl” refers to an >S(O)2 group.
A prefix attached to a multi-component substituent only applies to the first component it precedes. To illustrate, the term “alkylcycloalkyl” contains two components: alkyl and cycloalkyl. Thus, the C1-C6-prefix on C1-C6-alkylcycloalkyl means that the alkyl component of the alkylcycloalkyl contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; the C1-C6-prefix does not describe the cycloalkyl component. To illustrate further, the prefix “halo” on haloalkoxyalkyl indicates that only the alkoxy component of the alkoxyalkyl substituent is substituted with one or more halogen radicals. If the halogen substitution may only occur on the alkyl component, the substituent would instead be described as “alkoxyhaloalkyl.”
A substituent is “substitutable” if it comprises at least one carbon or nitrogen atom that is bonded to one or more hydrogen atoms. Thus, for example, hydrogen, halogen, and cyano do not fall within this definition. In addition, a sulfur atom in a heterocyclyl containing such atom is substitutable with one or two oxo substituents.
If a substituent is described as being “substituted”, a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there is more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).
When a substituent is referred to as “unsubstituted” or not referred to as “substituted” or “optionally substituted”, it means that the substituent does not have any substituents. If a substituent is described as being “optionally substituted”, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.
If substituents are described as being “independently selected” from a group, each substituent is selected independent of the other. Each substituent, therefore, may be identical to or different from the other substituent(s).
2. CELL IMPERMEABLE PRO-SUBSTRATES
Compounds of the invention include cell impermeable pro-substrates. The pro-substrates can be used in methods of detecting the presence/absence and/or activity of enzymes in living cells. The cell impermeable pro-substrates may provide a sustained release of cell permeable substrate. The cell impermeable pro-substrates may be converted to a cell permeable substrate by an intramolecular reaction and/or by an intermolecular reaction. The cell impermeable pro-substrates may be in a buffered solution. The cell impermeable pro-substrates may comprise a functional group (e.g., a basic functional group) configured to cleave the cell impermeable moiety of the pro-substrate (e.g., via nucleophilic addition reaction and/or via catalysis of a nucleophilic addition reaction, such as a hydrolysis reaction). The functional group may cleave a cell impermeable moiety via an intramolecular reaction within the same molecule and/or by intermolecular reaction acting on a different pro-substrate molecule. Upon entering the cell, the cell permeable substrate may be acted on by an enzyme such as luciferase. The disclosed pro-substrates may consequently be useful in methods of detecting enzymes.

In certain embodiments, provided is a method for measuring the activity of a promoter in a sample, wherein the promoter is operably linked to a gene encoding a luminescent enzyme. The method includes (a) contacting the sample with the disclosed compound; and (b) determining the activity of the promoter by measuring luminescence of the sample, wherein the sample comprises the promoter. The promoter may be operably linked to the gene via a translational or transcriptional fusion. A biological pathway of interest, for example, may be examined by treating a cell that comprises the promoter, which is operably linked to a gene encoding the luminescent enzyme, with an inducer agent of the pathway. This promoter activity may then be measured and monitored to study any correlation between the activity of the promoter and the pathway of interest, as well as obtain kinetic measurements relating to gene expression (e.g. inducibility, repression and activation).
In some embodiments, the luminescent enzyme, e.g., coelenterazine-utilizing luciferase, may be multiplexed with another enzyme (e.g. a luciferase) that emits light at a different wavelength, e.g., green firefly luciferase, e.g., Photinus pyralis (e.g., Luc2; Promega Corp) or red click beetle luciferase (CHROMA-LUC™; Promega Corp.). For example, if a luminescent enzyme of the present invention is used as a functional reporter, then the green firefly luciferase or red CHROMA-LUC™ luciferase could be used to control for non-specific effects on genetic regulation or to normalize for transfection efficiency. In some embodiments, luminescence generated from the luminescent enzyme (approximately 460 nm) and red CHROMA-LUC™ (approximately 610 nm) can be easily resolved using a luminometer with wavelength-discriminating filters, enabling the measurement of both signals from the same sample. In another example, a luminescent enzyme could be used as a transcriptional reporter and paired with a luciferase that emits light at a different wavelength contained in an assay reagent. In another example, a luminescent enzyme may be used with one or more additional luciferases, where the luminescence of each luciferase may be separately measured through the use of selective enzyme inhibitors. For example, the luminescence of a first luciferase may be measured upon addition of appropriate substrates and buffers, followed by measurement of a second luciferase upon a subsequent addition of appropriate substrates and buffers and one or more inhibitors selective for the first luciferase. In another example, the luciferase contained in an assay reagent may be used for measuring a specific aspect of cellular physiology, for example ATP to estimate cell viability, or caspase activity to estimate cellular apoptosis.
(3) Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)
The disclosed compounds may be used in any method for detecting ligand-protein and/or protein-protein interactions. The cell-permeable substrate, generated from the disclosed compounds, can be used by a luminescent enzyme. In various embodiments, the luminescent enzymes may be used to transfer energy to an energy acceptor. One such method is Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET). With respect to BRET, energy transfer from a bioluminescent donor to a fluorescent acceptor results in a shift in the spectral distribution of the emission of light. This energy transfer may enable real-time monitoring of protein-protein or ligand-protein interaction in vitro or in vivo. In some embodiments, the BRET method may be the NANOLUC®-Mediated Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (NANOBRET®) Assay for ligand-protein and protein-protein interactions. NANOBRET comprises two different methods: 1) using HALOTAG® and NANOLUC® technologies, Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) to detect protein-protein and/or ligand-protein interactions may be achieved with increased signal and decreased spectral overlap; and 2) using NANOLUC fused to a protein of interest and a fluorescent tracer to detect ligand-receptor interaction in living cells.
In some embodiments, the luminescent enzymes used in BRET analysis can be used to determine if two molecules are capable of binding to each other or co-localize in a cell. For example, a luminescent enzyme can be used as a bioluminescence donor molecule which is combined with a molecule or protein of interest to create a first fusion protein. In various embodiments, the first fusion protein contains a luminescent enzyme and a protein of interest. In various embodiments, the first fusion proteins containing the luminescent enzyme can be used in BRET analysis to detect protein/protein interaction in systems including but not limited to cell lysates, intact cells, and living animals. In various embodiments, HALOTAG® can be used as a fluorescent acceptor molecule. In some embodiments, HALOTAG® can be fused to a second protein of interest or to a luminescent enzyme. For example, a luminescent enzyme can be fused to HALOTAG®, expressed in cells or animals, and labeled with a fluorescent HALOTAG® ligand such as HALOTAG® TMR ligand. The fusion can subsequently be excited to fluoresce in the presence of a cell-permeant luminescent enzyme substrate. In some embodiments, BRET may be performed using luminescent enzymes in combination with fluorescent proteins, including but not limited to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) or Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) or fluorescent labels including fluorescein, rhodamine green, Oregon green, or Alexa 488, to name a few non-limiting examples.
(4) Protein Proximity Assays for Live Cells or Lytic Formats
In some embodiments, the disclosed compounds may be used with circularly permuted (CP) or straight split (SS) luminescent enzyme fusion proteins to measure protein proximity. A luminescent enzyme is permuted or split via insertion of a protease substrate amino acid sequence (e.g., TEV) to generate low bioluminescence. The inactive luminescent enzyme is tethered (e.g., via genetic fusion) to a monitor protein. A potential interacting protein is tethered (e.g., via genetic fusion) to a protease (e.g., TEV). When the two monitor proteins interact or are in sufficient proximity (e.g., via a constitutive interaction, a drug stimulus or a pathway response), the luminescent enzyme is cleaved to generate increased bioluminescence activity. The example may be applied to measurements of protein proximity in cells or in biochemical assays.
(5) Protein Complementation Assays
In some embodiments, the disclosed compounds may be used in other methods for detecting ligand-protein and protein-protein interactions or proximity, such as the protein complementation assay (PCA) or enzyme fragmentation assay. Protein complementation assays (PCA) provide a means to detect the interaction of two biomolecules, e.g., polypeptides. PCA utilizes two fragments of the same protein, e.g., enzyme, that when brought into close proximity with each other can reconstitute into a functional, active protein. In some embodiments, the NANOBIT® technology (Promega Corporation) may be used to detect molecular proximity by virtue of the reconstitution of a luminescent enzyme via the binding interaction of enzyme components or subunits. NANOBIT utilizes a non-luminescent peptide (NLPep) and non-luminescent polypeptide (NLPoly) derived from the Oplophorus luciferase variant, NANOLUC luciferase. The NLPep and NLPoly are fused to proteins of interest. If the proteins of interest interact, NLPep and NLPoly interact to reconstitute a full-length Oplphorus luciferase enzyme.
For example, a luminescent enzyme can be separated into two fragments at a site(s) tolerant to separation and each fragment of the separated luminescent enzyme can be fused to one of a pair of polypeptides of interest believed to interact, e.g., FKBP and FRB. If the two polypeptides of interest do in fact interact, the luminescent enzyme fragments, for example, then come into close proximity with each other to reconstitute the functional, active luminescent enzyme. In some embodiments, the activity of the reconstituted luminescent enzyme can then be detected and measured using the disclosed compounds and the cell-permeable substrate. In some embodiments, the split luminescent enzyme can be used in a more general complementation system similar to lac-Z (Langley et al., PNAS 72:1254-1257 (1975)) or ribonuclease S (Levit and Berger, J. Biol. Chem. 251:1333-1339 (1976)). In some embodiments, a luminescent enzyme fragment (designated “A”) known to complement with another luminescent enzyme fragment (“B”) can be fused to a target protein, and the resulting fusion can be monitored via luminescence in a cell or cell lysate containing fragment B. In some embodiments, the source of fragment B could be the same cell (e.g., if the gene for fragment B is integrated into the genome of the cell or is contained on another plasmid within the cell) or it could be a lysate or purified protein derived from another cell. In some embodiments, this same fusion protein (fragment A) could be captured or immobilized using a fusion between fragment B and a polypeptide such as HALOTAG® capable of attachment to a solid support. In some embodiments, luminescence can be used to demonstrate successful capture or to quantify the amount of material captured.
(6) Dimerization Assay
In some embodiments, the disclosed compounds may be used with full-length circularly permuted luminescent enzymes fused to respective binding partners, e.g., FRB and FKBP, and used in a protein complementation-type assay. The key difference between the method disclosed herein and traditional protein complementation is that there was no complementation, but rather there was dimerization of two full length enzymes, e.g., circularly permuted luminescent enzymes.
Briefly, the circularly permuted reporter proteins similarly configured for low activity are fused to both of the fusion protein partners. For example, each fusion partner may be linked to identically structured, permuted reporters. Interaction of the fusion partners brought the permuted reporters into close proximity, thereby allowing reconstitution of a hybrid reporter having higher activity.
(7) Combinations
In certain embodiments, the methods disclosed herein include contacting a sample (e.g., a cell) with a mixture of a cell impermeable pro-substrate and its corresponding cell permeable substrate (see e.g., FIG. 15 ). In certain embodiments, the methods disclosed herein include preincubating a disclosed cell impermeable compounds in an appropriate pH buffer condition or an appropriate nucleophile solution to release cell permeable substrate to an extent, and then contacting the sample (e.g. cells) with the above preincubated solution. In certain embodiments, the methods disclosed herein include contacting a sample with a cell impermeable substrate and a nucleophilic combined configured to react with the carbamate functionality of the cell impermeable substrate to release a cell permeable substrate (e.g., a coelenterazine). In some embodiments, the disclosed compounds and methods may be used to build up the initial brightness of a high-throughput screening operation assay format. Such methods may provide enhanced brightness at an initial sample duration time with sustained release of coelenterazines to the sample.
(8) Sample
The disclosed compounds may be used with samples containing biological components. The sample may comprise cells. The sample may comprise heterogeneous mixtures of components (including intact cells, cell extracts, cell lysates, bacteria, viruses, organelles, and mixtures thereof) or a single component or homogeneous group of components (e.g., natural or synthetic amino acid, nucleic acid or carbohydrate polymers, or lipid membrane complexes). The compounds are generally non-toxic to living cells and other biological components within the concentrations of use.
The sample may include an animal (e.g., a vertebrate), a plant, a fungus, physiological fluid (e.g., blood, plasma, urine, mucous secretions and the like), a cell, a cell lysate, a cell supernatant, or a purified fraction of a cell (e.g., a subcellular fraction). In certain embodiments, the sample may be a cell. In some embodiments, the sample may be a live cell. The cell may be a eukaryotic cell, e.g., yeast, avian, plant, insect or mammalian cells, including but not limited to human, simian, murine, canine, bovine, equine, feline, ovine, caprine or swine cells, or prokaryotic cells, or cells from two or more different organisms, or cell lysates or supernatants thereof. The cells may not have been genetically modified via recombinant techniques (nonrecombinant cells), or may be recombinant cells which are transiently transfected with recombinant DNA and/or the genome of which is stably augmented with a recombinant DNA, or which genome has been modified to disrupt a gene, e.g., disrupt a promoter, intron or open reading frame, or replace one DNA fragment with another. The recombinant DNA or replacement DNA fragment may encode a molecule to be detected by the methods of the invention, a moiety which alters the level or activity of the molecule to be detected, and/or a gene product unrelated to the molecule or moiety that alters the level or activity of the molecule. The cell may or may not express a luciferase. The cells may have been genetically modified via recombinant techniques.

Example 23
The effect of pH on the hydrolysis of the disclosed compounds may be useful for high-throughput screening (HTS). The percent furimazine released in 1 mM of PBI-5455 solutions with different pH values ranging from 5.9 to 7.6 were detected over time using HPLC at 262 nm. FIG. 14 shows that the release of furimazine by hydrolysis of PBI-5455 is pH dependent. These compounds can be used to support HTS operation methods to enhance the initial brightness by adjusting pH or adding an appropriate nucleophile.
Example 24
As shown in Example 23, PBI-5455 is stable in slightly acidic buffer for 10 hrs. The higher the pH, the faster the release. For BRET applications to detect protein-protein and/or ligand-protein interactions, if it is a one-time point reading, the concentration in media could be higher than 100-200 μM. The pH in buffer stock could be utilized to adjust the initial brightness and make it comparable to furimazine and maintain the kinetics of furimazine. FIG. 15 shows a schematic showing an HTS operation using PBI-5455 compared to using furimazine.
