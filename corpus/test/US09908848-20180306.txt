BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
While there are numerous compositions and methods known in the art to treat pain and inflammation, numerous difficulties remain. Most significantly, side effects over long administration periods and/or higher dosages often limit the use of such drugs. For example, certain COX-2 inhibitors are implicated in adverse cardiovascular events and aspirin-type pain medication often increase the risk of intestinal bleeding. In other examples, ibuprofen and acetaminophen tend to negatively impact hepatic function, especially at higher dosages.
Ethanolamides of long-chain fatty acids, usually referred to as N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), are present in numerous lower and higher organisms, and mammals with a wide variety of functions. For example, anandamide, a polyunsaturated fatty acid-type NAE, was demonstrated to have cannabimimetic activity. In contrast, saturated and monounsaturated NAEs are inactive as ligands of cannabinoid receptors. However, such compounds have been reported to possess a variety of other biological activities. For example, N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA), a monounsaturated fatty acid-type NAE, was shown to be anorexic via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), and N-stearoylethanolamine (SEA), a saturated fatty acid-type NAE, to be pro-apoptotic and anorexic.
N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA), the naturally occurring amide of palmitic acid and ethanolamine, is a member of the saturated fatty acid-type NAE family. PEA has been shown to inhibit peripheral inflammation and mast cell degranulation (Mazzari et al., European Journal of Pharmacology 1996, 300, 227-36; Berdishev et al., Life Science 1998, 63, 125-129; D'Agostino et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2007, 322, 1137-1143), as well as to exert antinociceptive effects in rats and mice (Calignano et al., Nature 1998, 394, 277-281; Calignano et al., European Journal of Pharmacology 2001, 419, 191-198).
These properties have been shown to be dependent on PPAR-α, and PEA activates this nuclear receptor with a potency comparable to the synthetic agonist WY14,643 (Lo Verme et al., Molecular Pharmacology 2005, 67, 15-19; Lo Verme et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2006, 319, 1051-1061).
In the carrageenan-induced paw edema and phorbol ester-induced ear edema models, PEA applied as a drug attenuates inflammation in wild-type mice, but has no effect in mice lacking PPAR-α(see LoVerme et al., Molecular Pharmacology 2005, 67, 15-19). PEA was also found to suppress pain behaviors induced, in mice, by chemical tissue injury, nerve damage, or inflammation (see LoVerme et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2006, 319, 1051-1061).
In addition to the pharmacological activities shown in animal models, PEA has been reported to attenuate skin inflammation in humans (Kemeny et al., Skin Pharmacology and Physiology 2007, 20, 155-161).
Activation of PPAR-α by selective receptor agonists could be envisaged as a viable approach for the treatment of inflammatory and pain states. However, the prolonged clinical use of PPAR-α agonists has been linked to serious adverse events, which include oncogenesis, renal dysfunction, and cardiovascular toxicity (Nissen et al., JAMA 2007, 297, 1362-1373). Sustaining PEA signaling at PPAR-α by protecting this lipid amide from degradation is envisaged as an alternative to direct PPAR-α activation by receptor agonists.
NAEs are substrate of the N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA), an enzyme that catalytically hydrolyzes the NAE to ethanolamine and the corresponding fatty acid. NAAA is a cysteine hydrolase that belongs to the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) family of enzymes (Tsuboi et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry 2005, 280, 11082-11092; Tsuboi et al., Chemistry and Biodiversity 2007, 4, 1914-1925). NAAA exhibits a substantial preference for PEA over other NAEs. Therefore, inhibition of NAAA is expected to decrease the inactivation and restore the levels of PEA in pathological conditions characterized by markedly reduced concentrations of this signaling molecule.
There exists a problem in the field to which the instant invention pertains related to the preparation of new inhibitors of NAAA for use in the preparation of pharmaceutical composition therapeutics. Surprisingly, the instant invention solves this as well as several other problems in the relevant field by providing, inter alia, small molecule chemical inhibitors of NAAA as well as methods for treating pain and inflammation.

Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the meaning commonly understood by a person skilled in the art to which this invention belongs. The following references provide one of skill with a general definition of many of the terms used in this invention: Singleton et al., DICTIONARY OF MICROBIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (2d ed. 1994); THE CAMBRIDGE DICTIONARY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Walker ed., 1988); THE GLOSSARY OF GENETICS, 5TH ED., R. Rieger et al. (eds.), Springer Verlag (1991); and Hale & Marham, THE HARPER COLLINS DICTIONARY OF BIOLOGY (1991). As used herein, the following terms have the meanings ascribed to them unless specified otherwise.
It is noted here that as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
The term “composition”, as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term “pharmaceutical composition” indicates a composition suitable for pharmaceutical use in a subject, including an animal or human. A pharmaceutical composition generally comprises an effective amount of an active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” encompasses any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers, buffers and excipients, including phosphate-buffered saline solution, water, and emulsions (such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsion), and various types of wetting agents and/or adjuvants. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are described in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, 19th ed. 1995). Preferred pharmaceutical carriers depend upon the intended mode of administration of the active agent. Typical modes of administration are described below.
The term “effective amount” means a dosage sufficient to produce a desired result on health, including, but not limited to, disease states. The desired result may comprise a subjective or objective improvement in the recipient of the dosage. A subjective improvement may be, for instance with respect to pain, decreased sensation of pain (e.g., noninflammatory pain, neuropathic pain). An objective improvement may be, for instance, an increased ability to move or use (e.g., place weight upon) an affected limb or a longer period of uninterrupted sleep, or a behavioral response indicating an increased tolerance of a painful stimuli.
A “prophylactic treatment” is a treatment administered to a subject who does not have the subject condition (e.g., pain), wherein the treatment is administered for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing the condition or to counter the severity of the condition (e.g., inflammation; pain, including but not limited to, acute pain, chronic pain, inflammatory pain, non-inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain and pain expected to result from the expected or likely occurrence of a painful event (e.g., surgery)) if one were to develop.
A “therapeutic treatment” is a treatment administered to a subject who has the condition (e.g., pain, and/or exhibits signs or symptoms of pain including but not limited to, acute pain, chronic pain, cancer pain, inflammatory pain, non-inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, wherein treatment is administered for the purpose of diminishing or eliminating those signs or symptoms) to be treated.
A “therapeutically effective amount” is an amount of an agent sufficient to reduce the signs and/or symptoms of the disease or condition or to prevent, oppose, or reduce their progression. The compound are generally administered to a patient for treatment in a therapeutically effective amount.
The term “treating” means combating, reducing, shortening, alleviating or eliminating a condition or symptoms thereof of the subject (e.g., pain, inflammation).
Pain, particularly severe pain, can be a stressor. Thus, in one aspect the invention is drawn to methods of treating chronic pain conditions, including neuropathic pain, and chronic or intermittent pain associated with chronic health conditions as such conditions are often substantial stressors. “Neuropathic pain” is pain caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system. Such pain is chronic and involves a maintained abnormal state of increased pain sensation, in which a reduction of pain threshold and the like are continued, due to persistent functional abnormalities ensuing from an injury or degeneration of a nerve, plexus or perineural soft tissue. Such injury or degeneration may be caused by wound, compression, infection, cancer, ischemia, or a metabolic or nutritional disorder such as diabetes mellitus. Neuropathic pain includes, but is not limited to, neuropathic allodynia wherein a pain sensation is induced by mechanical, thermal or another stimulus that does not normally provoke pain, neuropathic hyperalgesia wherein an excessive pain occurs in response to a stimulus that is normally less painful than experienced. Examples of neuropathic pain include diabetic polyneuropathy, entrapment neuropathy, phantom pain, thalamic pain after stroke, post-herpetic neuralgia, atypical facial neuralgia pain after tooth extraction and the like, spinal cord injury, trigeminal neuralgia and cancer pain resistant to narcotic analgesics such as morphine. The neuropathic pain includes the pain caused by either central or peripheral nerve damage. And it includes the pain caused by either mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy (e.g., familial amyloid polyneuropathy). As compared to inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain is relatively resistant to therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioid substances (e.g, morphine).
Neuropathic pain may be bilateral in mirror image sites, or may be distributed approximately according to the innervation of the injured nerve, it may persist for months or years, and be experienced as a burning, stabbing, shooting, throbbing, piercing electric shock, or other unpleasant sensation.

With respect to transdermal or dermal delivery routes of administration, methods for transdermal administration of drugs are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gennaro AR ed. 20th edition, 2000: Williams & Wilkins PA, USA. Dermal or skin patches are a preferred means for transdermal delivery of the compounds of the invention. Patches preferably provide an absorption enhancer such as DMSO to increase the absorption of the compounds. Other methods for transdermal drug delivery are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,962,012, 6,261,595, and 6,261,595. Each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
Preferred patches include those that control the rate of drug delivery to the skin. Patches may provide a variety of dosing systems including a reservoir system or a monolithic system, respectively. The reservoir design may, for example, have four layers: the adhesive layer that directly contacts the skin, the control membrane, which controls the diffusion of drug molecules, the reservoir of drug molecules, and a water-resistant backing Such a design delivers uniform amounts of the drug over a specified time period, the rate of delivery has to be less than the saturation limit of different types of skin.
The monolithic design, for example, typically has only three layers: the adhesive layer, a polymer matrix containing the compound, and a water-proof backing. This design brings a saturating amount of drug to the skin. Thereby, delivery is controlled by the skin. As the drug amount decreases in the patch to below the saturating level, the delivery rate falls.
Compounds of the invention may be used in combination with other compounds of the invention or with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment, prevention, suppression of a neurological or psychological disorder. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of the invention. When a compound of the invention is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound is preferred. When used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compound of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly.
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, dermal delivery, local or rectal administration, the active principle, by itself or in association with another active principle, can be administered to animals and humans in unit forms of administration mixed with conventional pharmaceutical carriers. The appropriate unit forms of administration include oral forms such as tablets, gelatin capsules, powders, granules and solutions or suspensions to be taken orally, sublingual and buccal forms of administration, aerosols, implants, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal or intraocular forms of administration and rectal forms of administration.
In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, the active principle or active principles are generally formulated in dosage units. The dosage unit may contain from 0.1 to 1000 mg, advantageously from 1 to 500 mg and preferably from 2 to 200 mg per dosage unit for daily administration.

The treatment may be prophylactic or therapeutic.
In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, the active principle or active principles are generally formulated in dosage units. The dosage unit may contain from 0.1 to 1000 mg, advantageously from 1 to 500 mg and preferably from 2 to 200 mg per dosage unit.
NAAA inhibition can increase PEA and OEA levels to inhibit peripheral inflammation and mast cell degranulation (Mazzari et al., European Journal of Pharmacology 1996, 300, 227-36; Berdishev et al., Life Science 1998, 63, 125-129; D'Agostino et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2007, 322, 1137-1143), as well as to exert antinociceptive effects in rats and mice (Calignano et al., Nature 1998, 394, 277-281; Calignano et al., European Journal of Pharmacology 2001, 419, 191-198). These properties have been shown to be dependent on PPAR-α expression, and PEA and OEA activate this nuclear receptor with high potency (Lo Verme et al., Molecular Pharmacology 2005, 67, 15-19; Lo Verme et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2006, 319, 1051-1061). In the carrageenan-induced paw edema and phorbol ester-induced ear edema models, PEA applied as a drug attenuates inflammation in wild-type mice, but has no effect in mice lacking PPAR-α(see LoVerme et al., Molecular Pharmacology 2005, 67, 15-19). PEA was also found to suppress pain behaviors in mice induced by chemical tissue injury, nerve damage, or inflammation (see LoVerme et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2006, 319, 1051-1061). In addition to the pharmacological activities shown in animal models, PEA has been reported to attenuate skin inflammation in humans (Kemeny et al., Skin Pharmacology and Physiology 2007, 20, 155-161). Certain methods of treating pain and inflammation by inhibiting NAAA have been disclosed in the Patent Application WO2009/049238. Some compounds disclosed in WO2009/049238 have been shown to prevent the carrageenan- and LPS-induced reduction in PEA and OEA levels in leukocytes and RAW264.7 macrophages, respectively, and attenuate inflammation and tissue damage produced in mice by traumatic spinal cord injury (Solorzano et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA 2009, 106, 20966-20971; Solorzano et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2010, 53, 5770-5781). Each of these publications and patent applications are specifically incorporated herein by reference particularly with respect to the biological properties and activities of NAAA inhibitors and PEA/OEA as well as of their therapeutic uses and their biological assay methods which can be used to assess the anti-inflammatory and anti-pain as well as the other therapeutic actions of the NAAA inhibitors of the present invention.

Methods for Testing Compounds on NAAA
UPLC/MS r-NAAA Assay
Lysosomal NAAA protein preparation was obtained by homogenizing male Sprague-Dawley rat lungs (Charles River) in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.32M sucrose. Samples were centrifuged at 800×g for 15 min at 4° C. Supernatants were centrifuged at 12,000×g for 30 min at 4° C. Pellets were then resuspended in PBS pH 7.4 and subjected to a freeze/thaw cycle at −80° C. The suspension was finally centrifuged at 105,000 g for 1 h at 4° C. The supernatant was used in enzymatic assays.
NAAA preparations were pre-incubated with various concentrations of test compounds or vehicle control in 100 mM NaH2PO4/Citrate buffer, 1% Triton-X, 3 mM DTT (pH 4.5) for 30 min at 37° C. Samples were incubated with heptadecenoylethanolamide (50 μM, Avanti Polar Lipids) at 37° C. for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of cold methanol containing heptadecanoic acid (NuCheck Prep) as internal standard. Samples were analyzed by UPLC/MS (Acquity, Waters). Heptadecenoic and heptadecanoic acids were eluted on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (50 mm length, 2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 μm pore size, Waters) isocratically at 0.5 mL/min for 1.5 min with a solvent mixture of 95% methanol and 5% H2O, both containing 0.25% Acetic Acid and 5.0 mM ammonium acetate. The column temperature was 40° C. Electrospray ionization was in the negative mode, capillary voltage was 0.5 kV, cone voltage was 25 kV, desolvation temperature was 500° C. N2 was used as drying gas at a flow rate of 1000 L/hour and a temperature of 500° C. The [M−H]− ion was monitored in the selected-ion monitoring mode (m/z values: heptadecenoic acid 267.37, heptadecanoic acid 269.37). Calibration curves were generated using commercial heptadecenoic acid (NuCheck Prep) Inhibition of NAAA activity was calculated as reduction of heptadecenoic acid in the samples compared to vehicle controls. IC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression analysis of log [concentration]/inhibition curves using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA—USA) applying a standard slope curve fitting.
Fluorogenic h-NAAA Assay
Hek293 cells stably transfected with the human NAAA coding sequence cloned from a human spleen cDNA library were used as enzyme source. Recombinant HEK-hNAAA pellets were resuspended in homogenizing buffer, and sonicated. Samples were centrifuged at 800×g for 15 min at 4° C. and the supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 12,000×g for 30 min at 4° C. The pellets were resuspended in PBS pH 7.4 on ice and subjected to a freeze/thaw cycle at −80° C. (two freeze/thaw cycles at −80° C. for Examples 34-37). The suspension was finally centrifuged at 105,000×g for 1 h at 4° C. Protein concentration was measured and samples stored at −80° C. until use.
The assay was run in Optiplate 96-wells black plates, in a total reaction volume of 200 μL. NAAA protein preparation (4.0 μg for Examples except 34-37, which were 20.0 μg) was pre-incubated for 10 min with various concentrations of test compounds or vehicle control (5% DMSO) in 100 mM citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 3.0 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% BSA, 150 mM NaCl. N-(4-methyl-2-oxo-chromen-7-yl)-hexadecanamide was used as a substrate (5.0 μM) and the reaction carried over for 30 min at 37° C. The samples were then read in a Perkin Elmer Envision plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission 460 nm. IC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression analysis of log [concentration]/inhibition curves using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA—USA) applying a standard slope curve fitting.
The selectivity of selected compounds versus Acid Ceramidase (AC) was determined.
Rat AC (r-AC) Assay
Rat AC (r-AC) was cloned from a brain cDNA library using primers based on the sequence obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database: 5′rAC (5′-GACCATGCTGGGCCGTAGT-3′) (SEQ ID NO:1) and 3′rAC (5′-CCAGCCTATACAAGGGTCT-3′) (SEQ ID NO:2). The PCR (High Fidelity PCR Master, Roche) product was subcloned into a pEF6-V5/His vector (Invitrogen) to construct a mammalian expression vector encoding V5/His-tagged rat AC. HEK293 cells were transfected with pEF6-rAC-V5/His using Super-Fect reagent (Qiagen) and screened with G418 (0.3 mg/mL). Cells were suspended in 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.32M sucrose, sonicated and centrifuged at 800×g for 15 min at 4° C. The supernatants were centrifuged again at 12,000×g for 30 min at 4° C. The pellets were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to 2 freeze-thaw cycles at −80° C. The suspensions were centrifuged at 105,000×g for 1 hour at 4° C. The supernatants containing recombinant AC were kept at −80° C. until use. Protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Recombinant rat AC (50 μg) was preincubated with inhibitors (final DMSO concentration 1%) in assay buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT, 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.5) for 30 min at 37° C. Reactions were started by the addition of 100 μM N-lauroyl ceramide (Nu-Chek Prep, Elysian, Minn.) and carried on for 30 min at 37° C. Reactions were stopped by addition of a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1, vol/vol) containing 1 nmol of heptadecanoic acid (HDA; NuChek Prep). The organic phases were collected, dried under N2, and analyzed by LC-MS in the negative-ion mode using heptadecenoic acid (HDA) as internal standard (m/z=199 for lauric acid, m/z=269 for HDA). HDA was eluted on an XDB Eclipse C18 column isocratically at 2.2 mL/min for 1 min with a solvent mixture of 95% methanol and 5% water, both containing 0.25% acetic acid and 5 mM ammonium acetate. The column temperature was 50° C. Electrospray ionization (ESI) was in the negative mode, capillary voltage as 4 kV, and fragmentor voltage was 100 V. N2 was used as drying gas at a flow rate of 13 L/min and a temperature of 350° C. Nebulizer pressure was set at 60 psi. We monitored [M+H]− in the selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode using HDA as internal standard. Calibration curves were generated using commercial lauric acid (Nu-Chek Prep; m/z=199).

Methods for Screening Compounds for a Therapeutic Activity
A variety of animal models can be used to test the compounds of the present invention for their therapeutic effectiveness in treating inflammatory and pain states. With the aim to better illustrate the present invention, without limiting it, a method for testing the compounds of the present invention for therapeutic effectiveness is reported hereunder.
Pharmacological Testing
Carrageenan-Induced Inflammation
Paw edema was induced by injecting X-carrageenan (1% weight/vol in sterile H2O, 50 μL) into the left hind paw of lightly restrained mice (Sasso et al., Pharmacol. Res. 2012; 65: 553-632). All experiments were performed in a quiet room, and experimenters were blinded to the treatment protocol at the time of the test. Edema was measured with a plethysmometer (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). Heat hyperalgesia was assessed measuring the latency to withdraw the hind paw from a focused beam of radiant heat (thermal intensity: infrared 3.0) applied to the plantar surface in a plantar test apparatus (Ugo Basile). The cutoff time was set at 30 s. Fresh drug solutions were prepared daily and given by intraperitoneal injection (in 80% sterile saline solution/10% PEG-400/10% Tween 80, 200 μL per animal), at the same time of carrageenan injection. Intraplantar administration of carrageenan in mice resulted in the development of paw edema and heat hyperalgesia. Both responses were markedly attenuated, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, by oral administration (p.o.) of compound 5 (3-30 mg/kg) as shown in FIG. 1 .
Acute Inflammation Models
Carrageenan-Induced Lung Inflammation
Saline or saline containing 2% carrageenan (0.1 mL) was injected into the pleural cavity of mice, using a 1 mm needle at the level of the 6th intercostal space. 4 hours after the injection of carrageenan, mice were killed by inhalation of CO2. The chest was carefully opened and the pleural cavity was rinsed with 1 mL of saline solution containing heparin (5 U/mL). The exudate and washing solution were removed by aspiration and the total volume of the fluid was measured. Any exudate that was contaminated with blood was discarded. The amount of exudate was calculated by subtracting the volume of washing fluid injected from the total volume recovered.
LPS-Induced Inflammation
Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively), and were submitted to intranasal instillation of LPS (1 μg/μL) or vehicle (saline 0.9%); the volume used was 1 μL/g body weight. In order to avoid drawing, the weight of each animal was divided by three; therefore each mouse received the respective volume of LPS or vehicle. Ex: animal 1 (24 g) received 3 times an intranasal instillation of 8 μL of LPS solution or vehicle.
The bronchoalveolar lavage and lung samples were collected 6 h or 24 h after the induction of inflammation.
General Purification and Analytical Methods
UPLC/MS analyses were run on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC/MS instrument consisting of a SQD Single Quadropole Mass Spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization interface and a photodiode array detector. The analyses were performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (50×2.1 mmID, particle size 1.7 μm) with a VanGuard BEH C18 pre-column (5×2.1 mmID, particle size 1.7 μm). The mobile phases were 10 mM NH4OAc at pH 5 adjusted with AcOH (A) and 10 mM NH4OAc in MeCN—H2O (95:5) at pH 5 (B). Electrospray ionization in positive and negative mode was used in the mass scan range 100-500 Da.
Purifications by preparative HPLC/MS were run on a Waters Autopurification system consisting of a 3100 Single Quadropole Mass Spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization interface and a 2998 Photodiode Array Detector. The HPLC system included a 2747 Sample Manager, 2545 Binary Gradient Module, System Fluidic Organizer and 515 HPLC Pump. The purifications were performed on a XBridge™ Prep C18 OBD column (100×19 mmID, particle size 5 μm) with a XBridge™ Prep C18 (10×19 mmID, particle size 5 μm) Guard Cartridge. The mobile phases were either 1) H2O and MeCN (B) or 2) 10 mM NH4OAc at pH 5 adjusted with AcOH (A) and 10 mM NH4OAc in MeCN—H2O (95:5) at pH 5 (B). Electrospray ionization in positive and negative mode was used in the mass scan range 100-500 Da.
Automated column chromatography purification was done using a Teledyne ISCO apparatus (CombiFlash® Rf) with normal phase pre-packed silica gel columns of different sizes (from 4 g until 120 g). Typical silica gel column chromatography is intended as a purification performed using normal glass columns filled with Merck silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) as stationary phase. Mixtures of solvents used as eluents are reported below.
Hydrogenation reactions were performed using H-Cube® continuous flow hydrogenation equipment (SS-reaction line version), employing disposable cartridges (CatCart®), preloaded with the required heterogeneous catalyst.
Microwave heating was performed using Explorer®-48 positions instrument (CEM).
NMR experiments were run on a Bruker Avance III 400 system (400.13 MHz for 1H, and 100.62 MHz for 13C), equipped with a BBI inverse probe and Z-gradients. Unless indicated, spectra were acquired at 300 K, using deuterated dimethylsulfoxyde (DMSO-d6) and deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) as solvents.  TABLE 2
