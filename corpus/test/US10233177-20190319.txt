FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention concerns TRPV1 antagonists characterized by a bicyclic portion and, when possible, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof along with the formulations containing them. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are useful in the treatment of pain and other conditions ameliorated by the inhibition of the vanilloid receptor TRPV1.
BACKGROUND
The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a member of ion channels mainly localized on primary afferent neurons. Activation of TRPV1 on sensory neurons by chemical stimulants including capsaicin and resiniferatoxin, as well as low pH (<6), heat (>42° C.), and nucleosides such as ATP, leads to an influx of Ca2+ and Na+ ions through the channel, causing depolarization of the cell and transmission of painful stimuli. Unlike traditional analgesic drugs that either suppress inflammation (e.g. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors) or block pain transmission (e.g. opiates), TRPV1 channel inhibitors aim to prevent pain by blocking a receptor where pain is generated. In patients, the expression of TRPV1 is up-regulated in a number of painful inflammatory disorders. TRPV1 as a pain target has been validated by genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition experiments. The pungency of capsaicin and many other agonists at the vanilloid receptor clearly defines TRPV1 as a key transducer in the pain pathway. Characterization of TRPV1 mice, which lack both copies of the TRPV1 gene, shows a complete absence of thermal hyperalgesia associated with inflammation demonstrating the key role of TRPV1 in disease and providing impetus to develop selective TRPV1 antagonists as a novel pain therapy with the potential for an improved side effect profile compared to existing therapies. Many novel selective and chemically distinct TRPV1 antagonists have been identified and a number of these have been assessed in preclinical models of pain. Some of them reverse mechanical hyperalgesia in the Freund's complete adjuvant model of inflammatory pain in rodents. Others show efficacy in neuropathic pain models, in post-operative pain and in cancer pain. These data provide robust validation of this approach for the treatment of a broad range of pain conditions in humans.
In the bladder, the presence of TRPV1 was demonstrated in various cell types, including urothelium, detrusor muscle and fibroblasts. There is good evidence that TRPV1 in urothelium is functional. Capsaicin evokes an inward current similar to that seen in DRG neurons in patch-clamped human urothelial cells. Furthermore capsaicin induces calcium uptake in human urothelial cells culture which is blocked by the TRPV1 antagonists implying that the regulation of TRPV1 is similar in sensory neurons and urothelial cells. Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome characterised by urgency (with or without urge incontinence), usually with frequency and nocturia, in the absence of other pathologic or metabolic conditions that might explain the symptoms. Differently from antimuscarinic compounds dominating the market of OAB that only act on the efferent components, TRPV1 antagonists, acting on sensory nerves or on urothelium, are effective in diverse experimental models of cystitis/overactive bladder without interfere with the physiological volume-induced avoiding contractions (VIVC) and distention of the urinary bladder in healthy animals.
The documented ability of citric acid as well as pungent compounds such as capsaicin to induce cough when delivered to the lungs of experimental animals and humans, combined with the contribution of TRPV1-sensitive nerves to airway hyper responsiveness and bronco constriction has led to a large degree of interest in the potential for targeting TRPV1 for the treatment of a range of respiratory diseases. These effects are thought to derive from the key contribution of TRPV1 which is highly expressed by sensory neurons and vagal afferents that innervate the airways, to the cough reflex. Preclinical studies have now demonstrated antitussive efficacy of a range of TRPV1 antagonists in rodent models.
Dry Eye is a chronic dysfunction on tear and ocular surface epithelium.
Changes in corneal osmolarity is a trigger key event in cytokine production and ocular inflammation which are main causes of Dry Eye.
There are evidences that TRPV1 signal induces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in the corneal epithelial cells and hyper osmolarity-induced cytokine production is prevented by TRPV1 antagonists in corneal epithelial cells.
These data provide a strong rational for the systemic and topical use of TRPV1 antagonists in the treatment of Dry Eye.

The salts may be formed by conventional means, such as by reacting the free base form of the suitable compounds of formula I with one or more equivalents of the appropriate acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble or in a solvent such as water which is removed under vacuum.
Compositions of the Invention
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise compounds of the present invention. The pharmaceutical compositions comprise compounds of the present invention that may be formulated together with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other mammals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), buccally or as an oral or nasal spray.
Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as, but not limited to, lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as, but not limited to, corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as, but not limited to, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as, but not limited to, cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as, but not limited to, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as, but not limited to, ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as, but not limited to, magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as, but not limited to, sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters (such as ethyl oleate) and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.
These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents that delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly (orthoesters) and poly (anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid; b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such carriers as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragées, capsules, pills and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and may also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient (s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.
The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned carriers.
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof.
Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.
Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth and mixtures thereof.
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating carriers or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.
Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals, which are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients and the like. The preferred lipids are natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins) used separately or together.
Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p. 33 et seq.
Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers or propellants that may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.
In the treatment of painful conditions such as those listed below, a suitable indicated dosage level is about 0.1 mg to 2000 mg/day, preferably from about 5 mg to 1000 mg per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 3 times a day.
It will be appreciated that the amount of a compound of formula I required for use in any treatment will vary not only with the particular compounds or compositions selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated, and the age and condition of the patient.
The agents of invention are useful vanilloid receptor antagonists for the treatment of pain of various genesis or aetiology and as anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of inflammatory reactions, diseases or conditions. They are useful for the treatment of inflammatory pain, for the treatment of hyperalgesia, and in particular for the treatment of severe chronic pain. They are, for example, useful for the treatment of pain, inflammation consequential to trauma, e.g. associated with burns or subsequent to surgical intervention, e.g. as post-operative analgesics, as well as for the treatment of inflammatory pain of diverse genesis, e.g. for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. They are suitable as analgesics for the treatment of pain associated with, e.g. angina or cancer.
Other forms of pain associated with the activity of TRPV1 are headache, dental pain, pelvic pain, migraine, mastalgia and visceral pain.
The disorders in which TRPV1 is involved are not limited to pain. Such diseases include: nerve-related diseases, e.g. neuropathies, nerve injury and stroke; irritable bowel syndrome; gastrointestinal disorders, e.g. gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, Crohn's disease; respiratory diseases, e.g. asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cough; urinary incontinence; urinary bladder hypersensitiveness; skin diseases, e.g. psoriasis, dermatitis; cardiac diseases e.g. myocardial ischemia; hair growth related disorders e.g. hirsutism, alopecia; rhinitis; pancreatitis; vulvodynia; psychiatric disorders, e.g. anxiety or fear; obesity.
The compounds of the present invention have potent analgesic effect and potential anti-inflammatory activity and their pharmaceutically formulations are thought to alleviate or to treat in particular neuropathic pain conditions such as diabetic neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia, urinary incontinence and cough.
The compounds of the invention are also useful as active ingredients of pharmaceutical compositions for the systemic and topical treatment of Dry Eye.
The invention will be now illustrated by means of the following examples.

Pharmacology
Drugs and reagents were obtained from the indicated companies: capsaicin, ionomycin, laminin, poly-L-lysine, collagenase, trypsin, L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, DMEM, HBSS, mouse-NGF-7S, ARA-C, HEPES, Tween80, Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) and BSA (Sigma, Italy); FBS and HS (Gibco, Italy); Fura-2-AM-ester (Vinci-Biochem, Italy) and Methylcellulose (Fluka, Switzerland). The stock concentration (10 mM) of capsaicin, Fura-2-AM-ester, ionomycin and all tested compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO.
Ca2+ Fluorescence Measurements in Cultured Rat Dorsal Root
Male SD rats (˜50 g, Charles River, Italy) were terminally anaesthetized and decapitated. Dorsal root ganglia were removed and placed in cold Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) before being transferred to collagenase (2 mg/ml) and trypsin (1 mg/ml) for 35 min at 37° C. The ganglia, placed in cold DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, were dissociated in single cells by several passages through a series of syringe needles (23G down to 25G). The medium and the ganglia were filtered to remove debris, topped up with 4 ml of DMEM medium and centrifuged (1100 rpm for 6 min). The final cell pellet was re-suspended in DMEM medium [supplemented with 100 ng/ml mouse Nerve Growth Factor (mouse-NGF-7S) and cytosine-β-D-arabinofuranoside free base (ARA-C) 2.5 μM]. The cells were plated on poly-L-lysine (8.3 μM)- and laminin (5 μM)-coated 25 mm glass cover slips and kept for 2 days at 37° C. in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO2 and air, then treated with Fura-2-AM-ester (5 μM) in a Ca2+ buffer solution having the following composition (mM): CaCl2 1.4, KCl 5.4, MgSO4 0.4, NaCl 135, D-glucose 5, HEPES 10 with BSA (0.1%), at pH 7.4, for 40 min at 37° C. The cells were then washed twice with the Ca2+ buffer solution and transferred to a chamber on the stage of a Nikon eclipse TE300 microscope. Fura-2-AM-ester was excited at 340 nM and 380 nM to indicate relative [Ca2+]i changes by the F340/F380 ratio recorded with a dynamic image analysis system (Laboratory Automation 2.0, RCS, Florence, Italy) and the cells were allowed (at least 10 min) to attain a stable fluorescence before beginning the experiment. A calibration curve was set up using buffer containing Fura-2-AM-ester and determinant concentrations of free Ca2+. This curve was then used to convert the data obtained from the F340/F380 ratio to [Ca2+]i (nM).
All exemplified compounds were tested at the concentration of 300 nM against the calcium uptake induced by 30 nM capsaicin. For selected molecules, the IC50 value was calculated.
CFA-Induced Thermal Hyperalgesia in Rats
This method was used for the determination of acute nociceptive thermal threshold and combines a chemical stimulus and heat for measuring pain sensitivity. Male SD rats (Charles River, Italy) weighing 100 to 250 gr. were used. Anti-hyperalgesic effects were investigated by using the Hargreaves' test. Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA; Sigma, USA) was used to induce thermal hyperalgesia. CFA contains killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is designed to provide continuous release of antigens necessary for stimulating a strong, persistent immune response. This effect causes the reduction of the hind paw withdrawal response latency induced by heat during the Hargreaves' test. Thermal stimulation was performed 30, 60, 120 and 180 (240 min only if needed) minutes after the oral administration of the antagonists. During the CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia experiments two different solubilization protocols were used: when items presented an amino group, a pH=2 aqueous solution of HCl and 2.5% Tween80 was used; otherwise molecules were suspended in 0.5% Methocel and 2.5% Tween80. Compounds were orally administrated (30 μmol/kg/10 ml) to rats 24 hours after the CFA treatment. CFA was injected into the plantar surface of a rat's hind paw at a fixed dose of 50 μl by the use of a micro syringe.
CFA-Induced Tactile Allodynia in Rats
Male SD rats (Charles River, Italy) weighing 100 to 250 g were put into a clean plastic cage on an elevated glass plate for 30 min before the test. This lets the animals accommodate to their new environment before testing. Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA, 50 μl) was injected into the plantar surface of the right hind paw. Tactile stimulation was performed with von Frey filaments (from 0.07 to 26 g). All antagonists were orally administered 22 hours after to the CFA administration. Von Frey filaments were applied 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min after compound administrations. Median 50% (EG50) threshold of von Frey filaments was calculated by using the up-down method as previously described. All tested compounds were suspended in 0.5% Methocel and 2.5% Tween80 and orally administrated (30 μmol/kg/10 ml) to rats by gavage 24 hours after the CFA treatment. CFA was injected into the plantar surface of a rat's hind paw at a fixed dose of 50 μl by the use of a micro syringe.
Rectal Temperature Measurements in Rats
Body temperature was measured by a digital thermometer inserted at a depth of approximately 3 cm into the rectum of each animal (male SD rats, Charles River, Italy, 100 to 250 g). A pre-dose value of body temperature was measured prior to the administration of the test substance or vehicles. Animals were distributed among groups by the manual method to achieve the almost same mean values of body temperature of the groups based on the pre-dose value. All compounds were dissolved in 6% DMSO/6% Tween80 and then intraperitoneally (10 μmol/Kg/5 ml) administrated to rats.
CCI-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia
Male SD rats (Charles River, Italy) weighing 250 g were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.), 0.1 ml/10 g) and, under a dissecting microscope, the right common sciatic nerve was exposed at the level of the mid thigh and, proximal to the trifurcation of the nerve; four ligatures (4/0 chromic silk, Ethicon) were loosely tied around it, at about 0.5 mm spacing, until they elicited a brief twitch in the respective hind, taking care to preserve epineural circulation. Sham-operated animals (sciatic exposure without ligation) were used as controls. 14 days after the surgery, mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed using an analgesimeter (Ugo Basile, Italy, Randall-Selitto analgesic apparatus). This device generated a mechanical force on the affected paw and the nociceptive threshold was defined as the force (in g) at which the rat withdraws the paw (with a cut-off of 450 g). Two baseline measurement values were obtained 75 and 45 min before the actual test. After the second baseline measurement, animals were randomly allocated to the different treatment groups. Paw pressure test was performed 0, 75, 120, 165, 210 and 300 min after the oral administration of the compounds. All tested compounds were orally administrated (30 μmol/kg/10 ml) to rats by gavage.
Results
Ca2+ Fluorescence Measurements in Cultured Rat Dorsal Root Ganglia Neurons
Capsaicin (0.3 μM) caused an increase in [Ca2+] in the vast majority (95%) of dorsal root ganglia neurons, which were thereby identified as TRPV1 expressing neurons. All synthesized derivatives were tested and all were able to inhibit the calcium uptake and several compounds exhibited more than 80% inhibition, e.g. compounds of Examples 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 23, 31, 32, 35, 36, 39, 41, 45, 46, 47, 48, 51, 53, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 74, 75, 78, 80, 81, 82, 86, 87 and 89.
