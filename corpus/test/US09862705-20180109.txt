FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to salt forms of the Pim kinase inhibitor N-{(7R)-4-[(3R,4R,5S)-3-amino-4-hydroxy-5-methylpiperidin-1-yl]-7-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridin-3-yl}-6-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-5-fluoropyridine-2-carboxamide, including methods of preparation thereof, and intermediates in the preparation thereof, where the compound is useful in the treatment of Pim kinase-related diseases such as cancer.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Overexpression of Pim kinases is detected in a wide variety of hematologic and solid cancers. Overexpression of various family members have been noted in multiple myeloma, AML, pancreatic and hepatocellular cancers. Claudio et al., Blood 2002, 100, 2175-86; Amson et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 1989, 86, 8857-61; Mizuki et al., Blood, 2003, 101, 3164-73; Li et al., Canc. Res., 2006, 66, 6741-7; Fujii et al., Int. J. Canc., 2005, 114, 209-18. Pim1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in mantle cell lymphoma, esophageal and head and neck cancers. Hsi et al., Leuk. Lymph., 2008, 49, 2081-90; Liu et al., J. Surg. Oncol., 2010, 102, 683-88; Peltola et al., Neoplasia, 2009, 11, 629-36. Pim2 overexpression is associated with an aggressive clinical course in a subset of DLBCL patients. Gomez-Abad et al., Blood, 2011, 118, 5517-27. Overexpression is often seen where Myc is overexpressed and Pim kinases can convey resistance to traditional chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. Chen et al., Blood, 2009, 114, 4150-57; Isaac et al., Drug Resis. Updates, 2011, 14, 203-11; Hsu et al., Cancer Lett., 2012, 319, 214; Peltola et al., Neoplasia, 2009, 11, 629-36. As such, these data indicate that inhibition of Pim kinases will be useful to provide therapeutic benefit in cancer patients.
Pim kinase inhibitors have been described in, for example, US Pat. Pub. Nos. 2014/0200216, 2014/0200227, and 2015/0057265. In particular, the Pim-inhibiting compound N-{4-[(3R,4R,5S)-3-amino-4-hydroxy-5-methylpiperidin-1-yl]-7-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridin-3-yl}-6-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-5-fluoropyridine-2-carboxamide (including both 7R and 7S diastereomers) is described in US Pat. Pub. No. 2014/0200227. Accordingly, new forms of Pim-inhibiting molecules are needed to help prepare pharmaceutically useful formulations and dosage forms with suitable properties related to, for example, facilitating the manufacture of safe, effective, high quality drug products. The present invention described herein is directed toward this end.

The salts of the invention can be isolated as one or more solid forms. As used herein, the phrase “solid form” refers to a salt of the invention in either an amorphous state or a crystalline state (“crystalline form” or “crystalline solid”), whereby a salt of the invention in a crystalline state may optionally include solvent or water within the crystalline lattice, for example, to form a solvated or hydrated crystalline form. The term “hydrated,” as used herein, is meant to refer to a crystalline form that includes water molecules in the crystalline lattice. Example “hydrated” crystalline forms include hemihydrates, monohydrates, dihydrates, and the like. Other hydrated forms such as channel hydrates and the like are also included within the meaning of the term.
The different crystalline forms of the salts of the invention are characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and/or thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). An X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of reflections (peaks) is typically considered a fingerprint of a particular crystalline form. It is well known that the relative intensities of the XRPD peaks can widely vary depending on, inter alia, the sample preparation technique, crystal size distribution, various filters used, the sample mounting procedure, and the particular instrument employed. In some instances, new peaks may be observed or existing peaks may disappear depending on the type of instrument or the settings (for example, whether a Ni filter is used or not). As used herein, the term “peak” or “characteristic peak” refers to a reflection having a relative height/intensity of at least about 3% of the maximum peak height/intensity. Moreover, instrument variation and other factors can affect the 2-theta values. Thus, peak assignments, such as those reported herein, can vary by plus or minus about 0.2° (2-theta), and the term “substantially” or “about” as used in the context of XRPD herein is meant to refer to the above-mentioned variations.
In the same way, temperature readings in connection with DSC, TGA, or other thermal experiments can vary about ±3° C. depending on the instrument, particular settings, sample preparation, etc. Accordingly, a crystalline form reported herein having a DSC thermogram “substantially” as shown in any of the Figures is understood to accommodate such variation.
The salts and compounds disclosed herein can include all isotopes of atoms occurring within them. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Salts and compounds of the invention can also include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. One or more constituent atoms of the compounds of the invention can be replaced or substituted with isotopes of the atoms in natural or non-natural abundance. In some embodiments, the compound includes at least one deuterium atom. For example, one or more hydrogen atoms in a compound of the present disclosure can be replaced or substituted by deuterium. In some embodiments, the compound includes two or more deuterium atoms. In some embodiments, the compound includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 deuterium atoms. Synthetic methods for including isotopes into organic compounds are known in the art.
In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention, or salts thereof, are substantially isolated. By “substantially isolated” is meant that the compound or salt is at least partially or substantially separated from the environment in which it was formed or detected. Partial separation can include, e.g., a composition enriched in the compounds of the invention. Substantial separation can include compositions containing at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 97%, or at least about 99% by weight of the compounds or salts of the invention.
The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
As used herein, the term “melting point” refers to an endothermic event or endothermal event observed in e.g., a DSC experiment. An endothermic event is a process or reaction in which a sample absorbs energy from its surrounding in the form of e.g., heat as in a DSC experiment. An exothermic event is a process or reaction in which a sample releases energy. The process of heat absorption and release can be detected by DSC. In some embodiments, the term “melting point” is used to describe the major endothermic event revealed on a particular DSC thermogram.
The term “room temperature” as used herein, is understood in the art, and refers generally to a temperature, e.g., a reaction temperature, that is about the temperature of the room in which the reaction is carried out, for example, a temperature from about 20° C. to about 30° C. The term “elevated temperature” as used herein, is understood in the art, and refer generally to a temperature, e.g., a reaction temperature, that is above room temperature, e.g., above 30° C.

As used herein, the term “reacting” is used as known in the art and generally refers to the bringing together of chemical reagents in such a manner so as to allow their interaction at the molecular level to achieve a chemical or physical transformation. In some embodiments, the reacting involves at least two reagents. In some embodiments, the reacting step of a synthetic process may involve one or more substances in addition to the reagents such as solvent and/or a catalyst. The reacting steps of the processes described herein can be conducted for a time and under conditions suitable for preparing the identified product. The terms “combining” and “mixing” with respect to reagents of a chemical reaction are used interchangeably with the term “reacting” herein. The term “coupling” also can be considered interchangeable with “reacting” but may be used in conjunction with a reaction step that involves the linking of two organic fragments.
The processes described herein can be monitored according to any suitable method known in the art. For example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (e.g., 1H or 13C), infrared spectroscopy, spectrophotometry (e.g., UV-visible), or mass spectrometry; or by chromatography such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography. The compounds obtained by the reactions can be purified by any suitable method known in the art. For example, chromatography (medium pressure) on a suitable adsorbent (e.g., silica gel, alumina and the like), HPLC, or preparative thin layer chromatography; distillation; sublimation, trituration, or recrystallization. The purity of the compounds, in general, are determined by physical methods such as measuring the melting point (in case of a solid), obtaining a NMR spectrum, or performing a HPLC separation. If the melting point decreases, if unwanted signals in the NMR spectrum are decreased, or if extraneous peaks in an HPLC trace are removed, the compound can be said to have been purified. In some embodiments, the compounds are substantially purified.
Preparation of compounds can involve the protection and deprotection of various chemical groups. The need for protection and deprotection, and the selection of appropriate protecting groups can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The chemistry of protecting groups can be found, for example, in Wuts and Greene, Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Ed., John Wiley & Sons: New York, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
The reactions of the processes described herein can be carried out at appropriate temperatures which can be readily determined by the skilled artisan. Reaction temperatures will depend on, for example, the melting and boiling points of the reagents and solvent, if present; the thermodynamics of the reaction (e.g., vigorously exothermic reactions may need to be carried out at reduced temperatures); and the kinetics of the reaction (e.g., a high activation energy barrier may need elevated temperatures). “Elevated temperature” refers to temperatures above room temperature (about 22° C.).
The reactions of the processes described herein can be carried out in suitable solvents which can be readily selected by one of skill in the art of organic synthesis. Suitable solvents can be substantially non-reactive with the starting materials (reactants), the intermediates, or products at the temperatures at which the reactions are carried out, i.e., temperatures which can range from the solvent's freezing temperature to the solvent's boiling temperature. A given reaction can be carried out in one solvent or a mixture of more than one solvent. Depending on the reaction step, suitable solvent(s) for that particular reaction step can be selected. Appropriate solvents include water, alkanes (such as pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, cyclohexane, etc., or a mixture thereof), aromatic solvents (such as benzene, toluene, xylene, etc.), alcohols (such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc.), ethers (such as dialkylethers, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, etc.), esters (such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, etc.), halogenated hydrocarbon solvents (such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform, dichloroethane, tetrachloroethane), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), acetone, acetonitrile (ACN), hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) and N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP). Such solvents can be used in either their wet or anhydrous forms.
Resolution of racemic mixtures of compounds can be carried out by any of numerous methods known in the art. An example method includes fractional recrystallization using a “chiral resolving acid” which is an optically active, salt-forming organic acid. Suitable resolving agents for fractional recrystallization methods are, for example, optically active acids, such as the D and L forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids. Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed with an optically active resolving agent (e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine). Suitable elution solvent composition can be determined by one skilled in the art.

Also provided is the use of Compound 1 phosphoric acid salt, or any of the embodiments thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a Pim kinase-associated disease or disorder.
A Pim kinase-associated disease can include any disease, disorder or condition that is directly or indirectly linked to expression or activity of the Pim kinase, including over-expression and/or abnormal activity levels. Abnormal activity levels can be determined by comparing activity level in normal, healthy tissue or cells with activity level in diseased cells. A Pim kinase-associated disease can also include any disease, disorder or condition that can be prevented, ameliorated, inhibited or cured by modulating Pim kinase activity. In some embodiments, the disease is characterized by the abnormal activity or expression (e.g., overexpression) of one or more Pim1, Pim2 and Pim3. In some embodiments, the disease is characterized by mutant Pim1, Pim2 or Pim3. A Pim kinase associated disease can also refer to any disease, disorder or condition wherein modulating the expression or activity of one or more Pim kinases is beneficial.
Pim kinase associated diseases that can be treated according to the invention include cancer, including, in particular, cancers in which Pim kinases are upregulated or an oncogene, e.g., Myc or BCL2, is activated.

The term “treating” or “treatment” refers to one or more of (1) inhibiting the disease; e.g., inhibiting a disease, condition or disorder in an individual who is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the disease, condition or disorder (i.e., arresting further development of the pathology and/or symptomatology); and (2) ameliorating the disease; e.g., ameliorating a disease, condition or disorder in an individual who is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the disease, condition or disorder (i.e., reversing the pathology and/or symptomatology) such as decreasing the severity of disease.
In some embodiments, the salts of the present invention may be useful in preventing or reducing the risk of developing the disease; e.g., preventing or reducing the risk of developing a disease, condition or disorder in an individual who may be predisposed to the disease, condition or disorder but does not yet experience or display the pathology or symptomatology of the disease.
Combination Therapies
Cancer cell growth and survival can be impacted by multiple signaling pathways. Thus, it is useful to combine different kinase inhibitors, exhibiting different preferences in the kinases which they modulate the activities of, to treat such conditions. Targeting more than one signaling pathway (or more than one biological molecule involved in a given signaling pathway) may reduce the likelihood of drug-resistance arising in a cell population, and/or reduce the toxicity of treatment.

Formulation, Dosage Forms and Administration
The salts of the invention can be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Thus the present disclosure provides a composition comprising the salts of the invention, or any of the embodiments thereof, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. These compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is indicated and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including transdermal, epidermal, ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal or intranasal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal intramuscular or injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, e.g., by a continuous perfusion pump. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable.
This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, a salt of the invention, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (excipients). In some embodiments, the composition is suitable for topical administration. In making the compositions of the invention, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, e.g., a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, e.g., up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders.
In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g., about 40 mesh.
The salts of the invention may be milled using known milling procedures such as wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by processes known in the art see, e.g., WO 2002/000196.
Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; and sweetening agents and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.
In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises silicified microcrystalline cellulose (SMCC) and at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In some embodiments, the silicified microcrystalline cellulose comprises about 98% microcrystalline cellulose and about 2% silicon dioxide w/w.
In some embodiments, the composition is a sustained release composition comprising at least a salt described herein, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the composition comprises a salt described herein, and at least one component selected from microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and polyethylene oxide. In some embodiments, the composition comprises at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. In some embodiments, the composition comprises at a salt described herein and microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate and polyethylene oxide. In some embodiments, the composition further comprises magnesium stearate or silicon dioxide. In some embodiments, the microcrystalline cellulose is Avicel PH102™. In some embodiments, the lactose monohydrate is Fast-flo 316™. In some embodiments, the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2208 K4M (e.g., Methocel K4 M Premier™) and/or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2208 K100LV (e.g., Methocel K00LV™). In some embodiments, the polyethylene oxide is polyethylene oxide WSR 1105 (e.g., Polyox WSR 1105™).
In some embodiments, a wet granulation process is used to produce the composition. In some embodiments, a dry granulation process is used to produce the composition.
The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 1,000 mg (1 g), more usually about 100 mg to about 500 mg, of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 10 mg of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 50 mg of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 25 mg of the active ingredient. The term “unit dosage forms” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Solid oral dosage forms include, for example, tablets, capsules, and pills.
The components used to formulate the pharmaceutical compositions are of high purity and are substantially free of potentially harmful contaminants (e.g., at least National Food grade, generally at least analytical grade, and more typically at least pharmaceutical grade). Particularly for human consumption, the composition is preferably manufactured or formulated under Good Manufacturing Practice standards as defined in the applicable regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For example, suitable formulations may be sterile and/or substantially isotonic and/or in full compliance with all Good Manufacturing Practice regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The active compound may be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a therapeutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms and the like.
The therapeutic dosage of a compound of the present invention can vary according to, e.g., the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 μg/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
For preparing solid compositions such as for tablets, capsules, pills, or other oral dosage forms, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, e.g., about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.
The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.
The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present invention can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face mask, tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.
Topical formulations can contain one or more conventional carriers. In some embodiments, ointments can contain water and one or more hydrophobic carriers selected from, e.g., liquid paraffin, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, propylene glycol, white Vaseline® (petroleum jelly) and the like. Carrier compositions of creams can be based on water in combination with glycerol and one or more other components, e.g., glycerinemonostearate, PEG-glycerinemonostearate and cetylstearyl alcohol. Gels can be formulated using isopropyl alcohol and water, suitably in combination with other components such as, e.g., glycerol, hydroxyethyl cellulose and the like. In some embodiments, topical formulations contain at least about 0.1, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.5, at least about 1, at least about 2, or at least about 5 wt % of the compound of the invention. The topical formulations can be suitably packaged in tubes of, e.g., 100 g which are optionally associated with instructions for the treatment of the select indication, e.g., psoriasis or other skin condition.
The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient and the like.
The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.

Asymmetric Synthesis of (7R)-7-{[tert-Butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy}-4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine-3-carbonitrile (20)
Step 1. 6,7-Dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine 1-oxide (11)
To a mixture of 6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine (10) (10.0 g, 83.9 mmol) in methanol (50 mL) was added urea hydrogen peroxide adduct (UHP, 24 g, 250 mmol, 3.0 equiv.) and methyltrioxorhenium(VII) (80 mg, 0.3 mmol, 0.0036 equiv.) at room temperature. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight before being concentrated under reduced pressure to remove methanol. After no more distillate was observed, methylene chloride (100 mL) was added and the concentration was continued. The resulting residue was treated with methylene chloride (100 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes. The solids were filtered and extracted with methylene chloride for 3 times (3×50 mL). The combined filtrates were dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) before being filtered through a silica gel pad (SiO2). The pad was rinsed with 10% MeOH in CH2CH2 (100 mL) for 3 times. The combined filtrates were concentrated to give the desired product, 6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine 1-oxide (11, 11.5 g, 99% yield) as off-white solid, which was used in the subsequent reaction without further purification. For 11: 1HNMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.05 (d, J=6.0 Hz, 1H), 7.08 (m, 2H), 3.15. (t, J=6.0 Hz, 2H), 3.00. (t, J=6.0 Hz, 2H), 2.16 (m, 2H) ppm; LCMS (EI) m/z 136 (C8H9NO, (M+H)+).

6,7-Dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine 1-oxide (11, 12.0 g, 84.3 mmol) was slowly added into phosphoryl chloride (POCl3, 24 mL, 250 mmol, 3.0 equiv) and toluene (48 mL) at 80-85° C. (internal temperature) with about 0.2 g per portion over 2 hours. After the completion of addition, the reaction mixture was continued to stir at 80-85° C. (internal temperature) for 3 hours. The excess amount of POCl3 and toluene was removed under reduced pressure at 60° C. The resulting residue was then poured to a cooled mixture of ice (50 g) and the saturated aqueous sodium carbonate solution (Na2CO3, 50 mL). The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 8 using 25% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH, about 30 mL). The mixture was then extracted with methylene chloride (3×100 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered through a pad of silica gel (SiO2, 36 g) and charcoal (6 g, on the top of silica gel). The pad was rinsed with ethyl acetate (4×100 mL) until no desired product came out from the silica gel pad. The combined filtrates were then concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude desired product (12, 10.93 g). To the mixture of crude 4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine (12, 10.7 g, 69.6 mmol) in THF (50 mL) was added 3-chlorobenzoic acid (11 g, 73 mmol) at room temperature. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature until 3-chlorobenzoic acid was dissolved. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to generate the crude salt as solids, which was treated with hexanes (32 mL). The resulting suspension was stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes. The solids were collected by filtration, washed with hexanes (2×32 mL). More solids were collected from the filtrates. The combined wet solids (about 18 g) were dissolved in methylene chloride (100 mL) and treated with the saturated aqueous Na2CO3 solution (2×20 mL). The aqueous layers were back extracted with methylene chloride (50 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to give the purified desired product, 4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine (12, 7.1 g), as dark oil. For 12: 1HNMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.20 (d, J=3.0 Hz, 1H), 7.02 (d, J=3.0 Hz, 1H), 3.06. (t, J=6.0 Hz, 2H), 2.98. (t, J=6.0 Hz, 2H), 2.12 (m, 2H) ppm; LCMS (EI) m/z 154/156 (C8H8ClN, (M+H)+).

The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove methanol. Methylene chloride (500 mL) was added and the concentration was continued. The resulting residue was treated with methylene chloride (500 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. The solids were filtered and extracted with methylene chloride for (4×500 mL). The combined filtrates were dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3). The mixture was then filtered through a pad of silica gel (SiO2, 180 g) and the activated charcoal (10 g). The pad was rinsed with 10% MeOH in CH2CH2 (500 mL) 3 times. The combined filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure to give the desired product, 4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine 1-oxide (13, 104 g), as off-white solids. For 13: 1HNMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 8.04 (d, J=6.0 Hz, 1H), 7.34 (d, J=6.0 Hz, 1H), 2.98. (m, 4H), 2.08 (m, 2H) ppm; LCMS (EI) m/z 170/172 (C8H8ClNO, (M+H)+).

4-Chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine 1-oxide (13) (65.0 g, 340 mmol) was added to the mixture of acetic anhydride (Ac2O, 98 mL, 1000 mmol) and toluene (325 mL) in portions (6 g per portion) at 80-85° C. over 1 hour. After the addition was complete, the resulting mixture was stirred at 80-85° C. for 3 hours. When the reaction completion was indicated by LCMS and/or HPLC, the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove acetic anhydride and toluene. The crude desired product, 4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridin-7-yl acetate (14), obtained was used directly in the subsequent reaction without further purification. For 14: 1HNMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 8.38 (d, J=6.0 Hz, 1H), 7.21 (d, J=6.0 Hz, 1H), 6.14.

The resulting mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure to remove methanol. The precipitated solids were collected by filtration, washed with water (3×100 mL), and dried to give the first portion of the crude product (15). The aqueous layers were extracted with DCM (3×300 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to give the second portion of the crude product (15). The crude desired product, 4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridin-7-ol (15, 61.9 g, 93% yield for 2 steps) obtained from two portions as dark brown oil, was directly used in the subsequent reaction without further purification. For 15: 1HNMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 8.34 (d, J=3.0 Hz, 1H), 7.18 (d, J=3.0 Hz, 1H), 5.26. (t, J=3.0 Hz, 1H), 3.08 (m, 1H), 2.86 (m, 1H), 2.60 (m, 1H), 2.09 (m, 1H) ppm; LCMS (EI) m/z 170/172 (C8H8ClNO, (M+H)+).
Step 6. 4-Chloro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridin-7(6H)-one (16)
To the solution of 4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridin-7-ol (15, 110.3 g, 650.32 mmol) in methylene chloride (800 mL) was added N,N-diisopropylethylamine (339.5 g, 2627.0 mmol) at room temperature. After the mixture was cooled to 0° C., pyridine-sulfur trioxide (1:1) (200.0 g, 1256.6 mmol) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 800 g) was added dropwise over 35 minutes and the resulting mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 1 hour. The reaction progress was monitored by HPLC and about 30% of starting material 15 was left. Additional amounts of pyridine-sulfur trioxide (1:1) (138 g, 866.8 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (79.8 g, 617 mmols) were added, and the reaction mixture was stirred under an ice bath for another 2 hours. Water (1000 mL) was added to the reaction mixture, and the resulting mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove methylene chloride. The resulting residue was carefully poured into saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2000 mL). The solids were collected by filtration, washed with water (2×200 mL), and dried to give the first portion of the crude desired product (16). The aqueous filtrate was extracted with methylene chloride (2×200 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to give the second portion of the crude desired product (16). The combined crude desired product was purified by silica gel flash chromatography (SiO2, eluted with 0 to 50% ethyl acetate/hexane) to provide the desired product, 4-chloro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridin-7(6H)-one (16, 87 g, 80% yield), as yellow to brown oil, which solidified upon standing in vacuum. For 16: 1HNMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 8.68 (d, J=6.0 Hz, 1H), 7.48 (d, J=6.0 Hz, 1H), 3.18 (m, 2H), 2.81 (m, 2H) ppm; LCMS (EI) m/z 168/170 (C8H6ClNO, (M+H)+).
Step 7. (R)-4-Chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridin-7-ol (17)
To the solution of 4-chloro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridin-7(6H)-one (16, 138.0 g, 823.4 mmol) and triethylamine (TEA, 573.8 mL, 4117 mmol) in methylene chloride (1100 mL) was added RuCl(p-cymene)[(R,R)-Ts-DPEN] (1.31 g, 2.06 mmol) at room temperature. The resulting mixture was degassed, cooled down to 5-10° C., and stirred at 5-10° C. under nitrogen. Formic acid (155.3 mL, 4117 mmol) was then added slowly (internal temperature) to the reaction mixture at 7-14° C. After the addition, the reaction mixture gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred at room temperature for 22 hours. When LC/MS and HPLC showed the reaction was complete, the reaction mixture was quenched with the saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution (1000 mL) and water (1500 mL). The two layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride (3×500 mL). The organic layers were combined, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to give the crude desired product, (R)-4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridin-7-ol (17, assumed 100% yield) as yellow to brown oil, which was directly used for the subsequent reaction without further purification. For 17: 1HNMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 8.33 (d, J=6.0 Hz, 1H), 7.19 (d, J=6.0 Hz, 1H), 5.27 (m, 1H), 3.08 (m, 1H), 2.86 (m, 1H), 2.57 (m, 1H), 2.10 (m, 1H) ppm; LCMS (EI) m/z 170/172 (C8H8ClNO, (M+H)+).
Step 8. (R)-7-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxy)-4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine (18)
To the stirred solution of (R)-4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridin-7-ol (17, 172.25 g, 1015.6 mmol) in anhydrous methylene chloride (2500 mL) was added tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (172.25 g, 1015.6 mmol) and 1H-imidazole (101.3 g, 1472 mmol) at 0-5° C. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for overnight. When LC/MS and HPLC showed the reaction was complete, the reaction mixture was quenched with water (1000 mL). The two layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride (3×500 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to give the crude desired product (18). The purification of the crude product on silica gel chromatography (SiO2, eluting with 0-10% ethyl acetate in hexanes) provided the desired product, (R)-7-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine (18, 253.0 g, 87.8% yield for 2 steps) as yellow to brown oil.

The resulting mixture was warmed up to >−32° C. and stirred at −32° C. to 0° C. for 30 minutes and then cooled to −78° C. (external bath). (R)-7-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine (18, 106.0 g, 373 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (380 mL) was added dropwise to the above cooled mixture at −74° C. to −76° C. (internal temperature). After the resulting dark brown solution was stirred at −74° C. (internal temperature) for 90 minutes, anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 130 g, 1129 mmol) was added and the internal temperature was maintained at −76° C. to −70° C. during addition. The resulting reaction mixture was continued to stir at −74° C. to −72° C. for 2 hours before being quenched with 1 N aqueous HCl solution (500 mL) and water (500 mL). The two phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with MTBE (2×250 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with brine (2×250 mL) and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude product (19). The purification of the crude product on silica gel chromatography (SiO2, eluting with 0-8% ethyl acetate in hexane) provided the desired product, (R)-7-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine-3-carbaldehyde (19, 110.7 g, 94% yield), as yellow to brown oil.

Study of Polymorphism of Compound 1 Phosphate Using Anti-Solvent Addition
Saturated solutions of Compound 1 phosphate were prepared by adding the Compound 1 phosphate (Form I) to DMF, MeOH, MeOH/20% water and DMSO respectively. An anti-solvent was added to induce precipitation. MTBE, IPAc, EtOAc, MeCN, MIBK, MEK and toluene were selected as the anti-solvents. Experiments that did not produce any particulate solids on anti-solvent addition were not studied further.
In antisolvent addition (see Table 8), Form I was identified from MeOH/IPAc, MeOH/EtOAc, MeOH/MEK, aq. MeOH/MTBE, DMSO/MeCN, DMSO/IPAc, and DMSO/MEK. Form II was identified from MeOH/MeCN, aq. MeOH/MeCN, and aq. MeOH/IPAc. Amorphous was found from MeOH/TBME and MeOH/MIBK.

Study of Polymorphism of Compound 1 Phosphate Using Heating and Cooling Cycles
This experiment was designed to search for stable crystalline forms. Saturated solutions were prepared at 50° C., and cooled in a bath slowly by using a programmed circulating bath to give clear solution for all solvents. To the clear solution was added about 10 mg of Compound 1 phosphate Form I to give slurry. The resulting slurry was then heated to 50° C. over 2 hours and then cooled down to 5° C. over 2 hours. This process was repeated for 3 days and the solid was filtered for further analysis. The results are presented in Table 11. Form I was identified for all of the samples.  TABLE 11

Study of Polymorphism of Compound 1 Phosphate Using Evaporation
Evaporation studies were carried out to identify the predominant crystal form during uncontrolled precipitation. Experiments that did not result in any particulate solids (i.e. clear thin films and oils) were not studied further (n/a). XRPD was used to characterize the solid-state morphology of the crystalline forms of the evaporation samples at 25±1° C. and 50±1° C. controlled by IKA® ETS-D5 temperature controller and IKA® RCT basic safety control.
The results are presented in Table 12 (25±1° C.) and Table 13 (50±1° C.). Evaporation at 25±1° C. (Table 12) resulted in polymorphic Form II (DMF). Evaporation at 50±1° C. (Table 13) resulted in two polymorphic forms including Form III (DMF) and Form IV (water).  TABLE 12

Competitive Stability Study of Compound 1 Phosphate Crystalline Solids in IPA/MeOH/Water/DMSO
To evaluate the transformation of Compound 1 phosphate solid forms, competitive slurry experiments were performed as follows: to a saturated solution (1.5 mL) of Compound 1 phosphate Form I in the solvent as listed in Table 14 was added Form I (6 mg), followed by stirring to give a cloudy solution, then 6 mg each of Form II through Form VI were added to the mixture. The slurry was stirred for 2 days at room temperature and analyzed by XRPD. The results in Table 14 revealed that the Compound 1 phosphate Form I appears to be the most stable form in either of the IPA/methanol/water/DMSO mixtures.  TABLE 14

Pim Enzyme Assays
Pim-1 and Pim-3 kinase assays-20 μL reactions can be run in white 384 well polystyrene plates dotted with 0.8 μL compound/DMSO in the assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.01% Tween-20, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% BSA, 5 mM DTT), containing 0.05 M Biotin-labeled BAD peptide substrate (AnaSpec 62269), 1 mM ATP, and 2.5 pM (Pim-1, Invitrogen PV3503) or 1.25 pM (Pim-3, Millipore 14-738) enzyme for 1 h at 25° C. Reactions are stopped by addition of 10 μL STOP Buffer (150 mM Tris, pH=7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 75 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20, 0.3% BSA) supplemented with Phospho-Bad (Ser112) Antibody (Cell Signaling 9291) diluted 666-fold, and Streptavidin donor beads (PerkinElmer 6760002) along with Protein-A acceptor beads (PerkinElmer 6760137) at 15 μg/mL each. Supplementation of the STOP buffer with beads and stopping the reactions are done under reduced light. Prior to the stopping reactions STOP buffer with beads is pre-incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. After stopping the reactions, plates are incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature before reading on a PHERAstar FS plate reader (BMG Labtech) under reduced light.
Pim-2 kinase assay-20 μL reactions are run in white 384 well polystyrene plates dotted with 0.8 μL compound/DMSO in the assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.01% Tween-20, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% BSA, 5 mM DTT), containing 0.05 M Fluorescein-labeled CREBtide peptide substrate (Invitrogen PV3508), 1 mM ATP, and 1 nM enzyme (Invitrogen PV3649) for 2 h at 25° C. Reactions are stopped by addition of 10 μL TR-FRET Dilution Buffer (Invitrogen PV3574) with 30 mM EDTA and 1.5 nM LanthaScreen Tb-CREB pSer133 antibody (Invitrogen PV3566). After 30 min. incubation at room temperature, plates are read on a PHERAstar FS plate reader (BMG Labtech).
Compounds or salts of the invention having an IC50 of 2 μM or less when tested for PIM kinase activity under the assay conditions disclosed above are considered active. Compound 1 was tested according to this assay and found to have an IC50<100 nM. Compound 1 phosphate salt and Compound 1 dihydrochloric acid salt were tested according to this assay and data is provided below in Table 16.
Although the above in vitro assays are conducted at 1 mM ATP, compounds can also be evaluated for potency and in vitro activity against PIM targets utilizing Km conditions, where the concentration of ATP is set to the Km value and the assay is more sensitive to PIM inhibition activity.

Pim Cellular and Whole Blood Assays
Pim Cell Proliferation Assays
KMS12BM and MOLM16 cells were purchased from DSMZ (Germany) and were maintained according to the recommendations of suppliers. To measure the anti-proliferation activities of test compounds, the cells were plated in their respective culture medium (2×103 cells/200 μL/well) into 96-well ultralow binding plates (Corning), with or without test compound(s). After 3 to 4 days, [3H]-thymidine (1 μCi/well) (PerkinElmer) in PBS (10 μL) was then added to the cell culture for an additional 12 hours before the incorporated radioactivity was separated by filtration with water through GF/B filters (Packard Bioscience) and measured by liquid scintillation counting with a TopCount (Packard Bioscience).
Pim pBAD Signaling Assays
To measure the effect of test compounds on the level of pBAD in cells, KMS12BM cells (DSMZ, Germany) were plated with RPMI and 10% FBS (4×105 cells/well/100 μL) into 96-well v-bottom polypropylene plates (Greiner) in the presence or absence of 5 μL of a concentration range test compound(s). After 2.5 hours at 37° C. and 5% CO2, the cells were lysed in 100 μL of cell extraction buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) containing PMSF, HALT, and protease inhibitors (Thermo, EMD Calbiochem). pBAD protein in the cell lysates was quantified with the Human pBAD S112 ELISA Kit (Cell Signaling Technology). IC50 determination was performed by fitting the curve of percent inhibition versus the log of the inhibitor concentration using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software
To measure the effect of test compounds on the level of pBAD in cells in the presence of human whole blood, human heparinized whole blood (Biological Specialty Corp, Colmar Pa.) was obtained and 350 μL/well was added to a 96-well 2 mL block plate (Costar 3961) in the presence or absence of 20 μL of a concentration range of test compound(s). KMS12BM cells (1×106) or MOLM-16 cell (5×105) (DSMZ, Germany) in 25 μL of RPMI and 10% FBS (GIBCO) were added to each well. After 2.5 hours at 37° C. and 5% CO2, red blood cells were lysed with erythrocyte lysis buffer (Qiagen) and the remaining cells were centrifuged at 1200 RPM. The resulting pellets were lysed with 100 μL of cell extraction buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) containing Halt, PMSF, and protease inhibitors (Thermo, Calbiochem, Sigma). The level of pBAD protein in the cell lysates were then quantified in a commercial Human pBAD S112 ELISA Kit (Cell Signaling Technology). IC50 determination was performed by fitting the curve of percent inhibition versus the log of the inhibitor concentration using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.
