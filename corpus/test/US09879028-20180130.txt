BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, Erb-B1) belongs to a family of proteins involved in the proliferation of normal and malignant cells. Overexpression of EGFR is found in over 70% of human cancers including without limitation non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), breast cancers, gliomas, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and prostate cancer. The EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) reversible inhibitor erlotinib (Tarceva®) is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of NSCLC and advanced pancreatic cancer. Other FDA approved anti-EGFR targeted molecules include gefitinib (Iressa®) and lapatinib.
The response rate of lung cancer tumor shrinkage to erlotinib or gefitinib is about 8-10% and the median time to tumor progression is approximately 2 months. However, lung cancers with somatic mutations in EGFR can be associated with dramatic clinical responses following treatment with geftinib and erlotinib. Somatic mutations identified to date include point mutations in which a single amino acid residue is altered in the expressed protein (e.g. L858R, G719S, G719C, G719A, L861Q), as well as small in frame deletions in exon 19 or insertions in exon 20. Prospective clinical trials treating chemotherapy naïve patients with EGFR mutations with gefitinib or erlotinib have found radiographic response rates ranging from 60-82% and median times to progression of 9.4 to 13.3 months. See Inoue, A. et al., Prospective phase II study of gefitinib for chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations. J Clin Oncol 24, 3340-3346 (2006); Sequist, L. V. et al., First-line gefitinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer harboring somatic EGFR mutations. J Clin Oncol 26, 2442-2449 (2008). These outcomes are 3- to 4-fold greater than that observed with platin-based chemotherapy (20-30% and 3-4 months, respectively) for advanced NSCLC. Conversely, NSCLC patients with wild type EGFR may have a worse outcome when they received gefitinib compared to chemotherapy as their initial treatment for advanced NSCLC. Thus EGFR mutations can be used to select NSCLC patients for therapy with EGFR TKIs over conventional chemotherapy.
Despite the initial clinical benefits of gefitinib/erlotinib in NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, most if not all patients ultimately develop progressive cancer while receiving therapy on these agents. A secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, can render gefitinib and erlotinib ineffective inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity. The EGFR T790M mutation is found in approximately 50% of tumors (24/48) from patients that acquire resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. This secondary genetic alteration occurs in the “gatekeeper” residue and in an analogous position to other secondary resistance alleles in diseases treated with kinase inhibitors, e.g., T315I in ABL in imatinib resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
Another major limitation of current EGFR inhibitors is the development of toxicity in normal tissues. Because ATP affinity of EGFR T790M is similar to wild type EGFR, the concentration of an irreversible EGFR inhibitor required to inhibit EGFR T790M may also effectively inhibit wild type EGFR. The class-specific toxicities of current EGFR kinase inhibitors, e.g., skin rash and diarrhea, are a result of inhibiting wild type EGFR in non-cancer tissues. These toxicities preclude dose escalation of current agents to plasma levels that can effectively inhibit EGFR T790M.
The present invention provides mutant specific EGFR inhibitors that are less effective against wild type EGFR.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides compounds that are able to modulate the activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), including EGFR kinase activity and human epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (Her-kinases). The invention further provides the use of these compounds in the treatment of various Conditions.
The EGFR kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib, are clinical therapies for non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) that harbor activating mutations in the EGFR kinase domain. EGFR activating mutations can be located in exons 18-21 of the EGFR kinase domain and can lead to constitutive activation of EGFR kinase activity and oncogenic transformation. At least two of these activating mutations (the L858R point mutation and an exon 19 deletion mutation) impart an increased affinity for gefitinib and a decreased affinity for ATP relative to wild type (WT) EGFR. Together, these two effects yield as much as a 100-fold more potent inhibition of mutant EGFR compared to WT EGFR by gefitinib. However, the clinical efficacy of EGFR kinase inhibitors is limited by the development of drug resistance in all patients. Secondary mutations in the gatekeeper T790 residue (T790M) have been detected in 50% of EGFR mutant NSCLC patients that have developed acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. EGFR T790M only modestly affects gefitinib binding but more importantly leads to a higher affinity for ATP similar to that of wild type EGFR. The T790M mutation does not preclude binding of irreversible inhibitors but can confer resistance to reversible inhibitors in part by increasing the affinity of the enzyme for ATP. Irreversible inhibitors can overcome this mechanism of resistance because they are no longer in competition with ATP after they are covalently bound.
The majority of EGFR inhibitors that are currently approved or under clinical evaluation were initially identified and developed as ATP-competitive inhibitors of wild-type EGFR. Currently approved EGFR inhibitors include three reversible EGFR kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib and lapatinib) which are all based on a 4-anilinoquinazoline core scaffold. Previously developed irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors that can inhibit EGFR are also based upon a 4-anilinoquinazoline or the closely related 4-anilinoquinoline-3-carbonitrile scaffolds but contain an electrophilic functionality which undergoes a Michael addition reaction with a conserved, solvent exposed cysteine residue present in certain kinases such as EGFR (Cys 797) and ERBB2 (Cys 805). The covalent nature of these compounds allows them to achieve greater occupancy of the ATP-site relative to the reversible inhibitors providing the ability to inhibit EGFR T790M, despite increased ATP affinity conferred by this secondary mutation. However, current irreversible inhibitors are 10-140 fold worse at inhibiting the growth of models harboring EGFR T790M compared to those with just an EGFR activating mutation. See FIG. 1 . Furthermore as the ATP affinity of EGFR T790M is similar to WT EGFR, the concentration of an irreversible EGFR inhibitor required to inhibit EGFR T790M can also effectively inhibit WT EGFR. The class-specific toxicities of current EGFR kinase inhibitors, e.g., skin rash and diarrhea, are a result of inhibiting WT EGFR in non-cancer tissues. To date, the clinical efficacy of the irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors EKB-569, CI-1033 (also known as canertinib), HKI-272 (also known as neratinib) and PF00299804 has been limited, especially in gefitinib/erlotinib resistant NSCLC patients, and the dose limiting toxicity for this class of agents includes diarrhea and skin rash.
The present invention provides compounds that are up to 100-fold more potent than current irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors against drug resistant EGFR in vivo. Moreover, they are up to 100-fold less potent than current irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors against wild type EGFR. In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention are about 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, 30-, 40-, 50-, 60-, 70-, 80-, 90- or 100-fold more selective for EGFR activating and the T790M resistance mutation relative to wild-type EGFR.

Compositions for oral delivery can be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs for example. Orally administered compositions can contain one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving a compound of the invention are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time-delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be useful. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.
The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents.
In another embodiment, the compositions can be formulated for intravenous administration. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.
In another embodiment, the compositions can be formulated for intranasal form via use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration can be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons.

V. Methods for Treating or Preventing a Condition
As inhibitors of Her kinases, the compounds and compositions of this invention are particularly useful for treating, lessening the severity of, or preventing a disease that is mediated by a kinase (hereinafter a “Condition”).
In one embodiment, the invention encompasses methods for treating or preventing a Condition in a subject, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of Formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, III, IIIa, IIIb, IV, IVa, IVb, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VI, VIa, VIb, VIII, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX, IXa, IXb, Xb, XI, XIa, XIb, XII, XIIa, or XIIb, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or prodrug thereof.
In one embodiment, the Condition is a disease that is mediated by a kinase. In one embodiment, the kinase comprises a cysteine residue. In a further embodiment, the cysteine residue is located in or near the position equivalent to Cys 797 in epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”), including Jak3, Blk, Bmx, Btk, HER2 (ErbB2), HER4 (ErbB4), Itk, Tec, and Txk.
In one embodiment, the Condition is a disease that is mediated by EGFR. In a further embodiment, the EGFR is a Her-kinase. In a further embodiment, the disease is mediated by HER1, HER2, or HER4.
In one embodiment, the Condition is an EGFR-tyrosine kinase (“EGFR-TK”) related disease. An EGFR-TK related disease is a disease that involves inappropriate EGFR-TK activity or over-activity of the EGFR-TK. Inappropriate activity refers to either; (i) EGFR-TK expression in cells which normally do not express EGFR-TKs; (ii) increased EGFR-TK expression leading to unwanted cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth; or, (iii) decreased EGFR-TK expression leading to unwanted reductions in cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth. Over-activity of EGFR-TKs refers to either amplification of the gene encoding a particular EGFR-TK or production of a level of EGFR-TK activity which can correlate with a cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth disorder (that is, as the level of the EGFR-TK increases, the severity of one or more of the symptoms of the cellular disorder increases). Over activity can also be the result of ligand independent or constitutive activation as a result of mutations such as deletions of a fragment of a EGFR-TK responsible for ligand binding. In some embodiments, the EGFR-TK related diseases and disorders comprise proliferative disorders, e.g., cancers.
In one embodiment, the Condition is a disease that is resistant to EGFR targeted therapy. In one embodiment, the EGFR targeted therapy comprises treatment with gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, XL-647, HKI-272, BIBW2992, AV-412, CI-1033, PF00299804, BMS 690514, cetuximab, panitumumab, or matuzumab.

Chemotherapeutic agents encompass a wide range of therapeutic treatments in the field of oncology. These agents are administered at various stages of the disease for the purposes of shrinking tumors, destroying remaining cancer cells left over after surgery, inducing remission, maintaining remission and/or alleviating symptoms relating to the cancer or its treatment. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents such as mustard gas derivatives (Mechlorethamine, cylophosphamide, chlorambucil, melphalan, ifosfamide), ethylenimines (thiotepa, hexamethylmelanine), Alkylsulfonates (Busulfan), Hydrazines and Triazines (Altretamine, Procarbazine, Dacarbazine and Temozolomide), Nitrosoureas (Carmustine, Lomustine and Streptozocin), Ifosfamide and metal salts (Carboplatin, Cisplatin, and Oxaliplatin); plant alkaloids such as Podophyllotoxins (Etoposide and Tenisopide), Taxanes (Paclitaxel and Docetaxel), Vinca alkaloids (Vincristine, Vinblastine, Vindesine and Vinorelbine), and Camptothecan analogs (Irinotecan and Topotecan); anti-tumor antibiotics such as Chromomycins (Dactinomycin and Plicamycin), Anthracyclines (Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin, Epirubicin, Mitoxantrone, Valrubicin and Idarubicin), and miscellaneous antibiotics such as Mitomycin, Actinomycin and Bleomycin; anti-metabolites such as folic acid antagonists (Methotrexate, Pemetrexed, Raltitrexed, Aminopterin), pyrimidine antagonists (5-Fluorouracil, Floxuridine, Cytarabine, Capecitabine, and Gemcitabine), purine antagonists (6-Mercaptopurine and 6-Thioguanine) and adenosine deaminase inhibitors (Cladribine, Fludarabine, Mercaptopurine, Clofarabine, Thioguanine, Nelarabine and Pentostatin); topoisomerase inhibitors such as topoisomerase I inhibitors (Ironotecan, topotecan) and topoisomerase II inhibitors (Amsacrine, etoposide, etoposide phosphate, teniposide); monoclonal antibodies (Alemtuzumab, Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Rituximab, Trastuzumab, Ibritumomab Tioxetan, Cetuximab, Panitumumab, Tositumomab, Bevacizumab); and miscellaneous anti-neoplastics such as ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors (Hydroxyurea); adrenocortical steroid inhibitor (Mitotane); enzymes (Asparaginase and Pegaspargase); anti-microtubule agents (Estramustine); and retinoids (Bexarotene, Isotretinoin, Tretinoin (ATRA).
In certain preferred embodiments, the compounds of the invention are administered in combination with a chemoprotective agent. Chemoprotective agents act to protect the body or minimize the side effects of chemotherapy. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to, amfostine, mesna, and dexrazoxane.
In one aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are administered in combination with radiation therapy. Radiation is commonly delivered internally (implantation of radioactive material near cancer site) or externally from a machine that employs photon (x-ray or gamma-ray) or particle radiation. Where the combination therapy further comprises radiation treatment, the radiation treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and radiation treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the radiation treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.
It will be appreciated that compounds of the invention can be used in combination with an immunotherapeutic agent, such as agents used to transfer the immunity of an immune donor, e.g., another person or an animal, to a host by inoculation. The term embraces the use of serum or gamma globulin containing performed antibodies produced by another individual or an animal; nonspecific systemic stimulation; adjuvants; active specific immunotherapy; and adoptive immunotherapy. Adoptive immunotherapy refers to the treatment of a disease by therapy or agents that include host inoculation of sensitized lymphocytes, transfer factor, immune RNA, or antibodies in serum or gamma globulin.
One form of immunotherapy is the generation of an active systemic tumor-specific immune response of host origin by administering a vaccine composition at a site distant from the tumor. Various types of vaccines have been proposed, including isolated tumor-antigen vaccines and anti-idiotype vaccines. Another approach is to use tumor cells from the subject to be treated, or a derivative of such cells (reviewed by Schirrmacher et al. (1995) J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 121:487). In U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,596, Hanna Jr. et al. claim a method for treating a respectable carcinoma to prevent recurrence or metastases, comprising surgically removing the tumor, dispersing the cells with collagenase, irradiating the cells, and vaccinating the patient with at least three consecutive doses of about 107 cells. The compounds of the invention can be used in conjunction with such techniques.
It will be appreciated that the compounds of the invention may advantageously be used in conjunction with one or more adjunctive therapeutic agents. Examples of suitable agents for adjunctive therapy include a 5HT1 agonist, such as a triptan (e.g. sumatriptan or naratriptan); an adenosine A1 agonist; an EP ligand; an NMDA modulator, such as a glycine antagonist; a sodium channel blocker (e.g. lamotrigine); a substance P antagonist (e.g. an NK1 antagonist); a cannabinoid; acetaminophen or phenacetin; a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; a leukotriene receptor antagonist; a DMARD (e.g. methotrexate); gabapentin and related compounds; a tricyclic antidepressant (e.g. amitryptilline); a neurone stabilising antiepileptic drug; a mono-aminergic uptake inhibitor (e.g. venlafaxine); a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, such as an iNOS or an nNOS inhibitor; an inhibitor of the release, or action, of tumour necrosis factor a; an antibody therapy, such as a monoclonal antibody therapy; an antiviral agent, such as a nucleoside inhibitor (e.g. lamivudine) or an immune system modulator (e.g. interferon); an opioid analgesic; a local anaesthetic; a stimulant, including caffeine; an H2-antagonist (e.g. ranitidine); a proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole); an antacid (e.g. aluminium or magnesium hydroxide; an antiflatulent (e.g. simethicone); a decongestant (e.g. phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline, epinephrine, naphazoline, xylometazoline, propylhexedrine, or levo-desoxyephedrine); an antitussive (e.g. codeine, hydrocodone, carmiphen, carbetapentane, or dextramethorphan); a diuretic; or a sedating or non-sedating antihistamine.
In another aspect, the invention provides a kit comprising a compound of Formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, III, IIa, IIIb, IV, IVa, IVb, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VII, VIIa, VIIb, VIII, VIIIa, VIM, IX, IXa, IXb, Xb, XI, XIa, XIb, XII, XIIa, or XIIb, and instructions for use in treating a Condition, e.g., a cancer. In one embodiment, the kit further comprises an additional therapeutic agent.
VI. Other Uses
As inhibitors of Her kinases, the compounds and compositions of this invention are also useful in biological samples. One aspect of the invention relates to inhibiting protein kinase activity in a biological sample, which method comprises contacting said biological sample with a compound of the invention or a composition comprising said compound. The term “biological sample,” as used herein, means an in vitro or an ex vivo sample, including, without limitation, cell cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied material obtained from a mammal or extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or other body fluids or extracts thereof. Inhibition of protein kinase activity in a biological sample is useful for a variety of purposes that are known to one of skill in the art. Examples of such purposes include, but are not limited to, blood transfusion, organ-transplantation, and biological specimen storage.
Another aspect of this invention relates to the study of Her kinases in biological and pathological phenomena; the study of intracellular signal transduction pathways mediated by such protein kinases; and the comparative evaluation of new protein kinase inhibitors. Examples of such uses include, but are not limited to, biological assays such as enzyme assays and cell-based assays.
The activity of the compounds as Her kinase inhibitors may be assayed in vitro, in vivo or in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of either the kinase activity or ATPase activity of the activated kinase. Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to bind to the protein kinase and may be measured either by radiolabelling the inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/kinase complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound, or by running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with the kinase bound to known radioligands.

After cell lysis, lysates are centrifuged at 16,000×g for 5 min at 4° C. The supernatant is used for subsequent procedures. Western blot analyses are conducted after separation by SDS/PAGE electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting is performed according to the antibody manufacturers' recommendations. Antibody binding is detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (New England Nuclear Life Science Products Inc.). Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-total Akt, and anti-EGFR antibodies are obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The phospho-specific EGFR (pY1068), total ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2 (pT185/pY187) antibodies are purchased from Biosource International Inc.
(b) Cell Proliferation and Growth Assays
Growth and inhibition of growth is assessed by MTS assay. This assay, a colorimetric method for determining the number of viable cells, is based on the bioreduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) by cells to a formazan product that is soluble in cell culture medium, can be detected spectrophotometrically and was performed according to previously established methods (Mukohara, T. et al. J Natl Cancer Inst 97, 1185-94 (2005); Paez, J. G. et al. Science 304, 1497 500 (2004); Engelman, J. A. et al. J Clin Invest 116, 2695-2706 (2006). NSCLC or Ba/F3 cells are exposed to treatment for 72 hours and the number of cells used per experiment determined empirically and has been previously established. All experimental points are set up in six to twelve wells and all experiments are repeated at least three times. The data is graphically displayed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows, (GraphPad Software; www.graphpad.com). The curves are fitted using a non-linear regression model with a sigmoidal dose response.
(c) Mass Spectrometry
For intact protein mass spectral analysis, the proteins T790M alone and with small molecules bound are injected onto a POROS 20 R2 protein trap and desalted with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at a flow rate of 100 μL/min. The proteins are eluted into the mass spectrometer using a linear 15%-75% (v/v) acetonitrile gradient over 4 min at 50 μL/min using a Shimadzu HPLC system (LC-10ADvp). Intact protein analyses are performed on an LCT-Premier instrument (Waters Corp., Milford, Mass., USA) equipped with a standard electrospray source. The capillary voltage is 3.2 kV and the cone voltage of 35 V. Nitrogen is used as desolvation gas. A source temperature of 175° C. and a desolvation temperature of 80° C. are applied. The instrument is calibrated by infusing a solution of 500 fmol/μL myoglobin and the mass accuracy is less than 10 ppm.
(d) Pepsin Digestion and Peptide Analysis
For the elucidation of the modification site, all three proteins (50 pmol each) are digested offline with pepsin in an enzyme: substrate ratio of 1:1. The pepsin digestion is performed in a potassium phosphate buffer (75 mM KH2PO4/75 mM K2HPO4) pH 2.5. The reaction is carried out for 5 minutes on ice. The resulting peptides are injected into a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, Mass.) and trapped and desalted for 3 min at 100 μL/min and then separated in 60 min by an 8%-40% acetonitrile:water gradient at 40 μL/min. The separation column is a 1.0×100.0 mm ACQUITY UPLC C18 BEH (Waters) containing 1.7 μm particles.
Mass spectra are obtained with a Waters QTOF Premier equipped with standard ESI source (Waters Corp., Milford, Mass., USA). The instrument configuration is the following: capillary was 3.5 kV, trap collision energy at 6V, sampling cone at 37 V, source temperature of 100° C. and desolvation temperature of 250° C. Mass spectra are acquired over an m/z range of 100 to 2000. Mass accuracy was ensured by calibration with 100 fmol/μL GFP, and is less than 10 ppm throughout all experiments. Identification of the peptic fragments is accomplished through a combination of exact mass analysis and MSE12 using custom Identity Software from the Waters Corporation. MSE is performed by a series of low-high collision energies ramping from 5-25 V, therefore ensuring proper fragmentation of all the peptic peptides eluting from the LC system.
(e) In-Vitro Inhibitory Enzyme Kinetic Assays
The assays are carried out in triplicate using the ATP/NADH coupled assay system in a 96-well format as previously described. Yun, C. H. et al., Cancer Cell 11, 217-227 (2007). The final reaction mixture contains 0.5 mg/mL Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), 2 mM MnCl2, 1 mM phospho(enol) pyruvic acid (PEP, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. P7002), 1 mM TCEP, 0.1M Hepes 7.4, 2.5 mM poly-[Glu4Tyr1] peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. P7244), 1/50 of the final reaction mixture volume of pyruvate kinase/lactic dehydrogenase enzymes from rabbit muscle (Sigma-Aldrich; catalogue no. P-0294), 0.5 mM NADH, 0.5 μM EGFR kinase, 100 μM ATP and varied amount of inhibitors. Inhibitors and ATP are mixed and made separate stock from the mixture with all other ingredients and added last to the latter to start the reaction. Steady state initial velocity data are drawn from the slopes of the A340 curves.
An additional EGFR kinase assay is performed using a GST-kinase fusion protein according to the manufacturer's recommended conditions (catalogue number 7908; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass.). The final reaction mixture contains 60 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 3 mM Na3VO4, 1.25 mM DTT, 20 μM ATP, 1.5 μM PTP1B (Tyr66) biotinylated peptide and 50 ng of EGFR kinase. A phospho-tyrosine mab (pTyr100) is used to detect phosphorylation of the EGFR substrate peptide in the presence of a compound of the invention, gefitinib or HKI-272 (concentration ranges 0-10 μM for all drugs) followed a fluorescent Anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Fluorescence emission is detected at 615 nm.
(f) Equilibrium Binding Assay
Dissociation constants for binding of a compound of the invention to WT or mutant EGFR kinases are measured using the equilibrium fluorescence quenching method as previously described, Yun, C. H. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105, 2070-2075 (2008), except that inhibitor stock solutions are prepared in degassed water at concentrations of 500 μM (for wild-type EGFR), 250 μM (for T790M and L858R mutants), or 125 μM (for L858R/T790M mutant).
(g) ENU Mutagenesis Assay
N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis is carried out as previously described. Bradeen, H. A. et al., Blood 108, 2332-2338 (2006). Briefly, L858R or DelE746_A750 Ba/F3 cells (1×106 cells/ml) are exposed to ENU (50 μg/ml) for 24 hours. Cells are then washed 3 times with RPMI, and expanded in growth media for 5-7 days. Cells are subsequently cultured in 96-well plates (1×104 cells/well; total 5×105 cells per inhibitor) in the presence of 100 nM of a compound of the invention, 200 nM HKI-272 or 1 μM gefitnib. Wells are observed for growth by visual inspection and resistant wells were expanded in the presence of the corresponding inhibitor. Total RNA is isolated from the resistant cell lines using Trizol™ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and purified using RNeasy™ minielute cleanup kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). cDNA is transcribed from 2 μg of total RNA with Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen Life technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.). The cDNA is used as template for subsequent sequencing of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (exons 18-21).
Example 2: In Vivo Assays
(a) Generation of Mouse Cohorts and Treatment with a Compound of the Invention
EGFR-TL (T790M/L858R) mice are generated as previously described (Li, D. et al. Cancer Cell 12, 81-93 (2007)). EGFR exon 19 Deletion-T790M (TD) inducible bitransgenic mice are similarly generated and characterized. Briefly, exon 19 deletion is introduced in the human EGFR gene through site directed mutagenesis in the pTRE2-hyg-EGFR-T790M. The constructs are then digested with XhoI to release the entire allele containing Tet-op-EGFR TD-beta-globin PolyA. Transgenic mice are then generated by injection of the construct into FVB/N fertilized eggs. Progeny are genotyped through PCR exactly the same as reported. Founders are crossed with CCSP-rtTA mice and inducible bitransgenic mice with high and inducible expression of the mutant hEGFR transgene were identified and expanded for subsequent analyses and experiments. All mice are housed in a pathogen-free environment at the Harvard School of Public Health and are handled in strict accordance with Good Animal Practice as defined by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, and all animal work is done with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute IACUC approval.
Cohorts of EGFR TL/CCSP-rtTA and EGFR TD/CCSP-rtTA are put on doxycycline diet at 5 weeks of age to induce the expression of mutant EGFR. These mice undergo MRI after 6 to 8 weeks of doxycycline diet to document and quantify the lung cancer burden before being assigned to various treatment study cohorts. There is a minimum of 3 mice per treatment group. Mice are then treated either with vehicle (NMP (10% 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone: 90% PEG-300) alone or WZ4002 at 25 mg/kg gavage daily. After 2 weeks of treatment, these mice undergo a second round of MRI to document their response to the treatment. MRIs and tumor burden measurement are performed as described previously (Li, D. et al. Cancer Cell 12, 81-93 (2007); Ji, H. et al. Cancer Cell 9, 485-95 (2006)).

Matrix size of 128×128 and a field of view (FOV) of 2.5 cm×2.5 cm2 are used for all imaging. With same geometry and described above, the mice are also imaged with a gradient echo fast imaging (GEFI) sequence (TR=180 ms, TE effect=2.2 ms) with respiratory and cardiac gating, in both coronal and axial planes. The detailed procedure for MRI scanning has been previously described (Li, D. et al. Cancer Cell 12, 81-93 (2007); Ji, H. et al. Cancer Cell 9, 485-95 (2006)).
