BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to novel biphenyl compounds having muscarinic receptor antagonist or anticholinergic activity. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such biphenyl compounds, processes and intermediates for preparing such biphenyl compounds and methods of using such biphenyl compounds to treat pulmonary disorders.
State of the Art
Pulmonary or respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, afflict many millions of people worldwide and such disorders are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.
Muscarinic receptor antagonists are known to provide bronchoprotective effects and therefore, such compounds are useful for treating respiratory disorders, such as COPD and asthma. When used to treat such disorders, muscarinic receptor antagonists are typically administered by inhalation. However, even when administered by inhalation, a significant amount of the muscarinic receptor antagonist is often absorbed into the systemic circulation resulting in systemic side effects, such as dry mouth, mydriasis and cardiovascular side effects.
Additionally, many inhaled muscarinic receptor antagonists have a relatively short duration of action requiring that they be administered several times per day. Such a multiple-daily dosing regime is not only inconvenient but also creates a significant risk of inadequate treatment due to patient non-compliance with the required frequent dosing schedule.
Accordingly, a need exists for new muscarinic receptor antagonists. In particular, a need exists for new muscarinic receptor antagonists that having high potency and reduced systemic side effects when administered by inhalation. Additionally, a need exists for inhaled muscarinic receptor antagonists having a long duration of action thereby allowing for once-daily or even once-weekly dosing. Such compounds are expected to be particularly effective for treating pulmonary disorders, such as COPD and asthma, while reducing or eliminating side effects, such as dry-mouth and constipation.

The present invention provides novel biphenyl compounds having muscarinic receptor antagonist or anticholinergic activity. Among other properties, compounds of this invention have been found to possess high potency and reduced systemic side effects when administered by inhalation and to have a long duration of action.

Although a particular embodiment of the present invention may be shown or described herein, those skilled in the art will recognize that all embodiments or aspects of the present invention can be prepared using the methods described herein or by using other methods, reagents and starting materials known to those skilled in the art. It will also be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. While the optimum reaction conditions may vary depending on the particular reactants or solvent used, such conditions can be readily determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.
Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary or desired to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection of such functional groups are well-known in the art. Protecting groups other than those illustrated in the procedures described herein may be used, if desired. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein.
By way of illustration, the compounds of formula I can be prepared by a process comprising:

Generally, if a salt of one of the starting materials is used in the processes described above, such as an acid addition salt, the salt is typically neutralized before or during the reaction process. This neutralization reaction is typically accomplished by contacting the salt with one molar equivalent of a base for each molar equivalent of acid addition salt.
In process (a), the reaction between the compounds of formula II and III, the leaving represented by Z1 can be, for example, halo, such as chloro, bromo or iodo, or a sulfonic ester group, such as mesylate or tosylate. The reaction is conveniently performed in the presence of a base, for example, a tertiary amine such as diisopropylethylamine. Convenient solvents include nitriles, such as acetonitrile.

Compounds of formula II are generally known in the art, or can be prepared by deprotecting a compound of formula X: wherein P1 represents an amino-protecting group, such as a benzyl group. Benzyl groups are conveniently removed by reduction, using a hydrogen or ammonium formate and a Group VIII metal catalyst, such as palladium. When W represents NWa, the hydrogenation is conveniently performed using Pearlman's catalyst (Pd(OH)2).

Compounds in which Z1 represents a hydroxyl group may be prepared, for example, by reacting a compound of formula V with an appropriate amino-substituted alcohol, such as 2-aminoethanol or 3-aminopropan-1-ol.
In process (b), a compound of formula IV is reacted with a compound of formula V or reactive derivative thereof. By “reactive derivative” of compound V, it is meant that the carboxylic acid is activated, for example, by forming an anhydride or carboxylic acid halide, such as a carboxylic acid chloride. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid can be activated using conventional carboxylic acid/amine coupling reagents, such carbodiimides, O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′ tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and the like. This reaction is conveniently performed under conventional amide bond-forming conditions. The process is conveniently conducted at a temperature in the range of from −10° C. to 100° C.
Compounds of formula IV can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula II with a compound of formula XIII:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
OHC(CH2)mCH2NR4P2  XIII
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
wherein P2 represents hydrogen or an amino-protecting group, such as benzyl, in the presence of a reducing agent, such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, followed if necessary by removing the amino-protecting group P2 by, for example, hydrogenation in the presence of palladium.
Compounds of formula V can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VII with a compound of formula XIV: wherein P3 represents hydrogen or a carboxyl-protecting group, such as methyl or ethyl, and Z3 represents a leaving group, followed if necessary by removing the carboxyl protecting group P3. Alternatively, such compounds can be prepared by reductive amination of a compound of formula XV: with a compound of formula VII under conventional reaction conditions, such as those described for processes (d) and (e).
Referring to process (c), the leaving group represented by Z2 can be, for example, halo, such as chloro, bromo or iodo, or a sulfonic ester group, such as mesylate or tosylate. This reaction is conveniently performed in the presence of a base, for example, a tertiary amine such as diisopropylethylamine. Convenient solvents include nitriles, such as acetonitrile. The reaction is conveniently conducted at a temperature in the range of from 0° C. to 100° C. The compounds of formula VI can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula IV with a compound of formula XVI: or a reactive derivative thereof, such as an acid chloride or anhydride. The reaction is conveniently performed following, for example, the method of process (b) described herein. Compounds of formula VII are generally known or can be prepared from readily available starting materials using well-known synthetic methods.
In process (d), the reducing agent may be, for example, hydrogen in the presence of a Group VIII metal catalyst, such as palladium, or a metal hydride reducing agent, such as a borohydride, including sodium triacetoxyborohydride. Convenient solvents include alcohols, such as methanol. The reaction is conveniently performed at a temperature in the range of from 0° C. to 100° C. The compounds of formula VIII may be prepared by oxidizing a compound corresponding to formula III in which Z1 represents a hydroxyl group. Such oxidation reactions can be conducted, for example, using sulfur dioxide pyridine complex in dimethylsulfoxide in the presence of a tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethylamine.
In process (e), the reducing agent may be, for example, hydrogen in the presence of a Group VIII metal catalyst, such as palladium, or a metal hydride reducing agent including borohydrides, such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, optionally used in combination with a titanium tetraalkoxide, such as titanium tetraisopropoxide. Convenient solvents include alcohols, such as methanol and halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane. The reaction is conveniently performed at a temperature in the range of from 0° C. to 100° C. Compounds of formula IX may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula IV with a compound of formula XVII: in the presence of a carboxylic acid/amine coupling agent, such as 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT) and the like.
Referring to process (f), compounds of formula XVIII may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula IX with a compound of formula VII in the presence of a reducing agent, such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, similar to that done in process (e).
As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, compounds of formula I prepared by any of steps (a) to (f) herein may be further derivatized to form other compounds of formula I using methods and reagents well-known in the art. By way of illustration, a compound of formula I may be reacted with bromine to afford a corresponding compound of formula I in which R2, for example, represents a bromo group. Additionally, a compound of formula I in which R4 represents a hydrogen atom may be alkylated to afford a corresponding compound of formula I in which R4 represents a (1-4C) alkyl group.
Certain of the intermediates described herein are believed to be novel and accordingly, such compounds are provided as further aspects of the invention including, for example, the compounds of formula III, V, and VIII, and salts thereof.

It will be understood that any form of the compounds of this invention, (i.e., free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, etc.) that is suitable for the particular mode of administration can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions discussed herein.
Accordingly, in one of its composition aspects, this invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof. Optionally, such pharmaceutical compositions may contain other therapeutic and/or formulating agents if desired.
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention typically contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof. Typically, such pharmaceutical compositions will contain from about 0.01 to about 95% by weight of the active agent; including, from about 0.01 to about 30% by weight; such as from about 0.01 to about 10% by weight of the active agent.
Any conventional carrier or excipient may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention. The choice of a particular carrier or excipient, or combinations of carriers or excipients, will depend on the mode of administration being used to treat a particular patient or type of medical condition or disease state. In this regard, the preparation of a suitable pharmaceutical composition for a particular mode of administration is well within the scope of those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts. Additionally, the ingredients for such compositions are commercially available from, for example, Sigma, P.O. Box 14508, St. Louis, Mo. 63178. By way of further illustration, conventional formulation techniques are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, Lippincott Williams & White, Baltimore, Md. (2000); and H. C. Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7th Edition, Lippincott Williams & White, Baltimore, Md. (1999).
Representative examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) phosphate buffer solutions; (21) compressed propellant gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons; and (22) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical compositions.
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are typically prepared by thoroughly and intimately mixing or blending a compound of the invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and one or more optional ingredients. If necessary or desired, the resulting uniformly blended mixture can then be shaped or loaded into tablets, capsules, pills, canisters, cartridges, dispensers and the like using conventional procedures and equipment.
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are suitable for inhaled administration. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for inhaled administration will typically be in the form of an aerosol or a powder. Such compositions are generally administered using well-known delivery devices, such as a nebulizer inhaler, a metered-dose inhaler (MDI), a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or a similar delivery device.
In a specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a nebulizer inhaler. Such nebulizer devices typically produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent to spray as a mist that is carried into the patient's respiratory tract. Accordingly, when formulated for use in a nebulizer inhaler, the active agent is typically dissolved in a suitable carrier to form a solution. Alternatively, the active agent can be micronized and combined with a suitable carrier to form a suspension of micronized particles of respirable size, where micronized is typically defined as having about 90% or more of the particles with a diameter of less than about 10 μm. Suitable nebulizer devices are provided commercially, for example, by PARI GmbH (Starnberg, German). Other nebulizer devices include Respimat (Boehringer Ingelheim) and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,123,068 to Lloyd et al. and WO 97/12687 (Eicher et al.).
A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a nebulizer inhaler comprises an isotonic aqueous solution comprising from about 0.05 μg/mL to about 10 mg/mL of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof.
In another specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a dry powder inhaler. Such dry powder inhalers typically administer the active agent as a free-flowing powder that is dispersed in a patient's air-stream during inspiration. In order to achieve a free flowing powder, the active agent is typically formulated with a suitable excipient such as lactose or starch.
A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a dry powder inhaler comprises dry lactose having a particle size between about 1 μm and about 100 μm and micronized particles of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof.
Such a dry powder formulation can be made, for example, by combining the lactose with the active agent and then dry blending the components. Alternatively, if desired, the active agent can be formulated without an excipient. The pharmaceutical composition is then typically loaded into a dry powder dispenser, or into inhalation cartridges or capsules for use with a dry powder delivery device.
Examples of dry powder inhaler delivery devices include Diskhaler (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, N.C.) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,035,237 to Newell et al.); Diskus (GlaxoSmithKline) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,378,519 to Davies et al.); Turbuhaler (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del.) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,524,769 to Wetterlin); Rotahaler (GlaxoSmithKline) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,353,365 to Hallworth et al.) and Handihaler (Boehringer Ingelheim). Further examples of suitable DPI devices are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,415,162 to Casper et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,239,993 to Evans, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,715,810 to Armstrong et al., and references cited therein.
In yet another specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a metered-dose inhaler. Such metered-dose inhalers typically discharge a measured amount of the active agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof using compressed propellant gas. Accordingly, pharmaceutical compositions administered using a metered-dose inhaler typically comprise a solution or suspension of the active agent in a liquefied propellant. Any suitable liquefied propellant may be employed including chlorofluorocarbons, such as CCl3F, and hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs), such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134a) and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane, (HFA 227). Due to concerns about chlorofluorocarbons affecting the ozone layer, formulations containing HFAs are generally preferred. Additional optional components of HFA formulations include co-solvents, such as ethanol or pentane, and surfactants, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, lecithin, and glycerin. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,183 to Purewal et al., EP 0717987 A2 (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company), and WO 92/22286 (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company).
A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a metered-dose inhaler comprises from about 0.01% to about 5% by weight of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof; from about 0% to about 20% by weight ethanol; and from about 0% to about 5% by weight surfactant; with the remainder being an HFA propellant.
Such compositions are typically prepared by adding chilled or pressurized hydrofluoroalkane to a suitable container containing the active agent, ethanol (if present) and the surfactant (if present). To prepare a suspension, the active agent is micronized and then combined with the propellant. The formulation is then loaded into an aerosol canister, which forms a portion of a metered-dose inhaler device. Examples of metered-dose inhaler devices developed specifically for use with HFA propellants are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 6,006,745 to Marecki and U.S. Pat. No. 6,143,277 to Ashurst et al. Alternatively, a suspension formulation can be prepared by spray drying a coating of surfactant on micronized particles of the active agent. See, for example, WO 99/53901 (Glaxo Group Ltd.) and WO 00/61108 (Glaxo Group Ltd.).
For additional examples of processes of preparing respirable particles, and formulations and devices suitable for inhalation dosing see U.S. Pat. No. 6,268,533 to Gao et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,983,956 to Trofast, U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,063 to Briggner et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,221,398 to Jakupovic et al.; and WO 99/55319 (Glaxo Group Ltd.) and WO 00/30614 (AstraZeneca AB).

In addition, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may optionally contain opacifying agents and may be formulated so that they release the active ingredient only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.
Suitable liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, by way of illustration, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. Such liquid dosage forms typically comprise the active ingredient and an inert diluent, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (e.g., cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Suspensions, in addition to the active ingredient, may contain suspending agents such as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminium metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.
When intended for oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are preferably packaged in a unit dosage form. The term “unit dosage form” means a physically discrete unit suitable for dosing a patient, i.e., each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active agent calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect either alone or in combination with one or more additional units. For example, such unit dosage forms may be capsules, tablets, pills, and the like.
The compounds of this invention can also be administered transdermally using known transdermal delivery systems and excipients. For example, a compound of this invention can be admixed with permeation enhancers, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol monolaurate, azacycloalkan-2-ones and the like, and incorporated into a patch or similar delivery system. Additional excipients including gelling agents, emulsifiers and buffers, may be used in such transdermal compositions if desired.
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also contain other therapeutic agents that are co-administered with a compound of formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof. For example, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may further comprise one or more therapeutic agents selected from other bronchodilators (e.g., PDE3 inhibitors, adenosine 2b modulators and β2 adrenergic receptor agonists); anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and PDE4 inhibitors); other muscarinic receptor antagonists (i.e., anticholinergic agents); antiinfective agents (e.g., Gram positive and Gram negative antibiotics or antivirals); antihistamines; protease inhibitors; and afferent blockers (e.g., D2 agonists and neurokinin modulators).

Utility
The biphenyl compounds of this invention are expected to be useful as muscarinic receptor antagonists and therefore, such compounds are expected to be useful for treating medical conditions mediated by muscarinic receptors, i.e., medical conditions which are ameliorated by treatment with a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Such medical conditions include, by way of example, pulmonary disorders or diseases including those associated with reversible airway obstruction, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic and wheezy bronchitis and emphysema), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, allergic rhinitis, rhinorrhea, and the like. Other medical conditions that can be treated with muscarinic receptor antagonists are genitourinary tract disorders, such as overactive bladder or detrusor hyperactivity and their symptoms; gastrointestinal tract disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular disease, achalasia, gastrointestinal hypermotility disorders and diarrhea; cardiac arrhythmias, such as sinus bradycardia; Parkinson's disease; cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease; dismenorrhea; and the like.
In one embodiment, the compounds of this invention are useful for treating smooth muscle disorders in mammals, including humans and their companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats etc.). Such smooth muscle disorders include, by way of illustration, overactive bladder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and irritable bowel syndrome.
When used to treat smooth muscle disorders or other conditions mediated by muscarinic receptors, the compounds of this invention will typically be administered orally, rectally, parenterally or by inhalation in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. The amount of active agent administered per dose or the total amount administered per day will typically be determined by the patient's physician and will depend on such factors as the nature and severity of the patients condition, the condition being treated, the age and general health of the patient, the tolerance of the patient to the active agent, the route of administration and the like.
Typically, suitable doses for treating smooth muscle disorders or other disorders mediated by muscarinic receptors will range from about 0.14 μg/kg/day to about 7 mg/kg/day of active agent; including from about 0.15 μg/kg/day to about 5 mg/kg/day. For an average 70 kg human, this would amount to about 10 μg per day to about 500 mg per day of active agent.
In a specific embodiment, the compounds of this invention are useful for treating pulmonary or respiratory disorders, such as COPD or asthma, in mammals including humans. When used to treat such disorders, the compounds of this invention will typically be administered by inhalation in multiple doses per day, in a single daily dose or a single weekly dose. Generally, the dose for treating a pulmonary disorder will range from about 10 μg/day to about 200 μg/day. As used herein, COPD includes chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphysema (see, for example, Barnes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, N Engl J Med 343:269-78 (2000)).
When used to treat a pulmonary disorder, the compounds of this invention are optionally administered in combination with other therapeutic agents such as a β2-adrenoreceptor agonist; a corticosteroid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, or combinations thereof.
When administered by inhalation, the compounds of this invention typically have the effect of producing bronchodilation. Accordingly, in another of its method aspects, this invention is directed to a method of producing bronchodilation in a patient, the method comprising administering to a patient a bronchodilation-producing amount of a compound of the invention. Generally, the therapeutically effective dose for producing bronchodilation will range from about 10 μg/day to about 200 μg/day.
In another embodiment, the compounds of this invention are used to treat overactive bladder. When used to treat overactive bladder, the compounds of this invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day; preferably in a single daily dose. Preferably, the dose for treating overactive bladder will range from about 1.0 to about 500 mg/day.
In yet another embodiment, the compounds of this invention are used to treat irritable bowel syndrome. When used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, the compounds of this invention will typically be administered orally or rectally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. Preferably, the dose for treating irritable bowel syndrome will range from about 1.0 to about 500 mg/day.
Since compounds of this invention are muscarinic receptor antagonists, such compounds are also useful as research tools for investigating or studying biological systems or samples having muscarinic receptors. Such biological systems or samples may comprise M1, M2, M3, M4 and/or M5 muscarinic receptors. Any suitable biological system or sample having muscarinic receptors may be employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo. Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, etc.), and the like.
In this embodiment, a biological system or sample comprising a muscarinic receptor is contacted with a muscarinic receptor-antagonizing amount of a compound of this invention. The effects of antagonizing the muscarinic receptor are then determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as radioligand binding assays and functional assays. Such functional assays include ligand-mediated changes in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), ligand-mediated changes in activity of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (which synthesizes cAMP), ligand-mediated changes in incorporation of guanosine 5′-O-(γ-thio)triphosphate ([35S]GTPγS) into isolated membranes via receptor catalyzed exchange of [35S]GTPγS for GDP, ligand-mediated changes in free intracellular calcium ions (measured, for example, with a fluorescence-linked imaging plate reader or FLIPR® from Molecular Devices, Inc.). A compound of this invention will antagonize or decrease the activation of muscarinic receptors in any of the functional assays listed above, or assays of a similar nature. A muscarinic receptor-antagonizing amount of a compound of this invention will typically range from about 0.1 nanomolar to about 100 nanomolar.
Additionally, the compounds of this invention can be used as research tools for discovering new compounds that have muscarinic receptor antagonist activity. In this embodiment, muscarinic receptor binding data (e.g., as determined by in vitro radioligand displacement assays) for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the muscarinic receptor binding data for a compound of this invention to identify those test compounds that have about equal or superior muscarinic receptor binding, if any. This aspect of the invention includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and the analysis of the test data to identify test compounds of interest.
In another embodiment, the compounds of this invention are used to antagonize a muscarinic receptor in biological system, and a mammal in particular, such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, humans and so forth. In this embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula I is administered to the mammal. The effects of antagonizing the muscarinic receptor can then determined using conventional procedures and equipment, examples of which are described above.
Among other properties, compounds of this invention have been found to be potent inhibitors of M3 muscarinic receptor activity.

Assay 1
Radioligand Binding Assay
A. Membrane Preparation from Cells Expressing hM1, hM2, hM3 and hM4 Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes
CHO cell lines stably expressing cloned human hM1, hM2, hM3 and hM4 muscarinic receptor subtypes, respectively, were grown to near confluency in medium consisting of HAM's F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 250 μg/mL Geneticin. The cells were grown in a 5% CO2, 37° C. incubator and lifted with 2 mM EDTA in dPBS. Cells were collected by 5 minute centrifugation at 650×g, and cell pellets were either stored frozen at −80° C. or membranes were prepared immediately. For membrane preparation, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and homogenized with a Polytron PT-2100 tissue disrupter (Kinematica AG; 20 seconds×2 bursts). Crude membranes were centrifuged at 40,000×g for 15 minutes at 4° C. The membrane pellet was then resuspended with resuspension buffer and homogenized again with the Polytron tissue disrupter. The protein concentration of the membrane suspension was determined by the method described in Lowry, O. et al., Journal of Biochemistry 193:265 (1951). All membranes were stored frozen in aliquots at −80° C. or used immediately. Aliquots of prepared hM5 receptor membranes were purchased directly from Perkin Elmer and stored at −80° C. until use.
B. Radioligand Binding Assay on Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes hM1, hM2, hM3, hM4 and hM5
Radioligand binding assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates in a total assay volume of 100 μL. CHO cell membranes stably expressing either the hM1, hM2, hM3, hM4 or hM5 muscarinic subtype were diluted in assay buffer to the following specific target protein concentrations (g/well): 10 μg for hM1, 10-15 μg for hM2, 10-20 μg for hM3, 10-20 μg for hM4, and 10-12 μg for hM5. The membranes were briefly homogenized using a Polytron tissue disruptor (10 seconds) prior to assay plate addition. Saturation binding studies for determining KD values of the radioligand were performed using L-[N-methyl-3H]scopolamine methyl chloride ([3H]-NMS) (TRK666, 84.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England) at concentrations ranging from 0.001 nM to 20 nM. Displacement assays for determination of Ki values of test compounds were performed with [3H]-NMS at 1 nM and eleven different test compound concentrations. The test compounds were initially dissolved to a concentration of 400 μM in dilution buffer and then serially diluted 5× with dilution buffer to final concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 100 μM. The addition order and volumes to the assay plates were as follows: 25 μL radioligand, 25 μL diluted test compound, and 50 μL membranes. Assay plates were incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/B glass fiber filter plates (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, Mass.) pre-treated in 1% BSA. Filter plates were rinsed three times with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES) to remove unbound radioactivity. Plates were then air dried, and 50 μL Microscint-20 liquid scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, Mass.) was added to each well. The plates were then counted in a PerkinElmer Topcount liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, Mass.). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) using the one-site competition model. Ki values for test compounds were calculated from observed IC50 values and the KD value of the radioligand using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y; Prusoff W. H. Biochemical Pharmacology 22(23):3099-108 (1973)). Ki values were converted to pKi values to determine the geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals. These summary statistics were then converted back to Ki values for data reporting.
In this assay, a lower Ki value indicates that the test compound has a higher binding affinity for the receptor tested. For example, the compounds of Examples 1 and 2 were found to have a Ki value of less than about 5 nM for the M3 muscarinic receptor subtype in this assay.
Assay 2
Muscarinic Receptor Functional Potency Assays
A. Blockade of Agonist-Mediated Inhibition of cAMP Accumulation
In this assay, the functional potency of a test compound was determined by measuring the ability of the test compound to block oxotremorine-inhibition of forskolin-mediated cAMP accumulation in CHO-K1 cells expressing the hM2 receptor.
cAMP assays were performed in a radioimmunoassay format using the Flashplate Adenylyl Cyclase Activation Assay System with 125I-cAMP (NEN SMP004B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, Mass.), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cells were rinsed once with dPBS and lifted with Trypsin-EDTA solution (0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA) as described in the Cell Culture and Membrane Preparation section above. The detached cells were washed twice by centrifugation at 650×g for five minutes in 50 mLs dPBS. The cell pellet was then re-suspended in 10 mL dPBS, and the cells were counted with a Coulter Z1 Dual Particle Counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). The cells were centrifuged again at 650×g for five minutes and re-suspended in stimulation buffer to an assay concentration of 1.6×106-2.8×106 cells/mL.
The test compound was initially dissolved to a concentration of 400 μM in dilution buffer (dPBS supplemented with 1 mg/mL BSA (0.1%)), and then serially diluted with dilution buffer to final molar concentrations ranging from 100 :M to 0.1 nM. Oxotremorine was diluted in a similar manner.
To measure oxotremorine inhibition of AC activity, 25 μL forskolin (25 μM final concentration diluted in dPBS), 25 μL diluted oxotremorine, and 50 μL cells were added to agonist assay wells. To measure the ability of a test compound to block oxotremorine-inhibited AC activity, 25 μL forskolin and oxotremorine (25 μM and 5 μM final concentrations, respectively, diluted in dPBS), 25 μL diluted test compound, and 50 μL cells were added to remaining assay wells.
Reactions were incubated for 10 minutes at 37° C. and stopped by addition of 100 μL ice-cold detection buffer. Plates were sealed, incubated overnight at room temperature and counted the next morning on a PerkinElmer TopCount liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, Mass.). The amount of cAMP produced (pmol/well) was calculated based on the counts observed for the samples and cAMP standards, as described in the manufacturer's user manual. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) using the non-linear regression, one-site competition equation. The Cheng-Prusoff equation was used to calculate the Ki, using the EC50 of the oxotremorine concentration-response curve and the oxotremorine assay concentration as the KD and [L], respectively. The Ki values were converted to pKi values to determine the geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals. These summary statistics were then converted back to Ki values for data reporting.
In this assay, a lower Ki value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. Exemplary compounds of the invention that were tested in this assay, typically were found to have a Ki value of less than about 10 nM for blockade of oxotremorine-inhibition of forskolin-mediated cAMP accumulation in CHO-K1 cells expressing the hM2 receptor. For example, the compound of Example 1 was found to have a Ki value of less than about 5 nM.
B. Blockade of Agonist-Mediated [35S]GTPγS-Binding
In a second functional assay, the functional potency of test compounds can be determined by measuring the ability of the compounds to block oxotremorine-stimulated [35S]GTPγS-binding in CHO-K1 cells expressing the hM2 receptor.
At the time of use, frozen membranes were thawed and then diluted in assay buffer with a final target tissue concentration of 5-10 μg protein per well. The membranes were briefly homogenized using a Polytron PT-2100 tissue disrupter and then added to the assay plates.
The EC90 value (effective concentration for 90% maximal response) for stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding by the agonist oxotremorine was determined in each experiment.
To determine the ability of a test compound to inhibit oxotremorine-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding, the following was added to each well of 96 well plates: 25 μL of assay buffer with [35S]GTPγS (0.4 nM), 25 μL of oxotremorine (EC90) and GDP (3 μM), 25 μL of diluted test compound and 25 μL CHO cell membranes expressing the hM2 receptor. The assay plates were then incubated at 37° C. for 60 minutes. The assay plates were filtered over 1% BSA-pretreated GF/B filters using a PerkinElmer 96-well harvester. The plates were rinsed with ice-cold wash buffer for 3×3 seconds and then air or vacuum dried. Microscint-20 scintillation liquid (50 μL) was added to each well, and each plate was sealed and radioactivity counted on a topcounter (PerkinElmer). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) using the non-linear regression, one-site competition equation. The Cheng-Prusoff equation was used to calculate the Ki, using the IC50 values of the concentration-response curve for the test compound and the oxotremorine concentration in the assay as the KD and [L], ligand concentration, respectively.
In this assay, a lower Ki value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. Exemplary compounds of the invention that were tested in this assay, typically were found to have a Ki value of less than about 10 nM for blockade of oxotremorine-stimulated [35S]GTPγS-binding in CHO-K1 cells expressing the hM2 receptor. For example, the compound of Example 1 was found to have a Ki value of less than about 5 nM.
C. Blockade of Agonist-Mediated Calcium Release Via FLIPR Assays
Muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1, M3 and M5 receptors), which couple to Gq proteins, activate the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway upon agonist binding to the receptor. As a result, activated PLC hydrolyzes phosphatyl inositol diphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidyl-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which in turn generates calcium release from intracellular stores, i.e., endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum. The FLIPR (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.) assay capitalizes on this increase in intracellular calcium by using a calcium sensitive dye (Fluo-4AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) that fluoresces when free calcium binds. This fluorescence event is measured in real time by the FLIPR, which detects the change in fluorescence from a monolayer of cells cloned with human M1 and M3, and chimpanzee M5 receptors. Antagonist potency can be determined by the ability of antagonists to inhibit agonist-mediated increases in intracellular calcium.
For FLIPR calcium stimulation assays, CHO cells stably expressing the hM1, hM3 and cM5 receptors are seeded into 96-well FLIPR plates the night before the assay is done. Seeded cells are washed twice by Cellwash (MTX Labsystems, Inc.) with FLIPR buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM calcium chloride, 2.5 mM probenecid in HBSS without calcium and magnesium) to remove growth media and leaving 50 L/well of FLIPR buffer. The cells are then incubated with 50 μL/well of 4 μM FLUO-4AM (a 2× solution was made) for 40 minutes at 37° C., 5% carbon dioxide. Following the dye incubation period, cells are washed two times with FLIPR buffer, leaving a final volume of 50 L/well.
To determine antagonist potency, the dose-dependent stimulation of intracellular Ca2+ release for oxotremorine is first determined so that antagonist potency can later be measured against oxotremorine stimulation at an EC90 concentration. Cells are first incubated with compound dilution buffer for 20 minutes, followed by agonist addition, which is performed by the FLIPR. An EC90 value for oxotremorine is generated according to the method detailed in the FLIPR measurement and data reduction section below, in conjunction with the formula ECF=((F/100−F)^1/H)*EC50. An oxotremorine concentration of 3× ECF is prepared in stimulation plates such that an EC90 concentration of oxotremorine is added to each well in the antagonist inhibition assay plates.
The parameters used for the FLIPR are: exposure length of 0.4 seconds, laser strength of 0.5 watts, excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and emission wavelength of 550 nm. Baseline is determined by measuring the change in fluorescence for 10 seconds prior to addition of agonist. Following agonist stimulation, the FLIPR continuously measured the change of fluorescence every 0.5 to 1 second for 1.5 minutes to capture the maximum fluorescence change.
The change of fluorescence is expressed as maximum fluorescence minus baseline fluorescence for each well. The raw data is analyzed against the logarithm of drug concentration by nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) using the built-in model for sigmoidal dose-response. Antagonist Ki values are determined by Prism using the oxotremorine EC50 value as the KD and the oxotremorine EC90 for the ligand concentration according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng & Prusoff, 1973).
In this assay, a lower Ki value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. Exemplary compounds of the invention that were tested in this assay, typically were found to have a Ki value of less than about 10 nM for blockade of agonist-mediated calcium release in CHO cells stably expressing the hM3 receptor. For example, the compound of Example 1 was found to have a Ki value of less than about 5 nM for the hM3 receptor.
Assay 3
Determination of Duration of Bronchoprotection in Guinea Pig Model of Acetylcholine-Induced Bronchoconstriction
This in vivo assay was used to assess the bronchoprotective effects of test compounds exhibiting muscarinic receptor antagonist activity.
Groups of six male guinea pigs (Duncan-Hartley (HsdPoc:DH) Harlan, Madison, Wis.) weighing between 250 and 350 g were individually identified by cage cards. Throughout the study animals were allowed access to food and water ad libitum.
Test compounds were administered via inhalation over 10 minutes in a whole-body exposure dosing chamber (R&S Molds, San Carlos, Calif.). The dosing chambers were arranged so that an aerosol was simultaneously delivered to 6 individual chambers from a central manifold. Guinea pigs were exposed to an aerosol of a test compound or vehicle (WFI). These aerosols were generated from aqueous solutions using an LC Star Nebulizer Set (Model 22F51, PARI Respiratory Equipment, Inc. Midlothian, Va.) driven by a mixture of gases (CO2=5%, O2=21% and N2=74%) at a pressure of 22 psi. The gas flow through the nebulizer at this operating pressure was approximately 3 L/minute. The generated aerosols were driven into the chambers by positive pressure. No dilution air was used during the delivery of aerosolized solutions. During the 10 minute nebulization, approximately 1.8 mL of solution was nebulized. This was measured gravimetrically by comparing pre- and post-nebulization weights of the filled nebulizer.
The bronchoprotective effects of test compounds administered via inhalation were evaluated using whole body plethysmography at 1.5, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-dose.
Forty-five minutes prior to the start of the pulmonary evaluation, each guinea pig was anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (43.75 mg/kg), xylazine (3.50 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1.05 mg/kg). After the surgical site was shaved and cleaned with 70% alcohol, a 2-3 cm midline incision of the ventral aspect of the neck was made. Then, the jugular vein was isolated and cannulated with a saline-filled polyethylene catheter (PE-50, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, Md.) to allow for intravenous infusions of ACh (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) in saline. The trachea was then dissected free and cannulated with a 14 G teflon tube (#NE-014, Small Parts, Miami Lakes, Fla.). If required, anesthesia was maintained by additional intramuscular injections of the aforementioned anesthetic mixture. The depth of anesthesia was monitored and adjusted if the animal responded to pinching of its paw or if the respiration rate was greater than 100 breaths/minute.
Once the cannulations were complete, the animal was placed into a plethysmograph (#PLY3114, Buxco Electronics, Inc., Sharon, Conn.) and an esophageal pressure cannula (PE-160, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, Md.) was inserted to measure pulmonary driving pressure (pressure). The teflon tracheal tube was attached to the opening of the plethysmograph to allow the guinea pig to breathe room air from outside the chamber. The chamber was then sealed. A heating lamp was used to maintain body temperature and the guinea pig's lungs were inflated 3 times with 4 mL of air using a 10 mL calibration syringe (#5520 Series, Hans Rudolph, Kansas City, Mo.) to ensure that the lower airways did not collapse and that the animal did not suffer from hyperventilation.
Once it was determined that baseline values were within the range 0.3-0.9 mL/cm H2O for compliance and within the range 0.1-0.199 cm H2O/mL per second for resistance, the pulmonary evaluation was initiated. A Buxco pulmonary measurement computer program enabled the collection and derivation of pulmonary values.
Starting this program initiated the experimental protocol and data collection. The changes in volume over time that occur within the plethysmograph with each breath were measured via a Buxco pressure transducer. By integrating this signal over time, a measurement of flow was calculated for each breath. This signal, together with the pulmonary driving pressure changes, which were collected using a Sensym pressure transducer (#TRD4100), was connected via a Buxco (MAX 2270) preamplifier to a data collection interface (#'s SFT3400 and SFT3813). All other pulmonary parameters were derived from these two inputs.
Baseline values were collected for 5 minutes, after which time the guinea pigs were challenged with ACh. ACh (0.1 mg/mL) was infused intravenously for 1 minute from a syringe pump (sp210iw, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, Fla.) at the following doses and prescribed times from the start of the experiment: 1.9 μg/minute at 5 minutes, 3.8 μg/minute at 10 minutes, 7.5 μg/minute at 15 minutes, 15.0 μg/minute at 20 minutes, 30 μg/minute at 25 minutes and 60 μg/minute at 30 minutes. If resistance or compliance had not returned to baseline values at 3 minutes following each ACh dose, the guinea pig's lungs were inflated 3 times with 4 mL of air from a 10 mL calibration syringe. Recorded pulmonary parameters included respiration frequency (breaths/minute), compliance (mL/cm H2O) and pulmonary resistance (cm H2O/mL per second). Once the pulmonary function measurements were completed at minute 35 of this protocol, the guinea pig was removed from the plethysmograph and euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation.
The data were evaluated in one or both of the following ways:
(a) Pulmonary resistance (RL, cm H2O/mL per second) was calculated from the ratio of“change in pressure” to “the change in flow.” The RL response to ACh (60 μg/min, IH) was computed for the vehicle and the test compound groups. The mean ACh response in vehicle-treated animals, at each pre-treatment time, was calculated and used to compute % inhibition of ACh response, at the corresponding pre-treatment time, at each test compound dose. Inhibition dose-response curves for ‘RL’ were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation using GraphPad Prism, version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) to estimate bronchoprotective ID50 (dose required to inhibit the ACh (60 μg/min) bronchoconstrictor response by 50%). The equation used was as follows:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
Y=Min+(Max−Min)/(1+10((log ID50−X)*Hillslope))
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
where X is the logarithm of dose, Y is the response (% Inhibition of ACh induced increase in RL). Y starts at Min and approaches asymptotically to Max with a sigmoidal shape.
(b) The quantity PD2, which is defined as the amount of ACh or histamine needed to cause a doubling of the baseline pulmonary resistance, was calculated using the pulmonary resistance values derived from the flow and the pressure over a range of ACh or histamine challenges using the following equation (which is derived from a equation used to calculate PC20 values described in American Thoracic Society. Guidelines for methacholine and exercise challenge testing—1999. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 161: 309-329 (2000)):
where:
C1=concentration of ACh or histamine preceding C2
C2=concentration of ACh or histamine resulting in at least a 2-fold increase in pulmonary resistance (RL)
R0=Baseline RL value
R1=RL value after C1
R2=RL value after C2
An efficacious dose was defined as a dose that limited the bronchrestriction response to a 50 μg/mL dose of ACh to a doubling of the baseline pulmonary resistance (PD2(50)).
Statistical analysis of the data was performed using a two-tailed Students t-test. A P-value <0.05 was considered significant.
Generally, test compounds having a PD2(50) less than about 200 μg/mL for ACh-induced bronchoconstriction at 1.5 hours post-dose in this assay are preferred. For example, the compound of Example 1 was found to have a PD2(50) less than about 200 g/mL for ACh-induced bronchoconstriction at 1.5 hours post-dose.
Assay 4
Inhalation Guinea Pig Salivation Assay
Guinea pigs (Charles River, Wilmington, Mass.) weighing 200-350 g were acclimated to the in-house guinea pig colony for at least 3 days following arrival. Test compound or vehicle were dosed via inhalation (IH) over a 10 minute time period in a pie shaped dosing chamber (R&S Molds, San Carlos, Calif.). Test solutions were dissolved in sterile water and delivered using a nebulizer filled with 5.0 mL of dosing solution. Guinea pigs were restrained in the inhalation chamber for 30 minutes. During this time, guinea pigs were restricted to an area of approximately 110 sq. cm. This space was adequate for the animals to turn freely, reposition themselves, and allow for grooming. Following 20 minutes of acclimation, guinea pigs were exposed to an aerosol generated from a LS Star Nebulizer Set (Model 22F51, PARI Respiratory Equipment, Inc. Midlothian, Va.) driven by house air at a pressure of 22 psi. Upon completion of nebulization, guinea pigs were evaluated at 1.5, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 hrs after treatment.
Guinea pigs were anesthetized one hour before testing with an intramuscular (IM) injection of a mixture of ketamine 43.75 mg/kg, xylazine 3.5 mg/kg, and acepromazine 1.05 mg/kg at an 0.88 mL/kg volume. Animals were placed ventral side up on a heated (37° C.) blanket at a 20 degree incline with their head in a downward slope. A 4-ply 2×2 inch gauze pad (Nu-Gauze General-use sponges, Johnson and Johnson, Arlington, Tex.) was inserted in the guinea pig's mouth. Five minutes later, the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (3.0 mg/kg, SC) was administered and the gauze pad was immediately discarded and replaced by a new pre-weighed gauze pad. Saliva was collected for 10 minutes, at which point the gauze pad was weighed and the difference in weight recorded to determine the amount of accumulated saliva (in mg). The mean amount of saliva collected for animals receiving the vehicle and each dose of test compound was calculated. The vehicle group mean was considered to be 100% salivation. Results were calculated using result means (n=3 or greater). Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated for each dose at each time point using two-way ANOVA. This model is a modified version of the procedure described in Rechter, “Estimation of anticholinergic drug effects in mice by antagonism against pilocarpine-induced salivation” Ata Pharmacol Toxicol 24:243-254 (1996).
The mean weight of saliva in vehicle-treated animals, at each pre-treatment time, was calculated and used to compute % inhibition of salivation, at the corresponding pre-treatment time, at each dose. The inhibition dose-response data were fitted to a four parameter logistic equation using GraphPad Prism, version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) to estimate anti-sialagogue ID50 (dose required to inhibit 50% of pilocarpine-evoked salivation). The equation used was as follows:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"
Y=Min+(Max−Min)/(1+10((log ID50−X)*Hillslope))
description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"
where X is the logarithm of dose, Y is the response (% inhibition of salivation). Y starts at Min and approaches asymptotically to Max with a sigmoidal shape.
The ratio of the anti-sialagogue ID50 to bronchoprotective ID50 was used to compute the apparent lung selectivity index of the test compound. Generally, compounds having an apparent lung selectivity index greater than about 5 are preferred. For example, in this assay, the compound of Example 1 had an apparent lung-selectivity index greater than about 5.
Assay 5
Methacholine-Induced Depressor Responses in Conscious Guinea Pigs
Healthy, adult, male Sprague-Dawley guinea pigs (Harlan, Indianapolis, Ind.), weighing between 200 and 300 g were used in these studies. Under isoflurane anesthesia (to effect), animals were instrumented with common carotid artery and jugular vein catheters (PE-50 tubing). The catheters were exteriorized utilizing a subcutaneous tunnel to the subscapular area. All surgical incisions were sutured with 4-0 Ethicon Silk and the catheters locked with heparin (1000 units/mL). Each animal was administered saline (3 mL, SC) at the end of surgery as well as buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, IM). Animals were allowed to recover on a heating pad before being returned to their holding rooms.
Approximately 18 to 20 hours following surgery, the animals were weighed and the carotid artery catheter on each animal was connected to a transducer for recording arterial pressure. Arterial pressure and heart rate was recorded using a Biopac MP-100 Acquisition System. Animals were allowed to acclimate and stabilize for a period of 20 minutes.
Each animal was challenged with MCh (0.3 mg/kg, IV) administered through the jugular venous line and the cardiovascular response was monitored for 10 minutes. The animals were then placed into the whole body dosing chamber, which was connected to a nebulizer containing the test compound or vehicle solution. The solution was nebulized for 10 minutes using a gas mixture of breathable air and 5% carbon dioxide with a flow rate of 3 liters/minute. The animals were then removed from the whole body chamber and returned to their respective cages. At 1.5 and 24 hours post-dosing, the animals were re-challenged with MCh (0.3 mg/kg, IV) and the hemodynamic response was determined. Thereafter, the animals were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, IV).
MCh produces a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and decrease in heart rate (bradycardia). The peak decrease, from baseline, in MAP (depressor responses) was measured for each MCh challenge (before and after IH dosing). The bradycardic effects were not used for analysis since these responses were not robust and reproducible. The effects of treatment on the MCh responses are expressed as % inhibition (mean+/−SEM) of the control depressor responses. Two-way ANOVA with the appropriate post-hoc test was used to test the effects of treatment and pre-treatment time. The depressor responses to MCh were relatively unchanged at 1.5 and 24 hours after inhalation dosing with vehicle.
The ratio of the anti-depressor ID50 to bronchoprotective ID50 was used to compute apparent lung-selectivity of the test compound. Generally, compounds having an apparent lung-selectivity index greater than 5 are preferred. For example, in this assay, the compound of Example 1 had an apparent lung-selectivity index greater than 5.
