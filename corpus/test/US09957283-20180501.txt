FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present disclosure provides processes for making alkylated arylpiperazine and alkylated arylpiperidine compounds as well as novel intermediate compounds formed during those processes.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The piperazines are a broad class of chemical compounds, many with important pharmacological properties, which contain a core piperazine functional group. Many currently notable pharmaceutical drugs contain a piperazine ring as part of their molecular structure. Examples include: antianginals (ranolazine, trimetazidine); antidepressants (amoxapine, befuraline, buspirone, flesinoxan, gepirone, ipsapirone, nefazodone, piberaline, tandospirone, trazodone, vilazodone, zalospirone); antihistamines (buclizine, meclozine, cinnarizine, cyclizine, hydroxyzine, cetirizine, levocetirizine, niaprazine); antipsychotics (fluphenazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine, prochlorperazine, thiothixene, flupentixol, zuclopenthixol, amperozide, aripiprazole, lurasidone, clozapine, olanzapine, perospirone, ziprasidone); urologicals (sildenafil, vardenafil).
Piperidine is also widely used building block and chemical reagent in the synthesis of organic compounds, including pharmaceuticals. Similar to piperazine, piperidine and its derivatives are ubiquitous building blocks in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. For example, the piperidine structure is found in the following classes of pharmaceuticals: SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) (paroxetine); analeptics/nootropics (stimulants) (methylphenidate, ethylphenidate, pipradrol, desoxypipradrol); SERM (selective estrogen receptor modulators) (raloxifene); vasodilators (minoxidil); neuroleptics (antipsychotics) (risperidone, thioridazine, haloperidol, droperidol, mesoridazine); opioids (pethidine, meperidine, loperamide).
Considering their prevalence in the formation of a variety of important pharmaceutical compounds, there is a need for new and improved processes for making both piperazine and piperidine compounds, including intermediates and derivatives thereof, that minimizes the formation of unwanted by-products and eliminates the need for additional purification steps where product is lost.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present disclosure provides processes for making alkylated arylpiperazine and alkylated arylpiperidine compounds, including intermediates and derivatives thereof. More specifically, the present invention provides processes for making a variety of alkylated arylpiperazine and alkylated arylpiperidine compounds of the general formulas (I) and (VII), respectively, wherein, R1 and R2 are individually selected from hydrogen, unsubstituted alkyl, and substituted alkyl, or R1 and R2 are connected to form a 5 to 8 carbon cyclic ring; n is 0, 1, or 2; Y is NR3R4, OR5, or SR5, where R3 and R4 are individually selected from acyl or sulfonyl, wherein R3 and R4 may be connected to form a substituted or unsubstituted cyclic or bicyclic ring, and wherein R5 is aryl or heteroaryl, or heterocyclic; and Ar is an aryl or heteroaryl group.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, YH is:
In the reaction between compound YH and the cyclic sulfate of formula (II) in the present invention, compound YH is preferably present in the reaction mixture in an amount of from about 1.0 to 2.0 equivalents and, more preferably, from about 1.1 to 1.2 equivalents based on the amount of the cyclic sulfate of formula (II).
The alkylation reaction according to the present invention is preferably carried out in a suitable solvent at a temperature of from about 20° C. to about 120° C. in the presence of a base.
Suitable solvents for this step include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, nitriles, ketones, and mixtures thereof. In preferred embodiments, the solvent is acetonitrile.
Suitable bases for this step include alkali metal carbonates such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, and magnesium carbonate; alkali metal bicarbonates such as sodium bicarbonate, and potassium bicarbonate; preferably an alkali metal carbonate, in particular, potassium carbonate; alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, or calcium hydroxide; alkali metal phosphates such as sodium phosphate or potassium phosphate; and organic amine bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and pyridine. Ammonium salts of the above bases are also suitable. Solid inorganic bases may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more kinds of bases, and may be an anhydrous form or a hydrate thereof. In preferred embodiments, the base employed for this step is potassium carbonate, K2CO3.
The amount of the base used herein is generally about 0.7 mole or more, preferably 1.0 mole or more, per one mole of the total amount of compound YH. The upper limit amount of the solid inorganic base used herein is not limited but an excess amount of base can increase process costs. Accordingly, a practical amount of solid inorganic base is 10 mole or less, preferably 2.0 mole or less, per one mole of the total amount of compound YH.
The progress of the alkylation reaction in the present invention can be monitored by any means known to those skilled in the art such as, for example, gas chromatography (GC) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
The compound of formula (III) may be isolated by any method known to those skilled in the art. In preferred embodiments, however, the compound of formula (III) is not isolated from the reaction mixture in which it was formed, but rather is telescoped. In this regard, the compound of formula (III) may be readied for a hydrolysis step by the addition of water, which generates a clean phase split with, for example, acetonitrile due to the solubilized base such as, for example, potassium carbonate, without significant product loss. The organic solvent layer is then preferably washed further with aqueous NaCl in a conventional extraction process to remove any residual carbonate prior to a hydrolysis reaction.
An unexpected benefit of employing a cyclic sulfate of formula (II) in the process of the present invention is that it leads to the advantageous selective monoalkylation of the cyclic sulfate without the possibility of double alkylation. The anionic ring-opened sulfate (after initial alkylation) is not prone to further displacement by nucleophiles. Thus, after conversion of the alcohol to a suitable leaving group, simple displacement chemistry is employed to provide the final product. In other words, the process of the present invention produces alkylated arylpiperazine and alkylated arylpiperidine compounds wherein no bis-imide product is detected in the alkylation of the cyclic sulfate.
The process for making the alkylated arylpiperazine and arylpiperidine derivative compounds according to the present invention also comprises the step of hydrolyzing a compound of formula (III) to form an alcohol of formula (IV) as shown here.
In this reaction step, aqueous acid is added to a washed organic solvent layer containing the compound of formula (III) and the mixture is agitated at a temperature of from about 20° C. to about 100° C. During this step, the sulfate ester moiety of the compound of formula (III) is hydrolyzed to an alcohol group (—OH). In some embodiments, an additional solvent such as, for example, toluene, may be added to the mixture prior to the aqueous acid.
The progress of the hydrolysis reaction in the present invention can be monitored by any means known to those skilled in the art such as, for example, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Preferably, once the reaction is complete, the organic phase is cooled and the organic phase is prepared for another step in the process of the present invention. This preparation typically involves washing several times with water employing a conventional extraction process. The organic phase may also be distilled under vacuum followed by addition of the desired solvent for the next step of the process. An example of such solvent is toluene.
The process of the present invention for making alkylated arylpiperazine and alkylated arylpiperidine compounds also comprises a step of converting the compound of formula (IV) to an alkylating agent of formula (V) wherein LG is a leaving group.
In the compound of formula (V), preferably LG is selected from the group consisting of an aryl sulfonate, alkyl sulfonate, phosphate, phosphonate, proazaphosphatrane and a halogen. In preferred embodiments, LG is a mesylate.
The conversion of the hydroxyl group to one of the recited leaving groups can be effected by any means known to one skilled in the art. In preferred embodiments where LG is a mesylate, for example, it was found that the conversion can occur quickly and effectively in a mixture of toluene and a base such as, for example, triethylamine. In this embodiment, about 1.2 equivalents of methanesulfonyl chloride relative to the alcohol is added to the mixture to initiate the reaction. Other suitable solvents for this step include, for example, hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, nitriles, ketones, and mixtures thereof.
The progress of the conversion reaction in the present invention can be monitored by any means known to those skilled in the art such as, for example, HPLC. Such a reaction typically requires from about 0.5 hours to about 12 hours for completion, depending on variables such as, for example, temperature, equivalents of activating agent, and concentration of the reactants. For example, the less solvent employed the faster the reaction is likely to proceed.

Preparation of the organic phase for the next step in the process of the present invention can be accomplished by vacuum distillation until the desired volume is reached.
The process of making alkylated arylpiperazine compounds according to the present invention comprises a step of alkylating a piperazine compound of formula (VI) with an alkylating agent of formula (V) to provide the alkylated arylpiperazine of formula (I).
In the reaction between the compounds of formula (V) and (VI) in the present invention, the compound of formula (VI) is preferably present in the reaction mixture in an amount of from 1.0 to 10.0 equivalents and, more preferably, from 1.1 to 1.2 equivalents based on the amount of the compound of formula (V). Also present in the reaction is about 1.5 equivalents of a base. Suitable bases for this step include alkali metal carbonates such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, and magnesium carbonate; alkali metal bicarbonates such as sodium bicarbonate, and potassium bicarbonate; preferably an alkali metal carbonate, in particular, potassium carbonate; alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, or calcium hydroxide; alkali metal phosphates such as sodium phosphate or potassium phosphate; and organic amine bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and pyridine. Ammonium salts of the above bases are also suitable. Solid inorganic bases may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more kinds of bases, and may be an anhydrous form or a hydrate thereof. In preferred embodiments, the base employed for this step is potassium carbonate, K2CO3. The amount of the base used herein is generally about 0.7 mole or more, preferably 1.0 mole or more, per one mole of the total amount of compound of formula (VI). The upper limit amount of the solid inorganic base used herein is not limited, but, in case that the amount is too much, the process cost increases. Accordingly, a practical amount of the base is 3 mole or less, preferably 2.0 mole or less, per one mole of the total amount of compound of formula (VI).
The progress of the reaction can be monitored by any means known to those skilled in the art such as, for example, HPLC.
Once complete, the reaction mixture is preferably cooled followed by addition of solvent. The aqueous layer is removed followed by additional washes of the organic phase with water. Once the aqueous layer is separated, the organic layer is preferably distilled under vacuum and an antisolvent is added. Suitable antisolvents for this step include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, nitriles, ketones, and mixtures thereof. To effect crystallization of the arylpiperazine of formula (I), the mixture is preferably successively heated and cooled in the mixture of solvent and antisolvent.
The process of making alkylated arylpiperidine compounds according to the present invention comprises a step of alkylating an arylpiperidine compound of formula (VIII) with an alkylating agent of formula (V) to provide the alkylated arylpiperidine of formula (VII).
