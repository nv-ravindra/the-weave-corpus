BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
The present disclosure provides substituted isoxazole carboxamides as SMYD protein inhibitors, such as SMYD3 and SMYD2 inhibitors, and therapeutic methods of treating conditions and diseases wherein inhibition of SMYD proteins such as SMYD3 and SMYD2 provides a benefit.
Background
Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is an important biological determinant of protein production and cellular differentiation and plays a significant pathogenic role in a number of human diseases. Epigenetic regulation involves heritable modification of genetic material without changing its nucleotide sequence. Typically, epigenetic regulation is mediated by selective and reversible modification (e.g., methylation) of DNA and proteins (e.g., histones) that control the conformational transition between transcriptionally active and inactive states of chromatin. These covalent modifications can be controlled by enzymes such as methyltransferases (e.g., SMYD proteins such as SMYD3 and SMYD2), many of which are associated with genetic alterations that can cause human disease, such as proliferative disorders. Thus, there is a need for the development of small molecules that are capable of inhibiting the activity of SMYD proteins such as SMYD3 and SMYD2.

Definitions
For the purpose of the present disclosure, the term “alkyl” as used by itself or as part of another group refers to a straight- or branched-chain aliphatic hydrocarbon containing one to twelve carbon atoms (i.e., C1-12 alkyl) or the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., a C1 alkyl such as methyl, a C2 alkyl such as ethyl, a C3 alkyl such as propyl or isopropyl, etc.). In one embodiment, the alkyl group is chosen from a straight chain C1-4 alkyl group. In another embodiment, the alkyl group is chosen from a branched chain C3-4 alkyl group. In another embodiment, the alkyl group is chosen from a straight or branched chain C3-4 alkyl group. In another embodiment, the alkyl group is partially or completely deuterated, i.e., one or more hydrogen atoms of the alkyl group are replaced with deuterium atoms. Non-limiting exemplary C1-4 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, and iso-butyl.
For the purpose of the present disclosure, the term “cycloalkyl” as used by itself or as part of another group refers to saturated cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons containing one to three rings having from three to twelve carbon atoms (i.e., C3-12 cycloalkyl) or the number of carbons designated. In one embodiment, the cycloalkyl group is cyclopropyl.
The present disclosure encompasses any of the Compounds of the Disclosure being isotopically-labelled (i.e., radiolabeled) by having one or more atoms replaced by an atom having a different atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the disclosed compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H (or deuterium (D)), 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36Cl, respectively, e.g., 3H, 11C, and 14C. In one embodiment, provided is a composition wherein substantially all of the atoms at a position within the Compound of the Disclosure are replaced by an atom having a different atomic mass or mass number. In another embodiment, provided is a composition wherein a portion of the atoms at a position within the Compound of the disclosure are replaced, i.e., the Compound of the Disclosure is enriched at a position with an atom having a different atomic mass or mass number.” Isotopically-labelled Compounds of the Disclosure can be prepared by methods known in the art.
Compounds of the Disclosure may contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms. The present disclosure is meant to encompass the use of all such possible forms, as well as their racemic and resolved forms and mixtures thereof. The individual enantiomers can be separated according to methods known in the art in view of the present disclosure. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that they include both E and Z geometric isomers. All tautomers are intended to be encompassed by the present disclosure as well.
As used herein, the term “stereoisomers” is a general term for all isomers of individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes enantiomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral center that are not mirror images of one another (diastereomers).
The term “chiral center” or “asymmetric carbon atom” refers to a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached.
The terms “enantiomer” and “enantiomeric” refer to a molecule that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image and hence is optically active wherein the enantiomer rotates the plane of polarized light in one direction and its mirror image compound rotates the plane of polarized light in the opposite direction.
The term “racemic” refers to a mixture of equal parts of enantiomers and which mixture is optically inactive.
The term “absolute configuration” refers to the spatial arrangement of the atoms of a chiral molecular entity (or group) and its stereochemical description, e.g., R or S.
The stereochemical terms and conventions used in the specification are meant to be consistent with those described in Pure & Appl. Chem 68:2193 (1996), unless otherwise indicated.
The term “enantiomeric excess” or “ee” refers to a measure for how much of one enantiomer is present compared to the other. For a mixture of R and S enantiomers, the percent enantiomeric excess is defined as |R−S|*100, where R and S are the respective mole or weight fractions of enantiomers in a mixture such that R+S=1. With knowledge of the optical rotation of a chiral substance, the percent enantiomeric excess is defined as ([α]obs/[α]max)*100, where [α]obs is the optical rotation of the mixture of enantiomers and [α]max is the optical rotation of the pure enantiomer. Determination of enantiomeric excess is possible using a variety of analytical techniques, including NMR spectroscopy, chiral column chromatography or optical polarimetry.
The terms “enantiomerically pure” or “enantiopure” refer to a sample of a chiral substance all of whose molecules (within the limits of detection) have the same chirality sense.
The terms “enantiomerically enriched” or “enantioenriched” refer to a sample of a chiral substance whose enantiomeric ratio is greater than 50:50. Enantiomerically enriched compounds may be enantiomerically pure.
The terms “a” and “an” refer to one or more.
The term “about,” as used herein, includes the recited number ±10%. Thus, “about 10” means 9 to 11.
The present disclosure encompasses the preparation and use of salts of the Compounds of the Disclosure, including non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts include inorganic and organic acid addition salts and basic salts. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, metal salts such as sodium salt, potassium salt, cesium salt and the like; alkaline earth metals such as calcium salt, magnesium salt and the like; organic amine salts such as triethylamine salt, pyridine salt, picoline salt, ethanolamine salt, triethanolamine salt, dicyclohexylamine salt, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine salt and the like; inorganic acid salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, sulphate and the like; organic acid salts such as citrate, lactate, tartrate, maleate, fumarate, mandelate, acetate, dichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate, oxalate, formate and the like; sulfonates such as methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and the like; and amino acid salts such as arginate, asparginate, glutamate and the like. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein, refers to any salt, e.g., obtained by reaction with an acid or a base, of a Compound of the Disclosure that is physiologically tolerated in the target patient (e.g., a mammal, e.g., a human).
Acid addition salts can be formed by mixing a solution of the particular Compound of the Disclosure with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acid such as hydrochloric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid, dichloroacetic acid, or the like. Basic salts can be formed by mixing a solution of the compound of the present disclosure with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, choline hydroxide, sodium carbonate and the like.
The present disclosure encompasses the preparation and use of solvates of Compounds of the Disclosure. Solvates typically do not significantly alter the physiological activity or toxicity of the compounds, and as such may function as pharmacological equivalents. The term “solvate” as used herein is a combination, physical association and/or solvation of a compound of the present disclosure with a solvent molecule such as, e.g. a disolvate, monosolvate or hemisolvate, where the ratio of solvent molecule to compound of the present disclosure is about 2:1, about 1:1 or about 1:2, respectively. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate can be isolated, such as when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. Thus, “solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Compounds of the Disclosure can be present as solvated forms with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the disclosure includes both solvated and unsolvated forms of Compounds of the Disclosure. One type of solvate is a hydrate. A “hydrate” relates to a particular subgroup of solvates where the solvent molecule is water. Solvates typically can function as pharmacological equivalents. Preparation of solvates is known in the art. See, for example, M. Caira et al, J. Pharmaceut. Sci., 93(3):601-611 (2004), which describes the preparation of solvates of fluconazole with ethyl acetate and with water. Similar preparation of solvates, hemisolvates, hydrates, and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al., AAPS Pharm. Sci. Tech., 5(1):Article 12 (2004), and A. L. Bingham et al., Chem. Commun. 603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process of preparing a solvate would involve dissolving a Compound of the Disclosure in a desired solvent (organic, water, or a mixture thereof) at temperatures above 20° C. to about 25° C., then cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals, and isolating the crystals by known methods, e.g., filtration. Analytical techniques such as infrared spectroscopy can be used to confirm the presence of the solvent in a crystal of the solvate.
Since Compounds of the Disclosure are inhibitors of SMYD proteins, such as SMYD3 and SMYD2, a number of diseases, conditions, or disorders mediated by SMYD proteins, such as SMYD3 and SMYD2, can be treated by employing these compounds. The present disclosure is thus directed generally to a method for treating a disease, condition, or disorder responsive to the inhibition of SMYD proteins, such as SMYD3 and SMYD2, in an animal suffering from, or at risk of suffering from, the disorder, the method comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of one or more Compounds of the Disclosure.
In one aspect, the Compounds of the Disclosure are therapeutically effective inhibitors of SMYD proteins by irreversibly binding one or more SMYD proteins such as SMYD3 or SMYD2. In some embodiments, the Compounds of the Disclosure are therapeutically effective inhibitors of SMYD proteins by forming covalent bonds with one or more SMYD proteins such as SMYD3 or SMYD2.
The present disclosure is further directed to a method of inhibiting SMYD proteins in an animal in need thereof, the method comprising administering to the animal a therapeutically effective amount of at least one Compound of the Disclosure.
The present disclosure is further directed to a method of inhibiting SMYD3 in an animal in need thereof, the method comprising administering to the animal a therapeutically effective amount of at least one Compound of the Disclosure.
The present disclosure is further directed to a method of inhibiting SMYD2 in an animal in need thereof, the method comprising administering to the animal a therapeutically effective amount of at least one Compound of the Disclosure.
As used herein, the terms “treat,” “treating,” “treatment,” and the like refer to eliminating, reducing, or ameliorating a disease or condition, and/or symptoms associated therewith. Although not precluded, treating a disease or condition does not require that the disease, condition, or symptoms associated therewith be completely eliminated. As used herein, the terms “treat,” “treating,” “treatment,” and the like may include “prophylactic treatment,” which refers to reducing the probability of redeveloping a disease or condition, or of a recurrence of a previously-controlled disease or condition, in a subject who does not have, but is at risk of or is susceptible to, redeveloping a disease or condition or a recurrence of the disease or condition. The term “treat” and synonyms contemplate administering a therapeutically effective amount of a Compound of the Disclosure to an individual in need of such treatment.
Within the meaning of the disclosure, “treatment” also includes relapse prophylaxis or phase prophylaxis, as well as the treatment of acute or chronic signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions. The treatment can be orientated symptomatically, for example, to suppress symptoms. It can be effected over a short period, be oriented over a medium term, or can be a long-term treatment, for example within the context of a maintenance therapy.
The term “therapeutically effective amount” or “effective dose” as used herein refers to an amount of the active ingredient(s) that is(are) sufficient, when administered by a method of the disclosure, to efficaciously deliver the active ingredient(s) for the treatment of condition or disease of interest to an individual in need thereof. In the case of a cancer or other proliferation disorder, the therapeutically effective amount of the agent may reduce (i.e., retard to some extent and preferably stop) unwanted cellular proliferation; reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., retard to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., retard to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; modulate protein methylation in the target cells; and/or relieve, to some extent, one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the administered compound or composition prevents growth and/or kills existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic.
The term “container” means any receptacle and closure therefore suitable for storing, shipping, dispensing, and/or handling a pharmaceutical product.
The term “insert” means information accompanying a pharmaceutical product that provides a description of how to administer the product, along with the safety and efficacy data required to allow the physician, pharmacist, and patient to make an informed decision regarding use of the product. The package insert generally is regarded as the “label” for a pharmaceutical product.
The term “disease” or “condition” or “disorder” denotes disturbances and/or anomalies that as a rule are regarded as being pathological conditions or functions, and that can manifest themselves in the form of particular signs, symptoms, and/or malfunctions. As demonstrated below, Compounds of the Disclosure inhibit SMYD proteins, such as SMYD3 and SMYD2 and can be used in treating diseases and conditions such as proliferative diseases, wherein inhibition of SMYD proteins, such as SMYD3 and SMYD2 provides a benefit.
In some embodiments, the Compounds of the Disclosure can be used to treat a “SMYD protein mediated disorder” (e.g., a SMYD3-mediated disorder or a SMYD2-mediated disorder). A SMYD protein mediated disorder is any pathological condition in which a SMYD protein is know to play a role. In some embodiments, a SMYD-mediated disorder is a proliferative disease.
In some embodiments inhibiting SMYD proteins, such as SMYD3 and SMYD2, is the inhibition of the activity of one or more activities of SMYD proteins such as SMYD3 and SMYD2. In some embodiments, the activity of the SMYD proteins such as SMYD3 and SMYD2 is the ability of the SMYD protein such as SMY3 or SMYD2 to transfer a methylgroup to a target protein (e.g., histone). It should be appreciated that the activity of the one or more SMYD proteins such as SMYD3 and SMYD2 may be inhibited in vivo or in vivo. Examplary levels of inhibition of the activity one or more SMYD proteins such as SMYD3 and SMYD2 include at least 10% inhibition, at least 20% inhibition, at least 30% inhibition, at least 40% inhibition, at least 50% inhibition, at least 60% inhibition, at least 70% inhibition, at least 80% inhibition, at least 90% inhibition, and up to 100% inhibition.
The SMYD (SET and MYND domain) family of lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) plays pivotal roles in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and DNA damage response. The family of human SMYD proteins consists of SMYD1, SMYD2, SMYD3, SMYD4 and SMYD5. SMYD1, SMYD2, and SMYD3 share a high degree of sequence homology and, with the exception of SMYD5, human SMYD proteins harbor at least one C-terminal tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR) domain. (See e.g., Abu-Farha et al. J Mol Cell Biol (2011) 3 (5) 301-308). The SMYD proteins have been found to be linked to various cancers (See e.g., Hamamoto et al. Nat Cell. Biol. 2004, 6: 731-740), Hu et al. Canncer Research 2009, 4067-4072, and Komatsu et al. Carcinogenesis 2009, 301139-1146.)
SMYD3 is a protein methyltransferase found to be expressed at high levels in a number of different cancers (Hamamoto, R., et al., Nat. Cell Biol., 6(8):731-40 (2004)). SMYD3 likely plays a role in the regulation of gene transcription and signal transduction pathways critical for survival of breast, liver, prostate and lung cancer cell lines (Hamamoto, R., et al., Nat. Cell Biol., 6(8):731-40 (2004); Hamamoto, R., et al., Cancer Sci., 97(2):113-8 (2006); Van Aller, G. S., et al., Epigenetics, 7(4):340-3 (2012); Liu, C., et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 105(22):1719-28 (2013); Mazur, P. K., et al., Nature, 510(7504):283-7 (2014)).
Genetic knockdown of SMYD3 leads to a decrease in proliferation of a variety of cancer cell lines (Hamamoto, R., et al., Nat. Cell Biol., 6(8):731-40 (2004); Hamamoto, R., et al., Cancer Sci., 97(2):113-8 (2006); Van Aller, G. S., et al., Epigenetics, 7(4):340-3 (2012); Liu, C., et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 105(22):1719-28 (2013); Mazur, P. K., et al., Nature, 510(7504):283-7 (2014)). Several studies employing RNAi-based technologies have shown that ablation of SMYD3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines greatly reduces cell viability and that its pro-survival role is dependent on its catalytic activity (Hamamoto, R., et al., Nat. Cell Biol., 6(8):731-40 (2004); Van Aller, G. S., et al., Epigenetics, 7(4):340-3 (2012)). Moreover, SMYD3 has also been shown to be a critical mediator of transformation resulting from gain of function mutations in the oncogene, KRAS for both pancreatic and lung adenocarcinoma in mouse models. The dependence of KRAS on SMYD3 was also shown to be dependent on its catalytic activity (Mazur, P. K., et al., Nature, 510(7504):283-7 (2014)).
SMYD2 (SET and MYND domain-containing protein 2) was first characterized as protein that is a member of a sub-family of SET domain containing proteins which catalyze the site-specific transfer of methyl groups onto substrate proteins. SMYD2 was initially shown to have methyltransferase activity towards lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36) but has subsequently been shown to have both histone and non-histone methyltransferase activity.
SMYD2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple cancers. It has been shown to be over-expressed, compared to matched normal samples, in tumors of the breast, cervix, colon, kidney, liver, head and neck, skin, pancreas, ovary, esophagus and prostate, as well as hematologic malignancies such as AML, B- and T-ALL, CLL and MCL, suggesting a role for SMYD2 in the biology of these cancers. More specifically, studies using genetic knock-down of SMYD2 have demonstrated anti-proliferative effects in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), bladder carcinoma and cervical carcinoma cell lines. Moreover, high expression of SMYD2 has been shown to be a poor prognostic factor in both ESCC and pediatric ALL.

A pharmaceutical composition of the present disclosure can contain from about 0.01 to 99 percent by weight, e.g., from about 0.25 to 75 percent by weight, of a Compound of the Disclosure.
A pharmaceutical composition of the present disclosure is manufactured in a manner which itself will be known in view of the instant disclosure, for example, by means of conventional mixing, granulating, dragee-making, dissolving, extrusion, or lyophilizing processes. Thus, pharmaceutical compositions for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compound with solid excipients, optionally grinding the resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired or necessary, to obtain tablets or dragee cores.
Suitable excipients include fillers such as saccharides (for example, lactose, sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol), cellulose preparations, calcium phosphates (for example, tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate), as well as binders such as starch paste (using, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, or potato starch), gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone. If desired, one or more disintegrating agents can be added, such as the above-mentioned starches and also carboxymethyl-starch, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate.
Auxiliaries are typically flow-regulating agents and lubricants such as, for example, silica, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof (e.g., magnesium stearate or calcium stearate), and polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings that are resistant to gastric juices. For this purpose, concentrated saccharide solutions can be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. In order to produce coatings resistant to gastric juices, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose phthalate can be used. Dye stuffs or pigments can be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example, for identification or in order to characterize combinations of active compound doses.
Examples of other pharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, or soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain a compound in the form of granules, which can be mixed with fillers such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers, or in the form of extruded multiparticulates. In soft capsules, the active compounds are preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils or liquid paraffin. In addition, stabilizers can be added.
Possible pharmaceutical preparations for rectal administration include, for example, suppositories, which consist of a combination of one or more active compounds with a suppository base. Suitable suppository bases include natural and synthetic triglycerides, and paraffin hydrocarbons, among others. It is also possible to use gelatin rectal capsules consisting of a combination of active compound with a base material such as, for example, a liquid triglyceride, polyethylene glycol, or paraffin hydrocarbon.
Suitable formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compound in a water-soluble form such as, for example, a water-soluble salt, alkaline solution, or acidic solution. Alternatively, a suspension of the active compound can be prepared as an oily suspension. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles for such as suspension may include fatty oils (for example, sesame oil), synthetic fatty acid esters (for example, ethyl oleate), triglycerides, or a polyethylene glycol such as polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG-400). An aqueous suspension may contain one or more substances to increase the viscosity of the suspension, including, for example, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, and/or dextran. The suspension may optionally contain stabilizers.
In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides kits which comprise a Compound of the Disclosure (or a composition comprising a Compound of the Disclosure) packaged in a manner that facilitates their use to practice methods of the present disclosure.

Molecular Biology
Full-length human SMYD3 isoform 1 (BAB86333) was inserted into a modified pET21b plasmid containing a His6 tag and TEV and SUMO cleavage sites. Because two common variants of SMYD3 exist in the population, site directed mutagenesis was subsequently performed to change amino acid 13 from an asparagine to a lysine, resulting in plasmid pEPZ533. A lysine at position 13 conforms to the more commonly occurring sequence (NP_001161212).
Protein Expression
E. coli (BL21 codonplus RIL strain, Stratagene) were transformed with plasmid pEPZ553 by mixing competent cells and plasmid DNA and incubating on ice for 30 minutes followed by heat shock at 42° C. for 1 minute and cooling on ice for 2 minutes. Transformed cells were grown and selected on LB agar with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 17 μg/mL chloramphenicol at 37° C. overnight. A single clone was used to inoculate 200 mL of LB medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 17 μg/mL chloramphenicol and incubated at 37° C. on an orbital shaker at 180 rpm. Once in log growth, the culture was diluted 1:100 into 2 L of LB medium and grown until OD600 was about 0.3 after which the culture was incubated at 15° C. and 160 rpm. Once OD600 reached about 0.4, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM and the cells were grown overnight at 15° C. and 160 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm, for 4 minutes at 4° C. and stored at −80° C. for purification.
Protein Purification
Expressed full-length human His-tagged SMYD3 protein was purified from cell paste by Nickel affinity chromatography after equilibration of the resin with Buffer A (25 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH7.8). The column was washed with Buffer B (Buffer A plus 20 mM imidazole) and His-tagged SMYD3 was eluted with Buffer C (Buffer A plus 300 mM imidazole). The His tag, TEV and SUMO cleavage sites were removed generating native SMYD3 by addition of ULP1 protein at a ratio of 1:200 (ULP1:SMYD3). Imidazole was removed by dialysis overnight in Buffer A. The dialyzed solution was applied to a second Nickel column and the native SMYD3 protein was collected from the column flow-through. The flow-through was dialyzed in Buffer D (25 mM Tris, 5% glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM NaCl, pH7.8) and ULP1 was removed using a Q sepharose fast flow column. SMYD3 was eluted in Buffer A and further purified using an S200 size-exclusion column equilibrated with Buffer A. SMYD3 was concentrated to 2 mg/mL with a final purity of 89%.

General Procedure for SMYD3 Enzyme Assays on MEKK2 Protein Substrate
The assays were all performed in a buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM TCEP, 0.005% BSG, and 0.005% Tween 20, prepared on the day of use. Compounds in 100% DMSO (1 ul) were spotted into a 384-well white opaque OptiPlate using a Bravo automated liquid handling platform outfitted with a 384-channel head (Agilent Technologies). DMSO (1 ul) was added to Columns 11, 12, 23, 24, rows A-H for the maximum signal control and 1 ul of SAH, a known product and inhibitor of SMYD3, was added to columns 11, 12, 23, 24, rows I-P for the minimum signal control. A cocktail (40 ul) containing the SMYD3 enzyme was added by Multidrop Combi (Thermo-Fisher). The compounds were allowed to incubate with SMYD3 for 30 min at room temperature, then a cocktail (10 ul) containing SAM and MEKK2 was added to initiate the reaction (final volume=51 ul). The final concentrations of the components were as follows: SMYD3 was 0.4 nM, 3H-SAM was 8 nM, MEKK2 was 12 nM, SAH in the minimum signal control wells was 1 mM, and the DMSO concentration was 2%. The assays were stopped by the addition of non-radiolabeled SAM (10 ul) to a final concentration of 100 uM, which dilutes the 3H-SAM to a level where its incorporation into MEKK2 is no longer detectable. Radiolabeled MEKK2 was detected using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA). 10 uL of a 10 mg/mL solution of SPA beads in 0.5 M citric acid was added and the plates centrifuged at 600 rpm for 1 min to precipitate the radiolabeled MEKK2 onto the SPA beads. The plates were then read in a PerkinElmer TopCount plate reader to measure the quantity of 3H-labeled MEKK2 as disintegrations per minute (dpm) or alternatively, referred to as counts per minute (cpm).
Where dpm=disintegrations per minute, cmpd=signal in assay well, and min and max are the respective minimum and maximum signal controls.

Room temperature MEM+10% Tet system FBS was added and cells were mixed gently, and counted using the Vi-cell. Cells were seeded at 100,000 cells/mL in 50 μL MEM/10% Tet FBS/Pen/Strep to a 384 well black/clear poly-D-lysine coated plate containing test agent diluted in DMSO. The final top concentration of test compound was 40 μM. The total concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.2% (v/v). Plates were incubated×30 minutes at RT in low-airflow area, followed by incubation at 37° C. under 5% CO2 for 24 hours. Medium was aspirated from all wells of assay plates prior to fixation and permeabilization with ice cold (−20° C.) methanol (90 μL/well) for ten minutes. Plates were rinsed with PBS three times on BioTek ELx405. PBS was removed with a final aspiration, and Odyssey blocking buffer (50 μL/well) was added to each well and incubated for one hour at RT. Primary antibody solution was prepared (anti-trimethyl-MEKK2 at 1:600 dilution plus mouse anti-flag antibody at 1:10,000 dilution in diluent (Odyssey Blocking buffer+0.1% Tween 20)) and 20 μL per well was dispensed using the Multidrop Combi. Assay plates were then sealed with foil, and incubated overnight at 4° C. Plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween (1×) on Biotek ELx405 and blotted on paper towel to remove excess reagent.

Calculations:
First, the ratio for each well was determined by:
Each plate included fourteen control wells of DMSO only treatment (Minimum Inhibition) as well as fourteen control wells for maximum inhibition (Background). The average of the ratio values for each control type was calculated and used to determine the percent inhibition for each test well in the plate. Reference compound was serially diluted two-fold in DMSO for a total of nine test concentrations, beginning at 40 μM. Percent inhibition was calculated (below).
Non-linear regression curves were generated to calculate the IC50 and dose-response relationship using triplicate wells per concentration of compound.
