BACKGROUND
Field of the Invention
The invention relates to malonic ester derivatives of heteroarylpiperidines and -piperazines, to agrochemically active salts thereof, to use thereof and to methods and compositions for controlling phytopathogenic harmful fungi in and/or on plants or in and/or on seed of plants, to processes for producing such compositions and treated seed, and to use thereof for controlling phytopathogenic harmful fungi in agriculture, horticulture and forestry, in animal health, in the protection of materials and in the domestic and hygiene sector. The present invention further relates to a process for preparing malonic ester derivatives of heteroarylpiperidines and -piperazines.
Description of Related Art
It is already known that particular heterocyclically substituted piperidines and piperazines can be used as fungicidal crop protection compositions (see WO 07/014290, WO 08/013925, WO 08/013622, WO 08/091594, WO 08/091580, WO 09/055514, WO 09/094407, WO 09/094445, WO 09/132785, WO 10/037479, WO 10/065579, WO 11/076510, WO 11/018415, WO 11/018401, WO 11/076699, WO 11/134969, WO 11/146182, WO 11/147765, WO 12/020060, WO 12/055837, WO 12/025557, WO 12/082580, WO 12/104273, WO 13/037768, WO13/098229). However, specifically at relatively low application rates, the fungicidal efficacy of these compounds is not always adequate.
Since the ecological and economical demands made on modern crop protection agents are increasing constantly, for example with respect to activity spectrum, toxicity, selectivity, application rate, formation of residues and favourable manufacture, and there can furthermore be problems, for example, with resistances, there is a constant need to develop novel crop protection compositions, in particular fungicides, which, at least in some areas, have advantages over the known ones.
SUMMARY
It has now been found that, surprisingly, the present malonic ester derivatives of heteroarylpiperidines and -piperazines achieve at least some aspects of the objects mentioned and are suitable for use as crop protection compositions, especially as fungicides.

The malonic ester derivatives of heteroarylpiperidines and -piperazines usable in accordance with the invention are defined in general terms by the formula (I). The radical definitions of the radical definitions above and specified below of the formula (I) apply to the end products of the formula (I), and also equally to all intermediates (see also below under “Elucidations of the processes and intermediates”).
The radical definitions and elucidations listed above and below, in general terms or in areas of preference, can be combined with one another as desired, i.e. including combinations between the particular areas and areas of preference. They apply both to the end products and correspondingly to precursors and intermediates. Moreover, individual definitions may not apply.
The radical definitions specified above can be combined with one another as desired. Moreover, individual definitions may not apply.
According to the type of substituents defined above, the compounds of the formula (I) have acidic or basic properties and can form salts, possibly also internal salts or adducts, with inorganic or organic acids or with bases or with metal ions. If the compounds of the formula (I) bear amino, alkylamino or other groups which induce basic properties, these compounds can be reacted with acids to give salts, or they are obtained directly as salts by the synthesis. If the compounds of the formula (I) bear hydroxyl, carboxyl or other groups which induce acidic properties, these compounds can be reacted with bases to give salts. Suitable bases are, for example, hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogencarbonates of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, especially those of sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium, and also ammonia, primary, secondary and tertiary amines having C1-C4-alkyl groups, mono-, di- and trialkanolamines of C1-C4-alkanols, choline and chlorocholine.
The salts thus obtainable likewise have fungicidal properties.
Examples of inorganic acids are hydrohalic acids, such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid, and acidic salts, such as NaHSO4 and KHSO4. Useful organic acids include, for example, formic acid, carbonic acid and alkanoic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and propionic acid, and also glycolic acid, thiocyanic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, oxalic acid, saturated or mono- or diunsaturated C6-C20 fatty acids, alkylsulphuric monoesters, alkylsulphonic acids (sulphonic acids having straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylsulphonic acids or aryldisulphonic acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphthyl, which bear one or two sulphonic acid groups), alkylphosphonic acids (phosphonic acids having straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylphosphonic acids or aryldiphosphonic acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphthyl, which bear one or two phosphonic acid radicals), where the alkyl and aryl radicals may bear further substituents, for example p-toluenesulphonic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, 2-phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, etc.
Useful metal ions are especially the ions of the elements of the second main group, especially calcium and magnesium, of the third and fourth main group, especially aluminium, tin and lead, and also of the first to eighth transition groups, especially chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and others. Particular preference is given to the metal ions of the elements of the fourth period. Here, the metals can be present in the various valencies that they can assume.
Optionally substituted groups may be mono- or polysubstituted, where the substituents in the case of polysubstitutions may be identical or different.

Process A
The amides (Ia) can be converted by means of methods described in the literature to the corresponding thioamides (Ib) (e.g. Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 2009, 19(2), 462-468) (Process A, Scheme 1). This involves reacting the compounds of the formula (Ia) typically with phosphorus pentasulphide or 2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dithia-2,4-diphosphetane 2,4-disulphide (Lawesson's reagent).
Process A according to the invention is preferably carried out using one or more diluents. The preferred solvents are toluene, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane.
After the reaction has ended, the compounds (Ib) are separated from the reaction mixture by one of the customary separation techniques. If necessary, the compounds are purified by recrystallization or chromatography.
Process B
One means of preparing compounds of the formula (I) from a corresponding thioamide of the formula (IIa) is shown in Scheme 2 (process B).
A thioamide of the formula (IIa) is converted in the presence of a compound of the formula (III) to a compound of the formula (I) by Hantzch thiazole synthesis described in the literature (Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry, 2012, 10, 1093-1101; Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1991, 34, 600-605).
The compound with the general formula (III) can be synthesized analogously to methods well described in the literature (see, for example WO 2008/013925 or WO 2013/098229).
After the reaction has ended, the compounds (I) are separated from the reaction mixture by one of the customary separation techniques. If necessary, the compounds are purified by recrystallization or chromatography, or can, if desired, also be used in the next step without prior purification.
Process C
A nitrile of the formula (IVa) can be converted to the corresponding thioamides (IIa) by thionation (Process C, Scheme 3). The reaction can be performed under appropriate reaction conditions described in the literature (for example, see Synlett, 2009, 2338-2340; Synthesis, 2006, 224-226; Synlett, 2011, 2807-2810; EP696581), and it involves reacting the compounds of the formula (IVa) in the presence of a thionating reagent, for example, hydrogen sulphide or its bisulfide salt with an alkali metal or ammonia, and if necessary in the presence of an acid or a base.
In addition, a nitrile of the formula (IVa) can be hydrolysed first under acidic or basic conditions (for example, with aqueous sodium, potassium or lithium hydroxide solution or with aqueous hydrochloric acid) to a corresponding amide, then converted under an appropriate thionating conditions similar to Process A to a thioamide of the general formula (IIa).
After the reaction has ended, the compounds (IIa) are separated from the reaction mixture by one of the customary separation techniques. If necessary, the compounds are purified by recrystallization or chromatography.

In general, it is possible to prepare compounds of the formula (IVb) from corresponding compounds (IVc) which bear a suitable leaving group W13 for a substitution reaction with a substrate such as A2-H (V), where A2 is defined as above and H is hydrogen (see Scheme 4, Process D).
For the substitution reaction, at least one equivalent of a base (e.g. sodium hydride, potassium carbonate) or an acid scavenger is used in relation to the starting material of the general formula (IVc).
After the reaction has ended, the compounds (IVb) are separated from the reaction mixture by one of the customary separation techniques. If necessary, the compounds are purified by recrystallization or chromatography.
Process E
One means of preparing compounds of the formula (IV) from corresponding compounds (VI) with the compounds (VII) is shown in Scheme 5 (process E).
A compound with the general formula (IV) can be synthesized analogously to methods described in the literature (see, for example WO2008091594), by a coupling reaction of a compound with the corresponding general formula (VI) with a substrate of the general formula (VII) where W1 is chlorine or fluorine, optionally in the presence of an acid scavenger/base.
At least one equivalent of an acid scavenger/a base (for example Hünig's base, triethylamine or commercially available polymeric acid scavengers) is used, in relation to the starting material of the general formula (VI). If the starting material is a salt, at least two equivalents of the acid scavenger are required.
Alternatively, a compound of the formula (IV) can also be synthesized from the corresponding compound of the formula (VI) with a substrate of the formula (VII) where W1 is hydroxyl in the presence of a coupling agent, analogously to methods described in the literature (for example Tetrahedron, 2005, 61, 10827-10852, and references cited therein).
Suitable coupling reagents are, for example, peptide coupling reagents (for example N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide mixed with 4-dimethylaminopyridine, N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide mixed with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, bromotripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate, O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, etc.).
A compound of the formula (VII) is either commercially available or can be prepared by processes described in the literature (see, for example, WO 2008013925, WO2008091580, WO2007014290 and WO2008091594).
Compounds of formula (VI) are either commercially available or can be synthesized analogously to methods described in the literature (for example, Polish Journal of Chemistry, 1988, 62, 451-5; WO2012045124).
After the reaction has ended, the compounds (IV) are separated from the reaction mixture by one of the customary separation techniques. If necessary, the compounds are purified by recrystallization or chromatography.
Process F
In general, it is also possible to prepare compounds of the formula (I) from corresponding compounds (VIII) and (IX) with suitable functional groups Gf and W7 (Scheme 6, Process F). There are numerous literature methods for the preparation of heterocycles (see WO 2008/013622; Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry vol. 4-6, editors: A. R. Katritzky and C. W. Rees, Pergamon Press, New York, 1984; Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II, vol. 2-4, editors: A. R. Katritzky, C. W. Rees and E. F. Scriven, Pergamon Press, New York, 1996; The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, editor: E. C. Taylor, Wiley, New York; Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, vol. 2-4, Elsevier, New York; Synthesis, 1982, 6, 508-509; Tetrahedron, 2000, 56, 1057-1064).
Compounds with the general formula (IX), for example styrenes, are generally commercially available or can be prepared by methods described in the literature.
After the reaction has ended, the compounds (I) are separated from the reaction mixture by one of the customary separation techniques. If necessary, the compounds are purified by recrystallization or chromatography.
Process G
One means of preparing compounds of the formula (VIII) from a corresponding thioamide of the formula (IIa) is shown in Scheme 7 (process G).
A thioamide of the formula (IIa) is converted in the presence of a compound of the formula (X) to a compound of the formula (VIII) by Hantzch thiazole synthesis analogously to Process B (Scheme 2).
The compound with the general formula (X) can be synthesized analogously to methods well described in the literature (see, for example WO 2008013925).
After the reaction has ended, the compounds (VIII) are separated from the reaction mixture by one of the customary separation techniques. If necessary, the compounds are purified by recrystallization or chromatography, or can, if desired, also be used in the next step without prior purification.
It is recognized that the substituent R2 can be converted from one substituent definition to another as specified above, at any appropriate stage of the synthesis, in one or more steps, by synthetic methods commonly used by the person skilled in the art of chemical synthesis. For example, an intermediate or a final product that bears an ester as R2 can be saponified in the presence of an aqueous base or an acid to its corresponding carboxylic acid that can be in turn converted to an amide or another ester by amidation or by esterification.
Furthermore, it is also recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions described above for preparation of compounds of the formula (I) may not be compatible with particular functionalities present in the intermediate compounds. In these cases, the introduction of protection/deprotection sequences or of mutual conversions of functional groups into the synthesis helps to obtain the desired products. The use and selection of the protecting groups is obvious to the person skilled in the art of chemical synthesis (see, for example, “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”; Third Edition; 494-653, and literature cited therein). The person skilled in the art will recognize that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as shown in an individual scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthesis steps not described individually in order to complete the synthesis of compounds of the formula (I). The person skilled in the art will likewise recognize that it may be necessary to perform a combination of the steps illustrated in the above schemes in a sequence other than the implied sequence shown specifically, in order to prepare the compounds of the formula (I).
The workup is carried out by customary methods. If necessary, the compounds are purified by recrystallization or chromatography.
The invention also relates to a method for controlling unwanted microorganisms, characterized in that the inventive heteroarylpiperidine and -piperazine derivatives are applied to the microorganisms and/or in their habitat.
The invention further relates to seed which has been treated with at least one inventive heteroarylpiperidine or -piperazine derivative.
The invention finally provides a method for protecting seed against unwanted microorganisms by using seed treated with at least one inventive heteroarylpiperidine or -piperazine derivative according to the present invention.
The inventive substances have potent microbicidal activity and can be used for control of unwanted microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria, in crop protection and in the protection of materials.
The inventive piperidinecarboxylic acid derivatives of the formula (I) have very good fungicidal properties and can be used in crop protection, for example for control of Plasmodiophoromycetes, Oomycetes, Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes.
Bactericides can be used in crop protection, for example, for control of Pseudomonadaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Corynebacteriaceae and Streptomycetaceae.
The inventive fungicidal compositions can be used for curative or protective control of phytopathogenic fungi. The invention therefore also relates to curative and protective methods for controlling phytopathogenic fungi by the use of the inventive active ingredients or compositions, which are applied to the seed, the plant or plant parts, the fruit or the soil in which the plants grow.
The inventive compositions for controlling phytopathogenic fungi in crop protection comprise an effective but non-phytotoxic amount of the inventive active ingredients. An “effective but non-phytotoxic amount” means an amount of the inventive composition which is sufficient to control the fungal disease of the plant in a satisfactory manner or to eradicate the fungal disease completely, and which, at the same time, does not cause any significant symptoms of phytotoxicity. In general, this application rate may vary within a relatively wide range. It depends on several factors, for example on the fungus to be controlled, the plant, the climatic conditions and the ingredients of the inventive compositions.
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are understood here to mean all plants and plant populations, such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants may be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars which are protectable and non-protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts are understood to mean all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples of which include leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds, and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, slips and seeds.
Composition/Formulation
The present invention further relates to a crop protection composition for controlling harmful microorganisms, especially unwanted fungi and bacteria, comprising an effective and non-phytotoxic amount of the inventive active ingredients. These are preferably fungicidal compositions which comprise agriculturally suitable auxiliaries, solvents, carriers, surfactants or extenders.
In the context of the present invention, “control of harmful microorganisms” means a reduction in infestation by harmful microorganisms, compared with the untreated plant measured as fungicidal efficacy, preferably a reduction by 25-50%, compared with the untreated plant (100%), more preferably a reduction by 40-79%, compared with the untreated plant (100%); even more preferably, the infection by harmful microorganisms is entirely suppressed (by 70-100%). The control may be curative, i.e. for treatment of already infected plants, or protective, for protection of plants which have not yet been infected.
An “effective but non-phytotoxic amount” means an amount of the inventive composition which is sufficient to control the fungal disease of the plant in a satisfactory manner or to eradicate the fungal disease completely, and which, at the same time, does not cause any significant symptoms of phytotoxicity. In general, this application rate may vary within a relatively wide range. It depends on several factors, for example on the fungus to be controlled, the plant, the climatic conditions and the ingredients of the inventive compositions.
Suitable organic solvents include all polar and non-polar organic solvents usually employed for formulation purposes. Preferable the solvents are selected from ketones, e.g. methyl-isobutyl-ketone and cyclohexanone, amides, e.g. dimethyl formamide and alkanecarboxylic acid amides, e.g. N,N-dimethyl decaneamide and N,N-dimethyl octanamide, furthermore cyclic solvents, e.g. N-methyl-pyrrolidone, N-octyl-pyrrolidone, N-dodecyl-pyrrolidone, N-octyl-caprolactame, N-dodecyl-caprolactame and butyrolactone, furthermore strong polar solvents, e.g. dimethylsulfoxide, and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. xylol, Solvesso™, mineral oils, e.g. white spirit, petroleum, alkyl benzenes and spindle oil, also esters, e.g. propyleneglycol-monomethylether acetate, adipic acid dibutylester, acetic acid hexylester, acetic acid heptylester, citric acid tri-n-butylester and phthalic acid di-n-butylester, and also alkohols, e.g. benzyl alcohol and 1-methoxy-2-propanol.
According to the invention, a carrier is a natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic substance with which the active ingredients are mixed or combined for better applicability, in particular for application to plants or plant parts or seed. The carrier, which may be solid or liquid, is generally inert and should be suitable for use in agriculture.
Useful solid or liquid carriers include: for example ammonium salts and natural rock dusts, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and synthetic rock dusts, such as finely divided silica, alumina and natural or synthetic silicates, resins, waxes, solid fertilizers, water, alcohols, especially butanol, organic solvents, mineral and vegetable oils, and derivatives thereof. Mixtures of such carriers can likewise be used.

The presence of a surfactant is necessary if one of the active ingredients and/or one of the inert carriers is insoluble in water and when application is effected in water. The proportion of surfactants is between 5 and 40 percent by weight of the inventive composition.
It is possible to use dyes such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyes such as alizarin dyes, azo dyes and metal phthalocyanine dyes, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.

If appropriate, it is also possible for other additional components to be present, for example protective colloids, binders, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic substances, penetrants, stabilizers, sequestrants, complexing agents. In general, the active ingredients can be combined with any solid or liquid additive commonly used for formulation purposes.

The inventive compositions include not only formulations which are already ready for use and can be applied with a suitable apparatus to the plant or the seed, but also commercial concentrates which have to be diluted with water prior to use. Customary applications are for example dilution in water and subsequent spraying of the resulting spray liquor, application after dilution in oil, direct application without dilution, seed treatment or soil application of granules.
The inventive compositions and formulations generally contain between 0.05 and 99% by weight, 0.01 and 98% by weight, preferably between 0.1 and 95% by weight, more preferably between 0.5 and 90% of active ingredient, most preferably between 10 and 70% by weight. For special applications, e.g. for protection of wood and derived timber products the inventive compositions and formulations generally contain between 0.0001 and 95% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 60% by weight of active ingredient.
The contents of active ingredient in the application forms prepared from the commercial formulations may vary in a broad range. The concentration of the active ingredients in the application forms is generally between 0.000001 to 95% by weight, preferably between 0.0001 and 2% by weight.
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active ingredients with at least one customary extender, solvent or diluent, adjuvant, emulsifier, dispersant, and/or binder or fixative, wetting agent, water repellent, if appropriate desiccants and UV stabilizers and, if appropriate, dyes and pigments, antifoams, preservatives, inorganic and organic thickeners, adhesives, gibberellins and also further processing auxiliaries and also water. Depending on the formulation type to be prepared further processing steps are necessary, e.g. wet grinding, dry grinding and granulation.
The inventive active ingredients may be present as such or in their (commercial) formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations as a mixture with other (known) active ingredients, such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulators, herbicides, fertilizers, safeners and/or semiochemicals.
The inventive treatment of the plants and plant parts with the active ingredients or compositions is effected directly or by action on their surroundings, habitat or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, atomizing, irrigating, evaporating, dusting, fogging, broadcasting, foaming, painting, spreading-on, watering (drenching), drip irrigating and, in the case of propagation material, especially in the case of seeds, also by dry seed treatment, wet seed treatment, slurry treatment, incrustation, coating with one or more coats, etc. It is also possible to deploy the active ingredients by the ultra-low volume method or to inject the active ingredient preparation or the active ingredient itself into the soil.

The inventive fungicidal compositions can be used for curative or protective/preventive control of phytopathogenic fungi. The invention therefore also relates to curative and protective methods for controlling phytopathogenic fungi by the use of the inventive active ingredients or compositions, which are applied to the seed, the plant or plant parts, the fruit or the soil in which the plants grow.
The fact that the active ingredients are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations required for controlling plant diseases allows the treatment of above-ground parts of plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.
According to the invention all plants and plant parts can be treated. By plants is meant all plants and plant populations such as desirable and undesirable wild plants, cultivars and plant varieties (whether or not protectable by plant variety or plant breeder's rights). Cultivars and plant varieties can be plants obtained by conventional propagation and breeding methods which can be assisted or supplemented by one or more biotechnological methods such as by use of double haploids, protoplast fusion, random and directed mutagenesis, molecular or genetic markers or by bioengineering and genetic engineering methods. By plant parts is meant all above ground and below ground parts and organs of plants such as shoot, leaf, blossom and root, whereby for example leaves, needles, stems, branches, blossoms, fruiting bodies, fruits and seed as well as roots, corms and rhizomes are listed. Crops and vegetative and generative propagating material, for example cuttings, corms, rhizomes, runners and seeds also belong to plant parts.
The inventive active ingredients, when they are well tolerated by plants, have favourable homeotherm toxicity and are well tolerated by the environment, are suitable for protecting plants and plant organs, for enhancing harvest yields, for improving the quality of the harvested material. They can preferably be used as crop protection compositions. They are active against normally sensitive and resistant species and against all or some stages of development.
Plants which can be treated in accordance with the invention include the following main crop plants: maize, soya bean, alfalfa, cotton, sunflower, Brassica oil seeds such as Brassica napus (e.g. canola, rapeseed), Brassica rapa, B. juncea (e.g. (field) mustard) and Brassica carinata, Arecaceae sp.

(e.g. okra, cocoa), Papaveraceae (e.g. poppy), Asparagaceae (e.g. asparagus); useful plants and ornamental plants in the garden and woods including turf, lawn, grass and Stevia rebaudiana; and in each case genetically modified types of these plants.
Plant Growth Regulation
In some cases, the inventive compounds can, at particular concentrations or application rates, also be used as herbicides, safeners, growth regulators or agents to improve plant properties, or as microbicides, for example as fungicides, antimycotics, bactericides, viricides (including compositions against viroids) or as compositions against MLO (Mycoplasma-like organisms) and RLO (Rickettsia-like organisms). If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active ingredients.
The inventive active ingredients intervene in the metabolism of the plants and can therefore also be used as growth regulators.
Plant growth regulators may exert various effects on plants. The effect of the substances depends essentially on the time of application in relation to the developmental stage of the plant, and also on the amounts of active ingredient applied to the plants or their environment and on the type of application. In each case, growth regulators should have a particular desired effect on the crop plants.
Plant growth-regulating compounds can be used, for example, to inhibit the vegetative growth of the plants. Such inhibition of growth is of economic interest, for example, in the case of grasses, since it is thus possible to reduce the frequency of grass cutting in ornamental gardens, parks and sport facilities, on roadsides, at airports or in fruit crops. Also of significance is the inhibition of the growth of herbaceous and woody plants on roadsides and in the vicinity of pipelines or overhead cables, or quite generally in areas where vigorous plant growth is unwanted.
Also important is the use of growth regulators for inhibition of the longitudinal growth of cereal. This reduces or completely eliminates the risk of lodging of the plants prior to harvest. In addition, growth regulators in the case of cereals can strengthen the culm, which also counteracts lodging. The employment of growth regulators for shortening and strengthening culms allows the deployment of higher fertilizer volumes to increase the yield, without any risk of lodging of the cereal crop.
In many crop plants, inhibition of vegetative growth allows denser planting, and it is thus possible to achieve higher yields based on the soil surface. Another advantage of the smaller plants obtained in this way is that the crop is easier to cultivate and harvest.
Inhibition of the vegetative plant growth may also lead to enhanced yields because the nutrients and assimilates are of more benefit to flower and fruit formation than to the vegetative parts of the plants.
Frequently, growth regulators can also be used to promote vegetative growth. This is of great benefit when harvesting the vegetative plant parts. However, promoting vegetative growth may also promote generative growth in that more assimilates are formed, resulting in more or larger fruits.
In some cases, yield increases may be achieved by manipulating the metabolism of the plant, without any detectable changes in vegetative growth. In addition, growth regulators can be used to alter the composition of the plants, which in turn may result in an improvement in quality of the harvested products. For example, it is possible to increase the sugar content in sugar beet, sugar cane, pineapples and in citrus fruit, or to increase the protein content in soya or cereals. It is also possible, for example, to use growth regulators to inhibit the degradation of desirable ingredients, for example sugar in sugar beet or sugar cane, before or after harvest. It is also possible to positively influence the production or the elimination of secondary plant ingredients. One example is the stimulation of the flow of latex in rubber trees.
Under the influence of growth regulators, parthenocarpic fruits may be formed. In addition, it is possible to influence the sex of the flowers. It is also possible to produce sterile pollen, which is of great importance in the breeding and production of hybrid seed.
Use of growth regulators can control the branching of the plants. On the one hand, by breaking apical dominance, it is possible to promote the development of side shoots, which may be highly desirable particularly in the cultivation of ornamental plants, also in combination with an inhibition of growth. On the other hand, however, it is also possible to inhibit the growth of the side shoots. This effect is of particular interest, for example, in the cultivation of tobacco or in the cultivation of tomatoes.
Under the influence of growth regulators, the amount of leaves on the plants can be controlled such that defoliation of the plants is achieved at a desired time. Such defoliation plays a major role in the mechanical harvesting of cotton, but is also of interest for facilitating harvesting in other crops, for example in viticulture. Defoliation of the plants can also be undertaken to lower the transpiration of the plants before they are transplanted.
Growth regulators can likewise be used to regulate fruit dehiscence. On the one hand, it is possible to prevent premature fruit dehiscence. On the other hand, it is also possible to promote fruit dehiscence or even flower abortion to achieve a desired mass (“thinning”), in order to eliminate alternation. Alternation is understood to mean the characteristic of some fruit species, for endogenous reasons, to deliver very different yields from year to year. Finally, it is possible to use growth regulators at the time of harvest to reduce the forces required to detach the fruits, in order to allow mechanical harvesting or to facilitate manual harvesting.
Growth regulators can also be used to achieve faster or else delayed ripening of the harvested material before or after harvest. This is particularly advantageous as it allows optimal adjustment to the requirements of the market. Moreover, growth regulators in some cases can improve the fruit colour. In addition, growth regulators can also be used to concentrate maturation within a certain period of time. This establishes the prerequisites for complete mechanical or manual harvesting in a single operation, for example in the case of tobacco, tomatoes or coffee.
By using growth regulators, it is additionally possible to influence the resting of seed or buds of the plants, such that plants such as pineapple or ornamental plants in nurseries, for example, germinate, sprout or flower at a time when they are normally not inclined to do so. In areas where there is a risk of frost, it may be desirable to delay budding or germination of seeds with the aid of growth regulators, in order to avoid damage resulting from late frosts.
Finally, growth regulators can induce resistance of the plants to frost, drought or high salinity of the soil. This allows the cultivation of plants in regions which are normally unsuitable for this purpose.
Resistance Induction/Plant Health and Other Effects
The active compounds according to the invention also exhibit a potent strengthening effect in plants. Accordingly, they can be used for mobilizing the defenses of the plant against attack by undesirable microorganisms.
Plant-strengthening (resistance-inducing) substances are to be understood as meaning, in the present context, those substances which are capable of stimulating the defence system of plants in such a way that the treated plants, when subsequently inoculated with undesirable microorganisms, develop a high degree of resistance to these microorganisms.
The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the yield of crops. In addition, they show reduced toxicity and are well tolerated by plants.
Further, in context with the present invention plant physiology effects comprise the following:
Abiotic stress tolerance, comprising temperature tolerance, drought tolerance and recovery after drought stress, water use efficiency (correlating to reduced water consumption), flood tolerance, ozone stress and UV tolerance, tolerance towards chemicals like heavy metals, salts, pesticides (safener) etc.
Biotic stress tolerance, comprising increased fungal resistance and increased resistance against nematodes, viruses and bacteria. In context with the present invention, biotic stress tolerance preferably comprises increased fungal resistance and increased resistance against nematodes Increased plant vigor, comprising plant health/plant quality and seed vigor, reduced stand failure, improved appearance, increased recovery, improved greening effect and improved photosynthetic efficiency.

Delayed senescence, comprising improvement of plant physiology which is manifested, for example, in a longer grain filling phase, leading to higher yield, a longer duration of green leaf colouration of the plant and thus comprising colour (greening), water content, dryness etc. Accordingly, in the context of the present invention, it has been found that the specific inventive application of the active compound combination makes it possible to prolong the green leaf area duration, which delays the maturation (senescence) of the plant. The main advantage to the farmer is a longer grain filling phase leading to higher yield. There is also an advantage to the farmer on the basis of greater flexibility in the harvesting time.
Therein “sedimentation value” is a measure for protein quality and describes according to Zeleny (Zeleny value) the degree of sedimentation of flour suspended in a lactic acid solution during a standard time interval. This is taken as a measure of the baking quality. Swelling of the gluten fraction of flour in lactic acid solution affects the rate of sedimentation of a flour suspension. Both a higher gluten content and a better gluten quality give rise to slower sedimentation and higher Zeleny test values. The sedimentation value of flour depends on the wheat protein composition and is mostly correlated to the protein content, the wheat hardness, and the volume of pan and hearth loaves. A stronger correlation between loaf volume and Zeleny sedimentation volume compared to SDS sedimentation volume could be due to the protein content influencing both the volume and Zeleny value (Czech J. Food Sci. Vol. 21, No. 3: 91-96, 2000).
Further the “falling number” as mentioned herein is a measure for the baking quality of cereals, especially of wheat. The falling number test indicates that sprout damage may have occurred. It means that changes to the physical properties of the starch portion of the wheat kernel has already happened. Therein, the falling number instrument analyzes viscosity by measuring the resistance of a flour and water paste to a falling plunger. The time (in seconds) for this to happen is known as the falling number. The falling number results are recorded as an index of enzyme activity in a wheat or flour sample and results are expressed in time as seconds. A high falling number (for example, above 300 seconds) indicates minimal enzyme activity and sound quality wheat or flour. A low falling number (for example, below 250 seconds) indicates substantial enzyme activity and sprout-damaged wheat or flour.
The term “more developed root system”/“improved root growth” refers to longer root system, deeper root growth, faster root growth, higher root dry/fresh weight, higher root volume, larger root surface area, bigger root diameter, higher root stability, more root branching, higher number of root hairs, and/or more root tips and can be measured by analyzing the root architecture with suitable methodologies and Image analysis programmes (e.g. WinRhizo).
The term “crop water use efficiency” refers technically to the mass of agriculture produce per unit water consumed and economically to the value of product(s) produced per unit water volume consumed and can e.g. be measured in terms of yield per ha, biomass of the plants, thousand-kernel mass, and the number of ears per m2.
The term “nitrogen-use efficiency” refers technically to the mass of agriculture produce per unit nitrogen consumed and economically to the value of product(s) produced per unit nitrogen consumed, reflecting uptake and utilization efficiency.
Improvement in greening/improved colour and improved photosynthetic efficiency as well as the delay of senescence can be measured with well-known techniques such as a HandyPea system (Hansatech). Fv/Fm is a parameter widely used to indicate the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII). This parameter is widely considered to be a selective indication of plant photosynthetic performance with healthy samples typically achieving a maximum Fv/Fm value of approx. 0.85. Values lower than this will be observed if a sample has been exposed to some type of biotic or abiotic stress factor which has reduced the capacity for photochemical quenching of energy within PSII. Fv/Fm is presented as a ratio of variable fluorescence (Fv) over the maximum fluorescence value (Fm). The Performance Index is essentially an indicator of sample vitality. (See e.g. Advanced Techniques in Soil Microbiology, 2007, 11, 319-341; Applied Soil Ecology, 2000, 15, 169-182.)
The improvement in greening/improved colour and improved photosynthetic efficiency as well as the delay of senescence can also be assessed by measurement of the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), measurement of the chlorophyll content, e.g. by the pigment extraction method of Ziegler and Ehle, measurement of the photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm ratio), determination of shoot growth and final root and/or canopy biomass, determination of tiller density as well as of root mortality.
Within the context of the present invention preference is given to improving plant physiology effects which are selected from the group comprising: enhanced root growth/more developed root system, improved greening, improved water use efficiency (correlating to reduced water consumption), improved nutrient use efficiency, comprising especially improved nitrogen (N)-use efficiency, delayed senescence and enhanced yield.
Within the enhancement of yield preference is given as to an improvement in the sedimentation value and the falling number as well as to the improvement of the protein and sugar content—especially with plants selected from the group of cereals (preferably wheat).
Preferably the novel use of the fungicidal compositions of the present invention relates to a combined use of a) preventively and/or curatively controlling pathogenic fungi and/or nematodes, with or without resistance management, and b) at least one of enhanced root growth, improved greening, improved water use efficiency, delayed senescence and enhanced yield. From group b) enhancement of root system, water use efficiency and N-use efficiency is particularly preferred.
Seed Treatment
The invention further comprises a method for treating seed.
The invention further relates to seed which has been treated by one of the methods described in the previous paragraph. The inventive seeds are employed in methods for the protection of seed from harmful microorganisms. In these methods, seed treated with at least one inventive active ingredient is used.
The inventive active ingredients or compositions are also suitable for treating seed. A large part of the damage to crop plants caused by harmful organisms is triggered by the infection of the seed during storage or after sowing, and also during and after germination of the plant. This phase is particularly critical since the roots and shoots of the growing plant are particularly sensitive, and even minor damage may result in the death of the plant. There is therefore a great interest in protecting the seed and the germinating plant by using appropriate compositions.
The control of phytopathogenic fungi by treating the seed of plants has been known for a long time and is the subject of constant improvements. However, the treatment of seed entails a series of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. For instance, it is desirable to develop methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant, which dispense with, or at least significantly reduce, the additional deployment of crop protection compositions after planting or after emergence of the plants. It is also desirable to optimize the amount of the active ingredient used so as to provide the best possible protection for the seed and the germinating plant from attack by phytopathogenic fungi, but without damaging the plant itself by the active ingredient employed. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take account of the intrinsic fungicidal properties of transgenic plants in order to achieve optimal protection of the seed and the germinating plant with a minimum expenditure of crop protection compositions.
The present invention therefore also relates to a method for protection of seed and germinating plants from attack by phytopathogenic fungi, by treating the seed with an inventive composition. The invention likewise relates to the use of the inventive compositions for treatment of seed to protect the seed and the germinating plant from phytopathogenic fungi. The invention further relates to seed which has been treated with an inventive composition for protection from phytopathogenic fungi.
The control of phytopathogenic fungi which damage plants post-emergence is effected primarily by treating the soil and the above-ground parts of plants with crop protection compositions. Owing to the concerns regarding a possible influence of the crop protection compositions on the environment and the health of humans and animals, there are efforts to reduce the amount of active ingredients deployed.
One of the advantages of the present invention is that the particular systemic properties of the inventive active ingredients and compositions mean that treatment of the seed with these active ingredients and compositions not only protects the seed itself, but also the resulting plants after emergence, from phytopathogenic fungi. In this way, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with.
It is likewise considered to be advantageous that the inventive active ingredients or compositions can especially also be used with transgenic seed, in which case the plant growing from this seed is capable of expressing a protein which acts against pests. By virtue of the treatment of such seed with the inventive active ingredients or compositions, merely the expression of the protein, for example an insecticidal protein, can control certain pests. Surprisingly, a further synergistic effect can be observed in this case, which additionally increases the effectiveness for protection against attack by pests.
The inventive compositions are suitable for protecting seed of any plant variety which is used in agriculture, in greenhouses, in forests or in horticulture and viticulture. In particular, this is the seed of cereals (such as wheat, barley, rye, triticale, sorghum/millet and oats), maize, cotton, soya beans, rice, potatoes, sunflower, bean, coffee, beet (for example sugar beet and fodder beet), peanut, oilseed rape, poppy, olive, coconut, cocoa, sugar cane, tobacco, vegetables (such as tomato, cucumbers, onions and lettuce), turf and ornamentals (see also below). The treatment of the seed of cereals (such as wheat, barley, rye, triticale and oats), maize and rice is of particular significance.
As also described below, the treatment of transgenic seed with the inventive active ingredients or compositions is of particular significance. This relates to the seed of plants containing at least one heterologous gene. Definition and examples of suitable heterologous genes are given below.
In the context of the present invention, the inventive composition is applied to the seed alone or in a suitable formulation. Preferably, the seed is treated in a state in which it is sufficiently stable for no damage to occur in the course of treatment. In general, the seed can be treated at any time between harvest and sowing. It is customary to use seed which has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits. For example, it is possible to use seed which has been harvested, cleaned and dried down to a moisture content of less than 15% by weight. Alternatively, it is also possible to use seed which, after drying, for example, has been treated with water and then dried again.
When treating the seed, care must generally be taken that the amount of the inventive composition applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is selected such that the germination of the seed is not impaired, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This has to be borne in mind in particular in the case of active ingredients which can have phytotoxic effects at certain application rates.
The inventive compositions can be applied directly, i.e. without containing any other components and without having been diluted. In general, it is preferable to apply the compositions to the seed in the form of a suitable formulation. Suitable formulations and methods for seed treatment are known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the following documents: U.S. Pat. No. 4,272,417, U.S. Pat. No. 4,245,432, U.S. Pat. No. 4,808,430, U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,739, US 2003/0176428 A1, WO 2002/080675, WO 2002/028186.
The active ingredients usable in accordance with the invention can be converted to the customary seed dressing formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, slurries or other coating compositions for seed, and also ULV formulations.
These formulations are prepared in a known manner, by mixing the active ingredients with customary additives, for example customary extenders and also solvents or diluents, dyes, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, preservatives, secondary thickeners, adhesives, gibberellins and also water.
Useful dyes which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all dyes which are customary for such purposes. It is possible to use either pigments, which are sparingly soluble in water, or dyes, which are soluble in water. Examples include the dyes known by the names Rhodamine B, C.I. Pigment Red 112 and C.I. Solvent Red 1.
Useful wetting agents which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances which promote wetting and which are conventionally used for the formulation of active agrochemical ingredients. Preference is given to using alkyl naphthalenesulphonates, such as diisopropyl or diisobutyl naphthalenesulphonates.
Useful dispersants and/or emulsifiers which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all nonionic, anionic and cationic dispersants conventionally used for the formulation of active agrochemical ingredients. Usable with preference are nonionic or anionic dispersants or mixtures of nonionic or anionic dispersants. Suitable nonionic dispersants include especially ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block polymers, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers and tristryrylphenol polyglycol ether, and the phosphated or sulphated derivatives thereof. Suitable anionic dispersants are especially lignosulphonates, polyacrylic acid salts and arylsulphonate/formaldehyde condensates.
Antifoams which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all foam-inhibiting substances conventionally used for the formulation of active agrochemical ingredients. Silicone antifoams and magnesium stearate can be used with preference.
Preservatives which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances usable for such purposes in agrochemical compositions. Examples include dichlorophene and benzyl alcohol hemiformal.
Secondary thickeners which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances usable for such purposes in agrochemical compositions. Preferred examples include cellulose derivatives, acrylic acid derivatives, xanthan, modified clays and finely divided silica.
Adhesives which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all customary binders usable in seed dressing products. Preferred examples include polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and tylose.
The gibberellins which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention may preferably be gibberellins A1, A3 (=gibberellic acid), A4 and A7; particular preference is given to using gibberellic acid. The gibberellins are known (cf. R. Wegler “Chemie der Pflanzenschutz-und Schädlingsbekäimpfungsmittel” [Chemistry of the Crop Protection Compositions and Pesticides], vol. 2, Springer Verlag, 1970, p. 401-412).
The seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention can be used, either directly or after previously having been diluted with water, for the treatment of a wide range of different seed, including the seed of transgenic plants. In this case, additional synergistic effects may also occur in interaction with the substances formed by expression.
For treatment of seed with the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention, or the preparations prepared therefrom by adding water, all mixing units usable customarily for the seed dressing are useful. Specifically, the procedure in the seed dressing is to place the seed into a mixer, to add the particular desired amount of seed dressing formulations, either as such or after prior dilution with water, and to mix everything until the formulation is distributed homogeneously on the seed. If appropriate, this is followed by a drying process.
Mycotoxins
In addition, the inventive treatment can reduce the mycotoxin content in the harvested material and the foods and feeds prepared therefrom. Mycotoxins include particularly, but not exclusively, the following: deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol, 15-Ac-DON, 3-Ac-DON, T2- and HT2-toxin, fumonisins, zearalenon, moniliformin, fusarin, diaceotoxyscirpenol (DAS), beauvericin, enniatin, fusaroproliferin, fusarenol, ochratoxins, patulin, ergot alkaloids and aflatoxins which can be produced, for example, by the following fungi: Fusarium spec., such as F. acuminatum, F. asiaticum, F. avenaceum, F. crookwellense, F. culmorum, F. graminearum (Gibberella zeae), F. equiseti, F. fujikoroi, F. musarum, F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. poae, F. pseudograminearum, F. sambucinum, F. scirpi, F. semitectum, F. solani, F. sporotrichoides, F. langsethiae, F. subglutinans, F. tricinctum, F. verticillioides etc., and also by Aspergillus spec., such as A. flavus, A. parasiticus, A. nomius, A. ochraceus, A. clavatus, A. terreus, A. versicolor, Penicillium spec., such as P. verrucosum, P. viridicatum, P. citrinum, P. expansum, P. claviforme, P. roqueforti, Claviceps spec., such as C. purpurea, C. fusiformis, C. paspali, C. africana, Stachybotrys spec. and others.
Material Protection
The inventive active ingredients or compositions can also be used in the protection of materials, for protection of industrial materials against attack and destruction by harmful microorganisms, for example fungi and insects.
In addition, the inventive compounds can be used as antifouling compositions, alone or in combinations with other active ingredients.
Industrial materials in the present context are understood to mean inanimate materials which have been prepared for use in industry. For example, industrial materials which are to be protected by inventive active ingredients from microbial alteration or destruction may be adhesives, glues, paper, wallpaper and board/cardboard, textiles, carpets, leather, wood, fibers and tissues, paints and plastic articles, cooling lubricants and other materials which can be infected with or destroyed by microorganisms. Parts of production plants and buildings, for example cooling-water circuits, cooling and heating systems and ventilation and air-conditioning units, which may be impaired by the proliferation of microorganisms may also be mentioned within the scope of the materials to be protected. Industrial materials within the scope of the present invention preferably include adhesives, sizes, paper and card, leather, wood, paints, cooling lubricants and heat transfer fluids, more preferably wood.
The inventive active ingredients or compositions may prevent adverse effects, such as rotting, decay, discoloration, decoloration or formation of mould.
In the case of treatment of wood the compounds/compositions according to the invention may also be used against fungal diseases liable to grow on or inside timber. The term “timber” means all types of species of wood, and all types of working of this wood intended for construction, for example solid wood, high-density wood, laminated wood, and plywood. The method for treating timber according to the invention mainly consists in contacting one or more compounds according to the invention or a composition according to the invention; this includes for example direct application, spraying, dipping, injection or any other suitable means.
In addition, the inventive compounds can be used to protect objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, especially hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, from fouling.
The inventive method for controlling unwanted fungi can also be employed for protecting storage goods. Storage goods are understood to mean natural substances of vegetable or animal origin or processed products thereof which are of natural origin, and for which long-term protection is desired. Storage goods of vegetable origin, for example plants or plant parts, such as stems, leaves, tubers, seeds, fruits, grains, can be protected freshly harvested or after processing by (pre)drying, moistening, comminuting, grinding, pressing or roasting. Storage goods also include timber, both unprocessed, such as construction timber, electricity poles and barriers, or in the form of finished products, such as furniture. Storage goods of animal origin are, for example, hides, leather, furs and hairs. The inventive active ingredients may prevent adverse effects, such as rotting, decay, discoloration, decoloration or formation of mould.
Microorganisms capable of degrading or altering the industrial materials include, for example, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae and slime organisms. The inventive active ingredients preferably act against fungi, especially moulds, wood-discoloring and wood-destroying fungi (Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Deuteromycetes and Zygomycetes), and against slime organisms and algae. Examples include microorganisms of the following genera: Alternaria, such as Alternaria tenuis; Aspergillus, such as Aspergillus niger; Chaetomium, such as Chaetomium globosum; Coniophora, such as Coniophora puetana; Lentinus, such as Lentinus tigrinus; Penicillium, such as Penicillium glaucum; Polyporus, such as Polyporus versicolor; Aureobasidium, such as Aureobasidium pullulans; Sclerophoma, such as Sclerophoma pityophila; Trichoderma, such as Trichoderma viride; Ophiostoma spp., Ceratocystis spp., Humicola spp., Petriella spp., Trichurus spp., Coriolus spp., Gloeophyllum spp., Pleurotus spp., Poria spp., Serpula spp. and Tyromyces spp., Cladosporium spp., Paecilomyces spp. Mucor spp., Escherichia, such as Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Candida spp. and Saccharomyces spp., such as Saccharomyces cerevisae.
Antimycotic Activity
In addition, the inventive active ingredients also have very good antimycotic activity. They have a very broad antimycotic activity spectrum, especially against dermatophytes and yeasts, moulds and diphasic fungi (for example against Candida species, such as C. albicans, C. glabrata), and Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species, such as A. niger and A. fumigatus, Trichophyton species, such as T. mentagrophytes, Microsporon species such as M. canis and M. audouinii. The list of these fungi by no means constitutes a restriction of the mycotic spectrum covered, and is merely of illustrative character.
The inventive active ingredients can therefore be used both in medical and in non-medical applications.
Application Rates and Timing
When using the inventive active ingredients as fungicides, the application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind of application. The application rate of the inventive active ingredients is
in the case of treatment of plant parts, for example leaves: from 0.1 to 10 000 g/ha, preferably from 10 to 1000 g/ha, more preferably from 10 to 800 g/ha, even more preferably from 50 to 300 g/ha (in the case of application by watering or dripping, it is even possible to reduce the application rate, especially when inert substrates such as rockwool or perlite are used);
in the case of seed treatment: from 2 to 200 g per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 3 to 150 g per 100 kg of seed, more preferably from 2.5 to 25 g per 100 kg of seed, even more preferably from 2.5 to 12.5 g per 100 kg of seed;
in the case of soil treatment: from 0.1 to 10 000 g/ha, preferably from 1 to 5000 g/ha.
These application rates are merely by way of example and are not limiting for the purposes of the invention.
The inventive active ingredients or compositions comprising a compound according to formula (I) can thus be used to protect plants from attack by the pathogens mentioned for a certain period of time after treatment. The period for which protection is provided extends generally for 1 to 28 days, preferably for 1 to 14 days, more preferably for 1 to 10 days, most preferably for 1 to 7 days, after the treatment of the plants with the active ingredients, or for up to 200 days after a seed treatment.
The plants listed can particularly advantageously be treated in accordance with the invention with the compounds of the general formula (I) and the inventive compositions. The preferred ranges stated above for the active ingredients or compositions also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or compositions specifically mentioned in the present text.
The invention is illustrated by the examples below. However, the invention is not limited to the examples.

The log P values were measured according to EEC directive 79/831 Annex V.A8 by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) on reversed-phase columns (C18), using the methods below:
[a] The LC-MS determination in the acidic range is effected at pH 2.7 with 0.1% aqueous formic acid and acetonitrile (contains 0.1% formic acid) as eluents; linear gradient from 10% acetonitrile to 95% acetonitrile.
The calibration is effected with unbranched alkan-2-ones (having 3 to 16 carbon atoms) with known log P values (log P values determined on the basis of the retention times by linear interpolation between two successive alkanones).
The lambda-max values were determined in the maxima of the chromatographic signals using the UV spectra from 200 nm to 400 nm.
NMR Data of Selected Examples
NMR Peak List Method
The 1H NMR data of selected examples are stated in the form of 1H NMR peak lists. For each signal peak, first the 6-value in ppm and then the signal intensity in round brackets are listed. The 6 value-signal intensity number pairs for different signal peaks are listed with separation from one another by semicolons.
The peak list for one example therefore takes the form of:

Intensity of sharp signals correlates with the height of the signals in a printed example of a NMR spectrum in cm and shows the real relations of signal intensities. From broad signals several peaks or the middle of the signal and their relative intensity in comparison to the most intensive signal in the spectrum can be shown.
For calibrating chemical shift for 1H spectra, we use tetramethylsilane and/or the chemical shift of the solvent used, especially in the case of spectra measured in DMSO. Therefore in NMR peak lists, tetramethylsilane peak can occur but not necessarily.
The 1H-NMR peak lists are similar to classical 1H-NMR prints and contain therefore usually all peaks, which are listed at classical NMR-interpretation.
Additionally they can show like classical 1H-NMR prints signals of solvents, stereoisomers of the target compounds, which are also object of the invention, and/or peaks of impurities.
To show compound signals in the delta-range of solvents and/or water the usual peaks of solvents, for example peaks of DMSO in DMSO-D6 and the peak of water are shown in our 1H-NMR peak lists and have usually on average a high intensity.
The peaks of stereoisomers of the target compounds and/or peaks of impurities have usually on average a lower intensity than the peaks of target compounds (for example with a purity >90%).
Such stereoisomers and/or impurities can be typical for the specific preparation process. Therefore their peaks can help to recognize the reproduction of our preparation process via “side-products-fingerprints”.
An expert, who calculates the peaks of the target compounds with known methods (MestreC, ACD-simulation, but also with empirically evaluated expectation values) can isolate the peaks of the target compounds as needed optionally using additional intensity filters. This isolation would be similar to relevant peak picking at classical 1H-NMR interpretation.
